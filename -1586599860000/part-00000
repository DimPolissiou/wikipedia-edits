The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours.

After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] of the [[Holy See]] for evaluation at the universal level of the Church.<ref name=how6191 /> If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title \"[[The_Venerable|Venerable]]\" (stage 2).<ref name=how6191>{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/question6191.htm|title=The Steps of Canonization|work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref> Further investigation, step 3, may lead to the candidate's [[beatification]] with the title \"Blessed\",<ref name=how6191 /> which is elevation to the class of the ''[[beatification|Beati]]''. Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. These miracles must be posthumous.<ref name=how6191 /> Finally, in the last stage, after all of these procedures are complete, the [[Pope]] may canonize the candidate as a saint<ref name=how6191 /> for veneration by the universal Church.\n\n=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===\n{{Further|Glorification}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in [[heaven]], whether recognized here on earth, or not.<ref name=bebis /> By this definition, [[Adam and Eve]], [[Moses]], the various [[prophet]]s, except for the [[angel]]s and [[archangel]]s are all given the title of \"Saint\". Sainthood in the Orthodox Church does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but the communion with God: there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance, such as [[Mary of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black|Moses the Ethiopian]], and [[Saint Dismas|Dysmas]], the repentant thief who was crucified. Therefore, a more complete Eastern Orthodox definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of humankind, saved inside them the entire Church, and loved all people.\n\nOrthodox belief considers that God reveals saints through answered prayers and other miracles. Saints are usually recognized by a local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognized by the entire church. The word \"canonization\" means that a Christian has been found worthy to have his name placed in the canon (official list) of saints of the Church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops.<ref name=bebis /> The Orthodox Church does not require the manifestation of miracles; what is required is evidence of a virtuous life.\n\nIf the ecclesiastical review is successful, this is followed by a service of Glorification in which the Saint is given a day on the church calendar to be celebrated by the entire church.<ref>Frawley J ''[http://www.oca.org/FS.NA-Document.asp?ID=83 The Glorification of the Saints in the Orthodox Church]'' at Orthodox Church in America, Syosset, New York</ref> This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the Church ultimately recognized it.\n\nAs a general rule only [[clergy]] will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession, however, in [[veneration]] the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The [[altar]] in an Orthodox church usually contains relics of saints,<ref>Hopko T \"[http://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/worship/the-church-building/altar-table The Orthodox Faith]\"</ref> often of [[martyr]]s. Church interiors are covered with the [[Icon]]s of saints. When an Orthodox Christian venerates icons of a saint he is venerating the image of God which he sees in the saint.\n\nBecause the Church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead (the saints are considered to be alive in Heaven), saints are referred to as if they were still alive. Saints are venerated but not worshiped. They are believed to be able to intercede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with God or by personal intervention.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the title [[wikt:\u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2|\u1f4d\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2]], ''Hosios'' (f. \u1f49\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ''Hosia'') is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a [[monastery|monastic]] or [[Hermit|eremitic]] life, and it is equal to the more usual title of \"Saint\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches \u2012 the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Tewahedo Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] \u2012 follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint's death before the Coptic Orthodox Church's [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|pope]] can canonize the saint.\n\n=== Anglicanism ===\n{{Main|Saints in Anglicanism}}\n\nIn the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Continuing Anglicanism|Continuing Anglican]] movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|12:1|KJV}}). The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognise the existence of the saints in heaven.\n\nIn [[high-church]] contexts, such as [[Anglo-Catholicism]], a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and [[sanctity]]. In this use, a saint is therefore not merely a [[belief|believer]], but one who has been transformed by virtue. In [[Catholicism]], a saint is a special sign of God's activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed \"hagiolatry\".\n\nSo far as invocation of the saints is concerned,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#22 |title=Article XXII |publisher=Eskimo.com |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> one of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] \"Of [[Purgatory]]\" condemns \"the Romish Doctrine concerning...(the) Invocation of Saints\" as \"a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God\". Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a \"Romish\" and a \"Patristic\" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E.J. Bicknell stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term \"invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.\"<ref name=\"Sokol2001\">{{cite book|last=Sokol|first=David F.|title=The Anglican Prayer Life: Ceum Na Corach', the True Way|year=2001|isbn=978-0-595-19171-0|page=14|quote=In 1556 Article XXII in part read... \"The Romish doctrine concerning...invocation of saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the word of God.\" The term \"doctrina Romanensium\" or Romish doctrine was substituted for the \"doctrina scholasticorum\" of the doctrine of the school authors in 1563 to bring the condemnation up to date subsequent to the Council of Trent. As E.J. Bicknell writes, invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.}}</ref>\n\nSome Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.\n\nAnglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected.<ref name=\"Sokol2001\" /> There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between \"mediator\" and \"intercessor\", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglican Catholics]] understand sainthood in a more [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.\n\nAccording to the [[Church of England]], a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorised King James Version (1611) [[2 Chronicles]] 6:41: <blockquote>\nNow therefore arise, O {{LORD}} God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O {{LORD}} God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Lutheranism ===\n{{Further|Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)}}\n[[File:AugsburgConfessionXXIOfTheWorshipoftheSaints.JPG|left|thumb|\"Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them.

However, the church still recognizes and honors specific saints, including some of those recognized by the Catholic Church, but in a qualified way: according to the [[Augsburg Confession]],<ref>A Confession of Faith Presented in Augsburg by certain Princes and Cities to His Imperial Majesty Charles V in the Year 1530</ref> the term \"saint\" is used in the manner of the Catholic Church only insofar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace, was sustained by faith, and whose good works are to be an example to any Christian. Traditional Lutheran belief accounts that prayers ''to'' the saints are prohibited, as they are not mediators of redemption.<ref>[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 14\u201330</ref><ref>[[Smalcald Articles]]-II 25</ref> But, Lutherans do believe that saints pray for the Christian Church in general.<ref>[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 9</ref> [[Philip Melanchthon]], the author of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, approved honoring the saints by saying they are honored in three ways:\n:1. By thanking God for examples of His mercy;\n:2. By using the saints as examples for strengthening our faith; and\n:3. By imitating their faith and other virtues.<ref>[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 4\u20137</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAINTS.VENERATIONOF|title=Lutheran Church \u2013 Missouri Synod \u2013 Christian Cyclopedia|work=lcms.org}}</ref><ref>[[Augsburg Confession]] XXI 1</ref>\n\nThe Lutheran Churches also have [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|liturgical calendars]] in which they honor individuals as saints.\n\nThe intercession of saints was criticized in the ''[[:s:Augsburg Confession#Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints.|Augsburg Confession, Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints]]''. This criticism was rebutted by the Catholic side in the ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/confutatio.php#article21|title=1530 Roman Confutation|website=bookofconcord.org}}</ref> which in turn was rebutted by the Lutheran side in the ''Apology to the Augsburg Confession''.<ref>''Apology to the Augsburg Confession, [http://bookofconcord.org/defense_20_saints.php#article21 Article XXI : Of the Invocation of Saints]''</ref>\n\n=== Methodism ===\n{{Further|Saints in Methodism}}\n\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not venerate saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are ''saints'', but mainly use the term to refer to biblical figures, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints\u2014such as the [[Twelve Apostles]], [[John Wesley]], etc.\u2014although most are named after geographical locations associated with an early [[Methodist circuit|circuit]] or prominent location. Methodist congregations observe [[All Saints' Day]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Daily Bible Study |url=https://www.methodist.org.uk/our-faith/the-bible/a-word-in-time/2016/30-october-5-november-2016/tuesday/ |publisher=[[Methodist Church in Britain]] |accessdate=15 June 2019 |language=en |quote=[T]day we reach one of the high points of the Christian Year - All Saints Day.}}</ref> Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biographies of holy people.\n\nThe 14th Article of Religion in the [[United Methodist]] ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]]'' states:\n<blockquote>The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church |date=2016 |publisher=[[Cokesbury]] |isbn=978-1-501-83321-2 |page=104}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== {{anchor|Protestantism}} Other Protestantism ===\n<!-- This (Protestantism) section is linked from [[Universal priesthood (doctrine)]] -->\n<!-- [[Saints in Protestantism]] redirects to this section -->\n\nIn many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah. p. 150.</ref> In this sense, anyone who is within the [[Body of Christ]] (i.e., a professing Christian) is a \"saint\" because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider [[Intercession of saints|intercessory prayers to the saints]] to be [[idolatry]], since an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p38.htm |title=The Sin of Idolatry and the Catholic Concept of Iconic Participation |publisher=Philvaz.com |accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWithin some Protestant traditions, \"saint\" is also used to refer to any [[born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]. Many emphasize the traditional [[New Testament]] meaning of the word, preferring to write \"saint\" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]].\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===\nThe beliefs within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification \"latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the \"latter days\", before the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and is used to distinguish the members of the church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church.<ref>{{cite web |last= Smith |first= Joseph Jr |authorlink= Joseph Smith Jr |title= Pearl of Great Price |url= http://lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000817204117/http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2000-08-17}}</ref> Members are therefore often referred to as \"[[Latter-day Saints]]\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"saints\".<ref>M.

In many religions, there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many [[world religions]]. The Jewish ''hasid'' or ''tsaddiq'', the Islamic ''qidees'', the Zoroastrian ''fravashi'', the Hindu ''rsi'' or ''guru,'' the Buddhist ''arahant'' or ''bodhisattva,'' the Daoist ''shengren,'' the Shinto ''kami,'' and others have all been referred to as saints.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Thomson Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|date=2005|edition=Second|volume=Sainthood|page=8033|language=TG}}</ref>\n\n=== African diaspora ===\n{{See also|Afro-American religion}}\n\nCuban [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Trinidad Orisha|Trinidad Orisha-Shango]], Brazilian [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]], and other similar [[syncretism|syncretist]] religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the [[deity|deities]]. The name ''santer\u00eda'' was originally a pejorative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n{{See also|Bodhisattva|Arhat}}\n\nBuddhists in both the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions hold the ''[[Arhat]]s'' in special esteem, as well as highly developed [[Bodhisattvas]].\n\n[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] hold the ''[[tulku]]s'' (reincarnates of deceased eminent practitioners) as living saints on earth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hindu saints}}\n\nHindu saints are those recognized by [[Hindu]]s as showing a great degree of holiness and sanctity. Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal [[canonization]] process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general. Unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Essentials of Hinduism|last = Bhaskarananda|first = Swami|publisher = The Vedanta Society of Western Washington|year = 2002|isbn = 978-1-884852-04-6|location = Seattle|pages = 12}}</ref> Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called [[guru]]s, [[sadhu]]s, [[rishi]]s, [[devarishi]]s, [[rajarshi]]s, [[saptarishi]]s, [[brahmarshi]]s, [[swami]]s, [[Pandit|pundits]], [[purohit]]s, [[pujari]]s, [[acharya]]s, [[pravaras]], [[yogi]]s, [[yogini]]s, and other names.<ref name=\"Rinehart2004\">{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA88|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=87\u201390}}</ref>\n\nSome Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as [[Avatar|incarnations]] of [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devi]], and other aspects of the Divine\u2014this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths.

In [[Sunni Islam]], the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on,<ref name=\"See John Renard 2008\"/> and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of \"special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Radtke, B., \"Saint\", in: Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.</ref> The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both \"loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \"Belief in the miracles of saints (''kar\u0101m\u0101t al-awliy\u0101\u02be'') ...

Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad'' (London: Oneworld Publications, 2015), p. 254</ref> the specific traditional practices which [[Salafism]] has tried to curtail in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] contexts include those of [[wali|the veneration of saints]], [[ziyara|visiting their graves]], [[tawassul|seeking their intercession]], and [[relics|honoring their relics]]. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: \"[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints\u2026. [Due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\"<ref>Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\n=== Judaism ===\n{{Main|Tzadik}}\n\nThe term ''Tzadik'' (\"righteous\"), and its associated meanings, developed in [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic thought]] from its [[Talmud]]ic contrast with ''[[Hasid (term)|Hasid]]'' (\"pious\"), to its exploration in [[Musar literature|ethical literature]], and its esoteric spiritualisation in [[Kabbalah]]. In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance, combining former elite mysticism with social movement for the first time.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{See also|Sant (religion)}}\nThe concept of ''[[Sant Mat|sant]]'' or ''[[bhagat]]'' is found in North Indian religious thought including [[Sikhism]], most notably in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. Figures such as [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdev]], and others are known as \"Sants\" or \"Bhagats\". The term ''Sant'' is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God ([[Naam Japo]]). Countless names of God exist. In Sikhism, ''Naam'' (spiritual internalization of God's name) is commonly attained through the name of [[Waheguru]], which translates to \"Wondrous Guru\".\n\nSikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or \"The Company of the Holy\". ''Sants'' grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through ''Naam''. ''Sants'' are to be distinguished from \"Guru\" (such as [[Guru Nanak]]) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Gurus are the physical incarnation of God upon Earth. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one.<ref name=Khalsa>{{cite book | title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib: English Translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib | publisher=Hand Made Books (Mandeep Singh) | author=Khalsa, Sant Singh  | year=2007 | location=Arizona | pages=12\u2013263}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n* [[Calendar of saints]]\n* [[Communion of saints]]\n* [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]\n* [[Hagiography]]\n* [[Hallow]]\n* [[List of bodhisattvas]]\n* [[List of canonizations]]\n* [[List of saints|List of Christian saints]]\n** [[List of saints from Africa]]\n** [[List of American saints and beatified people]]\n** [[List of Breton saints]]\n** [[List of Canadian Roman Catholic saints]]\n** [[List of Coptic saints]]\n** [[List of saints of India]]\n** [[List of saints of the Society of Jesus]]\n** [[List of Russian saints]]\n* [[List of Hindu gurus and sants]]\n* [[List of Sufi saints]]\n* [[Martyrology]]\n* [[Sage (philosophy)]]\n* [[Saint Companions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Beyer, J\u00fcrgen, et al., eds.

Although the term \"[[worship]]\" is sometimes used, it is only used with the older English connotation of honoring or respecting (''[[dulia]]'') a person. According to the Church, Divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to God (''[[latria]]'') and never to the saints.<ref>Scully, Teresita '' [http://www.americancatholic.org/features/customs/rosary/mary_worship.asp Do Catholics Worship Mary?]'' on American Catholic.org</ref> One is permitted to ask the saints to intercede or pray to God for persons still on Earth,<ref>[http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp The Intercession of the Saints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619002648/http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp |date=19 June 2009 }} on Catholic.com</ref> just as one can ask someone on Earth to pray for him.\n\nA saint may be designated as a [[patron saint]] of a particular cause, profession, or locale, or invoked as a protector against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official declarations of the Church.<ref>[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Patron Saints|Patron Saints]] from Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on Wikisource.org</ref> Saints are not believed to have power of their own, but only that granted by God.

The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours.

After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] of the [[Holy See]] for evaluation at the universal level of the Church.<ref name=how6191 /> If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title \"[[The_Venerable|Venerable]]\" (stage 2).<ref name=how6191>{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/question6191.htm|title=The Steps of Canonization|work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref> Further investigation, step 3, may lead to the candidate's [[beatification]] with the title \"Blessed\",<ref name=how6191 /> which is elevation to the class of the ''[[beatification|Beati]]''. Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. These miracles must be posthumous.<ref name=how6191 /> Finally, in the last stage, after all of these procedures are complete, the [[Pope]] may canonize the candidate as a saint<ref name=how6191 /> for veneration by the universal Church.\n\n=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===\n{{Further|Glorification}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in [[heaven]], whether recognized here on earth, or not.<ref name=bebis /> By this definition, [[Adam and Eve]], [[Moses]], the various [[prophet]]s, except for the [[angel]]s and [[archangel]]s are all given the title of \"Saint\". Sainthood in the Orthodox Church does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but the communion with God: there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance, such as [[Mary of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black|Moses the Ethiopian]], and [[Saint Dismas|Dysmas]], the repentant thief who was crucified. Therefore, a more complete Eastern Orthodox definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of humankind, saved inside them the entire Church, and loved all people.\n\nOrthodox belief considers that God reveals saints through answered prayers and other miracles. Saints are usually recognized by a local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognized by the entire church. The word \"canonization\" means that a Christian has been found worthy to have his name placed in the canon (official list) of saints of the Church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops.<ref name=bebis /> The Orthodox Church does not require the manifestation of miracles; what is required is evidence of a virtuous life.\n\nIf the ecclesiastical review is successful, this is followed by a service of Glorification in which the Saint is given a day on the church calendar to be celebrated by the entire church.<ref>Frawley J ''[http://www.oca.org/FS.NA-Document.asp?ID=83 The Glorification of the Saints in the Orthodox Church]'' at Orthodox Church in America, Syosset, New York</ref> This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the Church ultimately recognized it.\n\nAs a general rule only [[clergy]] will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession, however, in [[veneration]] the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The [[altar]] in an Orthodox church usually contains relics of saints,<ref>Hopko T \"[http://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/worship/the-church-building/altar-table The Orthodox Faith]\"</ref> often of [[martyr]]s. Church interiors are covered with the [[Icon]]s of saints. When an Orthodox Christian venerates icons of a saint he is venerating the image of God which he sees in the saint.\n\nBecause the Church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead (the saints are considered to be alive in Heaven), saints are referred to as if they were still alive. Saints are venerated but not worshiped. They are believed to be able to intercede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with God or by personal intervention.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the title [[wikt:\u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2|\u1f4d\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2]], ''Hosios'' (f. \u1f49\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ''Hosia'') is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a [[monastery|monastic]] or [[Hermit|eremitic]] life, and it is equal to the more usual title of \"Saint\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches \u2012 the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Tewahedo Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] \u2012 follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint's death before the Coptic Orthodox Church's [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|pope]] can canonize the saint.\n\n=== Anglicanism ===\n{{Main|Saints in Anglicanism}}\n\nIn the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Continuing Anglicanism|Continuing Anglican]] movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|12:1|KJV}}). The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognise the existence of the saints in heaven.\n\nIn [[high-church]] contexts, such as [[Anglo-Catholicism]], a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and [[sanctity]]. In this use, a saint is therefore not merely a [[belief|believer]], but one who has been transformed by virtue. In [[Catholicism]], a saint is a special sign of God's activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed \"hagiolatry\".\n\nSo far as invocation of the saints is concerned,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#22 |title=Article XXII |publisher=Eskimo.com |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> one of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] \"Of [[Purgatory]]\" condemns \"the Romish Doctrine concerning...(the) Invocation of Saints\" as \"a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God\". Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a \"Romish\" and a \"Patristic\" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E.J. Bicknell stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term \"invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.\"<ref name=\"Sokol2001\">{{cite book|last=Sokol|first=David F.|title=The Anglican Prayer Life: Ceum Na Corach', the True Way|year=2001|isbn=978-0-595-19171-0|page=14|quote=In 1556 Article XXII in part read... \"The Romish doctrine concerning...invocation of saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the word of God.\" The term \"doctrina Romanensium\" or Romish doctrine was substituted for the \"doctrina scholasticorum\" of the doctrine of the school authors in 1563 to bring the condemnation up to date subsequent to the Council of Trent. As E.J. Bicknell writes, invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.}}</ref>\n\nSome Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.\n\nAnglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected.<ref name=\"Sokol2001\" /> There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between \"mediator\" and \"intercessor\", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglican Catholics]] understand sainthood in a more [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.\n\nAccording to the [[Church of England]], a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorised King James Version (1611) [[2 Chronicles]] 6:41: <blockquote>\nNow therefore arise, O {{LORD}} God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O {{LORD}} God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Lutheranism ===\n{{Further|Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)}}\n[[File:AugsburgConfessionXXIOfTheWorshipoftheSaints.JPG|left|thumb|\"Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them.

By thanking God for examples of His mercy;\n:2. By using the saints as examples for strengthening our faith; and\n:3. By imitating their faith and other virtues.<ref>[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 4\u20137</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAINTS.VENERATIONOF|title=Lutheran Church \u2013 Missouri Synod \u2013 Christian Cyclopedia|work=lcms.org}}</ref><ref>[[Augsburg Confession]] XXI 1</ref>\n\nThe Lutheran Churches also have [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|liturgical calendars]] in which they honor individuals as saints.\n\nThe intercession of saints was criticized in the ''[[:s:Augsburg Confession#Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints.|Augsburg Confession, Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints]]''. This criticism was rebutted by the Catholic side in the ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/confutatio.php#article21|title=1530 Roman Confutation|website=bookofconcord.org}}</ref> which in turn was rebutted by the Lutheran side in the ''Apology to the Augsburg Confession''.<ref>''Apology to the Augsburg Confession, [http://bookofconcord.org/defense_20_saints.php#article21 Article XXI : Of the Invocation of Saints]''</ref>\n\n=== Methodism ===\n{{Further|Saints in Methodism}}\n\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not venerate saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are ''saints'', but mainly use the term to refer to biblical figures, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints\u2014such as the [[Twelve Apostles]], [[John Wesley]], etc.\u2014although most are named after geographical locations associated with an early [[Methodist circuit|circuit]] or prominent location. Methodist congregations observe [[All Saints' Day]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Daily Bible Study |url=https://www.methodist.org.uk/our-faith/the-bible/a-word-in-time/2016/30-october-5-november-2016/tuesday/ |publisher=[[Methodist Church in Britain]] |accessdate=15 June 2019 |language=en |quote=[T]day we reach one of the high points of the Christian Year - All Saints Day.}}</ref> Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biographies of holy people.\n\nThe 14th Article of Religion in the [[United Methodist]] ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]]'' states:\n<blockquote>The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church |date=2016 |publisher=[[Cokesbury]] |isbn=978-1-501-83321-2 |page=104}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== {{anchor|Protestantism}} Other Protestantism ===\n<!-- This (Protestantism) section is linked from [[Universal priesthood (doctrine)]] -->\n<!-- [[Saints in Protestantism]] redirects to this section -->\n\nIn many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian.

Many Protestants consider [[Intercession of saints|intercessory prayers to the saints]] to be [[idolatry]], since an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p38.htm |title=The Sin of Idolatry and the Catholic Concept of Iconic Participation |publisher=Philvaz.com |accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWithin some Protestant traditions, \"saint\" is also used to refer to any [[born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]. Many emphasize the traditional [[New Testament]] meaning of the word, preferring to write \"saint\" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]].\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===\nThe beliefs within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification \"latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the \"latter days\", before the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and is used to distinguish the members of the church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church.<ref>{{cite web |last= Smith |first= Joseph Jr |authorlink= Joseph Smith Jr |title= Pearl of Great Price |url= http://lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000817204117/http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2000-08-17}}</ref> Members are therefore often referred to as \"[[Latter-day Saints]]\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"saints\".<ref>M.

The Jewish ''hasid'' or ''tsaddiq'', the Islamic ''qidees'', the Zoroastrian ''fravashi'', the Hindu ''rsi'' or ''guru,'' the Buddhist ''arahant'' or ''bodhisattva,'' the Daoist ''shengren,'' the Shinto ''kami,'' and others have all been referred to as saints.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Thomson Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|date=2005|edition=Second|volume=Sainthood|page=8033|language=TG}}</ref>\n\n=== African diaspora ===\n{{See also|Afro-American religion}}\n\nCuban [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Trinidad Orisha|Trinidad Orisha-Shango]], Brazilian [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]], and other similar [[syncretism|syncretist]] religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the [[deity|deities]].

Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal [[canonization]] process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general. Unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Essentials of Hinduism|last = Bhaskarananda|first = Swami|publisher = The Vedanta Society of Western Washington|year = 2002|isbn = 978-1-884852-04-6|location = Seattle|pages = 12}}</ref> Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called [[guru]]s, [[sadhu]]s, [[rishi]]s, [[devarishi]]s, [[rajarshi]]s, [[saptarishi]]s, [[brahmarshi]]s, [[swami]]s, [[Pandit|pundits]], [[purohit]]s, [[pujari]]s, [[acharya]]s, [[pravaras]], [[yogi]]s, [[yogini]]s, and other names.<ref name=\"Rinehart2004\">{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA88|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=87\u201390}}</ref>\n\nSome Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as [[Avatar|incarnations]] of [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devi]], and other aspects of the Divine\u2014this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths.

In [[Sunni Islam]], the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on,<ref name=\"See John Renard 2008\"/> and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of \"special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Radtke, B., \"Saint\", in: Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.</ref> The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both \"loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \"Belief in the miracles of saints (''kar\u0101m\u0101t al-awliy\u0101\u02be'') ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],\"<ref>Jonathan A.C. Brown, \"Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints,\" ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123</ref> with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of [[ziyara|grave visitation]] like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] emphatically declaring: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The [[Quran]] has pointed to it in different places, and the [[hadith|sayings of the Prophet]] have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators.\"<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'' (al-Madani Publishing House, 1980), p. 603</ref> The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the [[Sufi]]s, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the [[maddhab|four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law]].<ref>John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008)</ref>\n\nVeneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the [[Salafi movement]], whose various streams regard it as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\"<ref>Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 600</ref>  In a manner similar to the [[Protestant Reformation]],<ref>See Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad'' (London: Oneworld Publications, 2015), p. 254</ref> the specific traditional practices which [[Salafism]] has tried to curtail in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] contexts include those of [[wali|the veneration of saints]], [[ziyara|visiting their graves]], [[tawassul|seeking their intercession]], and [[relics|honoring their relics]]. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: \"[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints\u2026. [Due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\"<ref>Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\n=== Judaism ===\n{{Main|Tzadik}}\n\nThe term ''Tzadik'' (\"righteous\"), and its associated meanings, developed in [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic thought]] from its [[Talmud]]ic contrast with ''[[Hasid (term)|Hasid]]'' (\"pious\"), to its exploration in [[Musar literature|ethical literature]], and its esoteric spiritualisation in [[Kabbalah]]. In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance, combining former elite mysticism with social movement for the first time.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{See also|Sant (religion)}}\nThe concept of ''[[Sant Mat|sant]]'' or ''[[bhagat]]'' is found in North Indian religious thought including [[Sikhism]], most notably in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. Figures such as [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdev]], and others are known as \"Sants\" or \"Bhagats\". The term ''Sant'' is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God ([[Naam Japo]]). Countless names of God exist. In Sikhism, ''Naam'' (spiritual internalization of God's name) is commonly attained through the name of [[Waheguru]], which translates to \"Wondrous Guru\".\n\nSikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or \"The Company of the Holy\". ''Sants'' grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through ''Naam''. ''Sants'' are to be distinguished from \"Guru\" (such as [[Guru Nanak]]) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Gurus are the physical incarnation of God upon Earth. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one.<ref name=Khalsa>{{cite book | title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib: English Translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib | publisher=Hand Made Books (Mandeep Singh) | author=Khalsa, Sant Singh  | year=2007 | location=Arizona | pages=12\u2013263}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n* [[Calendar of saints]]\n* [[Communion of saints]]\n* [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]\n* [[Hagiography]]\n* [[Hallow]]\n* [[List of bodhisattvas]]\n* [[List of canonizations]]\n* [[List of saints|List of Christian saints]]\n** [[List of saints from Africa]]\n** [[List of American saints and beatified people]]\n** [[List of Breton saints]]\n** [[List of Canadian Roman Catholic saints]]\n** [[List of Coptic saints]]\n** [[List of saints of India]]\n** [[List of saints of the Society of Jesus]]\n** [[List of Russian saints]]\n* [[List of Hindu gurus and sants]]\n* [[List of Sufi saints]]\n* [[Martyrology]]\n* [[Sage (philosophy)]]\n* [[Saint Companions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Beyer, J\u00fcrgen, et al., eds.

The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby the Seal.\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nSome of the characters appearing in ''Pingu'' are given below.\n\n===Main===\n* Pingu is the main character of the series, a typically playful, sometimes naughty, curious little boy [[penguin]]. His name comes from the German word for penguin, ''{{lang|de|Pinguin}}''. He is strong-willed and mostly well-behaved but prone to making mischief and throwing occasional tantrums.\n* Pinga is Pingu's younger sister. She resembles an [[emperor penguin]] chick, as do other infant/toddler penguins throughout the show. Like all toddlers, she is happy and playful but very sensitive and clever, and is often a target for Pingu's practical jokes.\n* Mother and Father are Pingu and Pinga's parents; their actual names are not revealed. Father is a postman who uses a non-smoking pipe in the early episodes, but quits later. He is a short-tempered but loving penguin and has a motorised sledge ([[snowmobile]]) to deliver the mail, sometimes with help from Pingu. Mother is a caring, loving and hardworking housewife who spends most of her time cooking and cleaning. Mother sometimes gets help from Pingu and Pinga, and she always gives them a cuddle when they have learned a lesson.\n* Grandfather is Pingu and Pinga's paternal grandfather, who first appeared in the episode \"Music Lessons\". He is an expert accordionist, as he demonstrates to Pingu in that episode, and is also a former professional weight lifter.\n* Grandpa is Pingu and Pinga's maternal grandfather who appeared in \"Grandpa is Ill\" and \"Pingu Cannot Lose\", in the latter of which he is shown to be good at bowling.\n* Aunts are Mother's sisters and Pingu and Pinga's three maternal aunts. In \"Pingu Goes Away\", Pingu goes to stay with one of his aunts. In \"Pingu the Babysitter\", he cares for another aunt's twin chicks whilst she and Mother go out, then in \"Pingu Makes a Mistake\", he cares for his other aunt's egg that is due to hatch.\n* The Twins are Pingu and Pinga's cousins who appear in \"Pingu the Babysitter\" where they are cared for by Pingu when their mother (Pingu's aunt) goes out with Mother.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Robby is a [[Pinniped|seal]]. His name resembles the German word for seal, ''{{lang|de|Robbe}}''. First appearing in the episode \"Pingu Goes Fishing\", he is friendly and playful, yet cheeky in a lot of ways. He is bluish-grey in the first four seasons.\n* Pingo is a somewhat foolhardy penguin. He has a long beak that is essentially flat at the bottom but slightly rounded on the top and a head that is wider and taller. He often persuades Pingu to do wild and silly things with him.\n* Pingg is Pingu's other penguin friend. He also has a long beak, but a shorter head than Pingo.\n* Pongi is a penguin who wears glasses and has a short round beak. He first appeared in the episode \"Ice Hockey\".\n* Pengy is a penguin very similar to [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s, and first appears in \"Pingu and the School Excursion\". In the episode \"School Time\", Pingu resembles Pengy.\n* Pingj is a green penguin who appears in ''Pingu at the Wedding Party''; he speaks with an accent that seems to be typical of his race.\n* Punki is a penguin who first appeared in the episode \"Pingu Delivers The Mail\". He has a tuft on his head and wears striped trousers. Punki only appears in a handful of episodes.\n* Bajoo is Pingu's other non-penguin friend. [[HIT Entertainment]] reveals him as a \"strange newcomer\" to the Antarctic in the appearance of an [[Yeti|abominable snowman]]. He debuted in 2005, and appeared in the final episode, \"Pingu & the Abominable Snowman\". He also appeared in the 7\u201311 music video and \"The Pingu Show\".\n* Pingi is Pingu's love interest and Pinga's best friend. She has thick, white eyelashes and a somewhat mushed beak. She first appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Admirer\".\n\n===Supporting===\n* The Schoolmaster (Mr. Peng-Chips) is Pingu's teacher. He lives in a nearby school and rings the bell when it is time for school to begin or end. He first appeared in the episode \"School Time\".\n* The Doctor is the neighborhood's doctor. He lives in a nearby igloo clinic and frequently treats Pingu's injuries, as well as aid in the birth of Pinga.\n* Mr. Peng-Hoven is a poor penguin. He lives in a tattered igloo and gladly accepts Pingu's gifts. He first appeared in \"Pingu and the Barrel Organ\".\n* The Giant Walrus is a mysterious German character who appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Dream\". As Pingu sleeps, he dreams his bed comes to life and takes him on a ride, unaware that the giant non-tusked walrus is stalking him. He eventually shows up and confronts him before trapping him in an igloo. He lets him out and uses him as a stretch toy while laughing maniacally. The walrus then eats Pingu's mattress, allowing Pingu to escape. Pingu then falls down a slope and wakes up in the real world, where his mother consoles him after his nightmare.\n\n==Production history==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=December 2017}}\nThe original production from 1988&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;2006 created 156 five-minute episodes and [[Pingu at the Wedding Party|one special 25-minute episode]]. The episodes were written by [[Silvio Mazzola]] and were directed and animated by [[Otmar Gutmann]] using [[clay animation]], at [[Trickfilmstudio]] in [[Russikon]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Pingu |accessdate=21 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310140008/http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |archivedate=10 March 2008}}</ref> In the style of voices a [[Retroscripting|retroscript]] was chosen, and all voices were performed by Italian voice actor [[Carlo Bonomi]] without a script, using a language of noises that he had already developed and used for [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''. This feature enables people of different linguistic backgrounds to be able to follow the story.\n\nIn 1993, [[David Hasselhoff]] released a single titled \"Pingu Dance\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727162700/http://www.david-hasselhoff.com/multimedia.html Music- & Soundfiles / Musik- & Sounddateien]. david-hasselhoff.com</ref> a [[hip hop music|rap]] song (in Switzerland only) based on the ''Pingu'' shorts and featuring samples of Penguinese. A portion of this song is used as the theme to ''Pingu'' in international airings, and was also heard in the re-dubbed version of the \"Pingu Looks After the Egg (retitled Pingu Helps with Incubating)\" episode, replacing the \"[[Woodpeckers from Space]]\" song from the original version.\n\nA special twenty-five-minute episode, ''[[Pingu at the Wedding Party]]'', was also produced in 1997, and introduced a family of green penguins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/pingu-family-at-the-wedding-party/ |title=Pingu Family at the Wedding Party |work=ABC Television}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, [[HIT Entertainment]] bought the rights to the series, including the original 104 episodes and the wedding special, for \u00a315.9 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pingu sold for \u00a316m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1626014.stm |work=Business |publisher=BBC News |date=29 October 2001 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> HIT later revived the show, and produced a further 52 episodes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hit-entertainment-plc-announces-record-year-end-2002-results-76228802.html |title=HIT Entertainment PLC Announces Record Year End 2002 Results |author=HIT Entertainment PLC |date=14 October 2002 |work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> created at [[Hot Animation]] Studios in 2003 through 2006.

When HIT Entertainment bought the rights, [[Carlo Bonomi]] was replaced with new voice actors Marcello Magni and [[David Sant]]. Magni and Sant, Italian and Spanish actors based in London, both have a mime and clowning background and were already aware of the clown language of \"[[Grammelot]]\" on which the penguin language was based.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\"/>\n\nIn 2006, after the last episode aired, ''Pingu'' finally ended its 16-year run on TV.\n\n''Pingu'' had aired on [[Nickelodeon (UK & Ireland)|Nickelodeon]] in the UK for a period of time in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980204185916/http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |title=What's on Nickelodeon UK |archivedate=4 February 1998 |work=nickelodeon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe very first time Pingu was ever mentioned in the US was on a documentary called Pingu - A Cartoon Character who conquers the world<ref>{{Citation |last=Sandro Mazzola |title=Pingu - a cartoon character conquers the world |date=24 February 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvJqiGKo7Hw |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> where a detective tries to figure out why Pingu is so popular, at the time Pingu was shown at the Paley Center.

The program featured various animated shorts produced internationally, and ran from 1996 until the show's discontinuation in 2001. The series did not air in the US from 2002 until 2005, when reruns of the series returned to the country on [[PBS Kids Sprout]], but was removed sometime in 2010.

It centers on a family of anthropomorphic penguins who live at the South Pole, and the main character is the family's son and title character, Pingu.\n\nThe series originally ran for four series (each ''series'' is made up of multiple ''seasons'') from 28 May 1986 to 9 April 2000 on [[SF DRS]] and was then renewed for two more series from 1 August 2003 to 3 March 2006 on [[BBC Two]]. ''Pingu'' was also nominated for a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA award]].

The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby the Seal.\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nSome of the characters appearing in ''Pingu'' are given below.\n\n===Main===\n* Pingu is the main character of the series, a typically playful, sometimes naughty, curious little boy [[penguin]]. His name comes from the German word for penguin, ''{{lang|de|Pinguin}}''. He is strong-willed and mostly well-behaved but prone to making mischief and throwing occasional tantrums.\n* Pinga is Pingu's younger sister. She resembles an [[emperor penguin]] chick, as do other infant/toddler penguins throughout the show. Like all toddlers, she is happy and playful but very sensitive and clever, and is often a target for Pingu's practical jokes.\n* Mother and Father are Pingu and Pinga's parents; their actual names are not revealed. Father is a postman who uses a non-smoking pipe in the early episodes, but quits later. He is a short-tempered but loving penguin and has a motorised sledge ([[snowmobile]]) to deliver the mail, sometimes with help from Pingu. Mother is a caring, loving and hardworking housewife who spends most of her time cooking and cleaning. Mother sometimes gets help from Pingu and Pinga, and she always gives them a cuddle when they have learned a lesson.\n* Grandfather is Pingu and Pinga's paternal grandfather, who first appeared in the episode \"Music Lessons\". He is an expert accordionist, as he demonstrates to Pingu in that episode, and is also a former professional weight lifter.\n* Grandpa is Pingu and Pinga's maternal grandfather who appeared in \"Grandpa is Ill\" and \"Pingu Cannot Lose\", in the latter of which he is shown to be good at bowling.\n* Aunts are Mother's sisters and Pingu and Pinga's three maternal aunts. In \"Pingu Goes Away\", Pingu goes to stay with one of his aunts. In \"Pingu the Babysitter\", he cares for another aunt's twin chicks whilst she and Mother go out, then in \"Pingu Makes a Mistake\", he cares for his other aunt's egg that is due to hatch.\n* The Twins are Pingu and Pinga's cousins who appear in \"Pingu the Babysitter\" where they are cared for by Pingu when their mother (Pingu's aunt) goes out with Mother.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Robby is a [[Pinniped|seal]]. His name resembles the German word for seal, ''{{lang|de|Robbe}}''. First appearing in the episode \"Pingu Goes Fishing\", he is friendly and playful, yet cheeky in a lot of ways. He is bluish-grey in the first four seasons.\n* Pingo is a somewhat foolhardy penguin. He has a long beak that is essentially flat at the bottom but slightly rounded on the top and a head that is wider and taller. He often persuades Pingu to do wild and silly things with him.\n* Pingg is Pingu's other penguin friend. He also has a long beak, but a shorter head than Pingo.\n* Pongi is a penguin who wears glasses and has a short round beak. He first appeared in the episode \"Ice Hockey\".\n* Pengy is a penguin very similar to [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s, and first appears in \"Pingu and the School Excursion\". In the episode \"School Time\", Pingu resembles Pengy.\n* Pingj is a green penguin who appears in ''Pingu at the Wedding Party''; he speaks with an accent that seems to be typical of his race.\n* Punki is a penguin who first appeared in the episode \"Pingu Delivers The Mail\". He has a tuft on his head and wears striped trousers. Punki only appears in a handful of episodes.\n* Bajoo is Pingu's other non-penguin friend. [[HIT Entertainment]] reveals him as a \"strange newcomer\" to the Antarctic in the appearance of an [[Yeti|abominable snowman]]. He debuted in 2005, and appeared in the final episode, \"Pingu & the Abominable Snowman\". He also appeared in the 7\u201311 music video and \"The Pingu Show\".\n* Pingi is Pingu's love interest and Pinga's best friend. She has thick, white eyelashes and a somewhat mushed beak. She first appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Admirer\".\n\n===Supporting===\n* The Schoolmaster (Mr. Peng-Chips) is Pingu's teacher. He lives in a nearby school and rings the bell when it is time for school to begin or end. He first appeared in the episode \"School Time\".\n* The Doctor is the neighborhood's doctor. He lives in a nearby igloo clinic and frequently treats Pingu's injuries, as well as aid in the birth of Pinga.\n* Mr. Peng-Hoven is a poor penguin. He lives in a tattered igloo and gladly accepts Pingu's gifts. He first appeared in \"Pingu and the Barrel Organ\".\n* The Giant Walrus is a mysterious German character who appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Dream\". As Pingu sleeps, he dreams his bed comes to life and takes him on a ride, unaware that the giant non-tusked walrus is stalking him. He eventually shows up and confronts him before trapping him in an igloo. He lets him out and uses him as a stretch toy while laughing maniacally. The walrus then eats Pingu's mattress, allowing Pingu to escape. Pingu then falls down a slope and wakes up in the real world, where his mother consoles him after his nightmare.\n\n==Production history==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=December 2017}}\nThe original production from 1988&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;2006 created 156 five-minute episodes and [[Pingu at the Wedding Party|one special 25-minute episode]]. The episodes were written by [[Silvio Mazzola]] and were directed and animated by [[Otmar Gutmann]] using [[clay animation]], at [[Trickfilmstudio]] in [[Russikon]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Pingu |accessdate=21 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310140008/http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |archivedate=10 March 2008}}</ref> In the style of voices a [[Retroscripting|retroscript]] was chosen, and all voices were performed by Italian voice actor [[Carlo Bonomi]] without a script, using a language of noises that he had already developed and used for [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''. This feature enables people of different linguistic backgrounds to be able to follow the story.\n\nIn 1993, [[David Hasselhoff]] released a single titled \"Pingu Dance\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727162700/http://www.david-hasselhoff.com/multimedia.html Music- & Soundfiles / Musik- & Sounddateien]. david-hasselhoff.com</ref> a [[hip hop music|rap]] song (in Switzerland only) based on the ''Pingu'' shorts and featuring samples of Penguinese. A portion of this song is used as the theme to ''Pingu'' in international airings, and was also heard in the re-dubbed version of the \"Pingu Looks After the Egg (retitled Pingu Helps with Incubating)\" episode, replacing the \"[[Woodpeckers from Space]]\" song from the original version.\n\nA special twenty-five-minute episode, ''[[Pingu at the Wedding Party]]'', was also produced in 1997, and introduced a family of green penguins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/pingu-family-at-the-wedding-party/ |title=Pingu Family at the Wedding Party |work=ABC Television}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, [[HIT Entertainment]] bought the rights to the series, including the original 104 episodes and the wedding special, for \u00a315.9 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pingu sold for \u00a316m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1626014.stm |work=Business |publisher=BBC News |date=29 October 2001 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> HIT later revived the show, and produced a further 52 episodes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hit-entertainment-plc-announces-record-year-end-2002-results-76228802.html |title=HIT Entertainment PLC Announces Record Year End 2002 Results |author=HIT Entertainment PLC |date=14 October 2002 |work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> created at [[Hot Animation]] Studios in 2003 through 2006.

When HIT Entertainment bought the rights, [[Carlo Bonomi]] was replaced with new voice actors Marcello Magni and [[David Sant]]. Magni and Sant, Italian and Spanish actors based in London, both have a mime and clowning background and were already aware of the clown language of \"[[Grammelot]]\" on which the penguin language was based.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\"/>\n\nIn 2006, after the last episode aired, ''Pingu'' finally ended its 16-year run on TV.\n\n''Pingu'' had aired on [[Nickelodeon (UK & Ireland)|Nickelodeon]] in the UK for a period of time in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980204185916/http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |title=What's on Nickelodeon UK |archivedate=4 February 1998 |work=nickelodeon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe very first time Pingu was ever mentioned in the US was on a documentary called Pingu - A Cartoon Character who conquers the world<ref>{{Citation |last=Sandro Mazzola |title=Pingu - a cartoon character conquers the world |date=24 February 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvJqiGKo7Hw |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> where a detective tries to figure out why Pingu is so popular, at the time Pingu was shown at the Paley Center. Then the series began airing in the United States on a morning omnibus program titled ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', as part of [[Cartoon Network]]'s Sunday morning lineup. The program featured various animated shorts produced internationally, and ran from 1996 until the show's discontinuation in 2001. The series did not air in the US from 2002 until 2005, when reruns of the series returned to the country on [[PBS Kids Sprout]], but was removed sometime in 2010.

It can still be seen on TV in that country since [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] airs \"The Pingu Show\" as part of its morning children's programming block \"APTN Kids\", and the show is available in English and [[French language]] versions.
