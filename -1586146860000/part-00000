Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.

This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]].

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.

It is located on the [[Tampa Reservation]] off of [[Interstate 4]], just east of [[Tampa, Florida]]. The 190,000 square foot casino is the sixth-largest in the world, and has been expanded multiple times since its opening. It is a 24-hour venue that permits smoking indoors.\n\nIt includes many displays of [[rock and roll]] memorabilia, such as clothing and musical instruments. Rock videos and music play on multiple screens, including one displayed inside a waterfall. Many song lyrics are displayed on the walls. Among its many services are a [[food court]] and [[tour bus]] parking. Special membership cards allow points accumulated by gambling to be redeemed for retail discounts.\n\n==History==\nIn 1980, while excavating to build a parking garage in downtown Tampa, Indian remains were discovered. They were exhumed and relocated to 8.3 acres of land east of Tampa, that was granted reservation status to the Seminole Tribe one year later. Taking advantage of reservation status, the tribe opened a museum, a [[smoke shop]] and a high-stakes bingo hall by 1982. Eventually a Four Points [[Sheraton Hotel]] opened on the land, and slot machines and poker were added to games offered. In 2000, the Seminoles announced plans to rebuild the casino as a Hard Rock Casino. The Hard Rock Casino opened in 2003, with the hotel opening the following year. Over time, the [[Florida Legislature]] has changed laws allowing new games at the casino, including Vegas-style [[slot machine]]s and [[blackjack]]. Major expansions of the casino occurred in 2007 and 2012, making it the largest in Florida.\n\n==Features==\nAside from the casino, the hotel has a 12-story tower, a pool, a [[fitness center]], and three [[parking garage]]s. There are many restaurants, including the locally acclaimed Council Oak Steak House, The Fresh Harvest buffet, Rock and Raw sushi bar, The Rise Deli, JuBao Noodle Palace, an international food court, a large [[Hard Rock Cafe]], which regularly hosts live stage performances, as well as others. For shopping there are multiple stores, including the Rain Maker tribal gift shop, the Hard Rock Store and a Seminole Smoke Shop. There are also multiple bars located around the casino floor, including the L Bar, the Center Bar and others. Additional features include a non-smoking game room and a high-rollers club room. Musical memorabilia exhibits can be found throughout the complex.\n\nIn 2019, a 14-story hotel tower was added to the property<ref>https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seminole-hard-rock-hotel--casino-tampa-reveals-700-million-expansion-completion-with-grand-celebration-300930978.html</ref>.\n\n==Casino==\nThe 190,000+ square foot casino is the fourth-largest in the United States and sixth-largest in the world. It features over 5,000 Vegas-style slot machines and over 110 tables. One of the showgirls there admits Rich Bantock has a smaller \"deck of cards\" in his pants( if you know what I mean) than Erik Moon.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of casinos in Florida]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*<ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/features/popculture/article983319.ece Tampabay.com]</ref>\n*<ref>[http://www.seminolehardrocktampa.com/tampa-casino Seminole Hard Rock Website]</ref>\n*<ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/expansion-puts-seminole-hard-rock-casino-in-top-tier-of-gaming-halls/1238375 Tampabay.com]</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* {{official}}\n{{Coord|27.993549|-82.372806|display=t}}\n\n{{HCFPEI}}\n{{Hard Rock Hotel and Casino locations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tampa}}\n[[Category:Casinos completed in 2004]]\n[[Category:Hotel buildings completed in 2004]]\n[[Category:Hard Rock Cafe]]\n[[Category:Native American casinos]]\n[[Category:Seminole tribe]]\n[[Category:Hotels in Tampa, Florida]]\n[[Category:Casinos in Florida]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Tampa, Florida]]\n[[Category:Casino hotels]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:The Cordish Companies]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox casino\n| name            = Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino\n| logo            = \n| logo_size       = 150\n| logo_alt        = \n| logo_caption    = \n| image           = \n| image_size      = \n| image_alt       = \n| image_caption   = \n| location        = \n| address         = 5223 North Orient Road, Tampa, Florida 33610\n| date_opened     = 2004\n| date_closed     = \n| theme           = [[Rock and Roll]] / [[Music]]\n| rooms           = \n| space_gaming    = 190,000sq ft\n| shows           = \n| attractions     = \n| notable_restaurants = [[Hard Rock Cafe]]<br>''Council Oak Steaks & Seafood''\n| casino_type     = Land-based\n| owner           = [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]]\n| license_holder  = \n| architect       = \n| names_pre       = Four Points [[Sheraton Hotel]]\n| renovations     = \n| website         = {{official URL}}\n| footnotes       = \n}}\n\nThe '''Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tampa''' is a gaming complex and hotel that opened in 2004.

Throughout this article, the prefix ''The Rt Hon.'' is omitted, because every Counsellor bears it, as is the postnominal ''PC'', as every Counsellor who is also a peer uses it.\n\nThe Council is composed mostly of politicians (be they from the British government, other parties, or Commonwealth governments) and civil servants, both current and retired (since membership is for life). Among those politicians generally sworn of the council are Ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Loyal Opposition]], the Parliamentary leader of the third-largest party (currently [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] Westminster Leader [[Ian Blackford]]), and a couple of the most senior figures in the devolved British governments, including the First Ministers. Besides these, the Council includes a very few members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] (usually the [[Prince consort|consort]] and [[heir apparent]] only), a few dozen judges (the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court Justices]], the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Judges]] of England and Wales, and the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Senators of the College of Justice]] of the [[Inner House]] in Scotland) and a few clergy (the three most senior [[List of bishops in the Church of England|Church of England bishops]]).\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|notes=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes|seealso=yes|nobreak=yes}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! align=\"right\" | Non-partisan\n| style=\"background-color: #8800FF;\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]/[[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Household]]\n| style=\"background-color: #BB88FF;\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]]\n| style=\"background-color: #33CCCC;\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[Church of England|Clergy]]\n| style=\"background-color: #008800;\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[Courts of the United Kingdom|HM judiciary]]\n| style=\"background-color: #66AA88;\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[judiciary]]\n|-\n! align=\"right\" | Partisan\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}};\" |\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};\" |\n| width=\"160\" | [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician\n| style=\"background-color: {{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}};\" |\n| [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]/[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib.

The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" ([[Shetland dialect]]: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|2010b}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the nine crew members believed to have been on board were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}} The wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\nThe wreck of the ''Ben Doran'' is used as a dive site for sport divers and underwater photographers.{{sfn|Shetland.org|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\nOn the 9th December 1977 ''Elinor Viking'', an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the east side of Reaverack{{sfn|Canmore - Elinor Viking|}} due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled,{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} including Captain George Bain as the chief pilot, and Major Alasdair Campbell as a [[Winch|winchman]].{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nThey reached the scene within about an hour and, with the aid of another helicopter and an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] trying to provide light in the dark conditions, they proceeded with the rescue attempt in horrendous weather. The light coming from dropped flares from the Nimrod was deemed impossible to time correctly with the winch lowering, such that their only effective source of light was the helicopter's landing lights. ''Elinor Viking'' had developed considerable list as it began to sink. Campbell, upon his first attempt being lowered down to the ship, was unexpectedly swayed and his cable became caught in the mast of the ship. The risk of losing the helicopter meant that the winch operator nearly took the decision to sever the cable to Campbell, however he was able to be retrieved back into the helicopter and immediately offered to be lowered again. Using a rock which was repeatedly out of view with the swell as the best reference, Bain was able to keep the aircraft steady to continue the rescue. Through the following hour and twenty minutes, lowering approximately twelve times, Campbell was able to hoist up the crew.{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}} The last to leave the ship was the skipper, who (either through hypothermia or shock) could not let go of the ships railing, requiring Bain to hit him to continue the rescue.{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nDespite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were successfully winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} Both Bain and Campbell received [[Queen's Gallantry Medal|Queen's Gallantry Medals]] for \"outstanding bravery, skill and determination in conditions of extreme weather and darkness operating in a situation far beyond that normally expected of a helicopter on rescue service.\"{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|Coelleira aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel ''Coelleira'' was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene.

The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''.

It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nFollowing his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo (Shetland dialect: a hut of loosely constructed stone for [[Food drying|wind-drying]] meat or fish){{sfn|Graham|2010a}} in Hamnavoe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Papa Stour]]\n* [[St Magnus Bay]]\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n* [[List of shipwrecks of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Selkie]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2209|title=skeo|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010a|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010b|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" ([[Shetland dialect]]: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|2010b}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the nine crew members believed to have been on board were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}} The wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\nThe wreck of the ''Ben Doran'' is used as a dive site for sport divers and underwater photographers.{{sfn|Shetland.org|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\nOn the 9th December 1977 ''Elinor Viking'', an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the east side of Reaverack{{sfn|Canmore - Elinor Viking|}} due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled,{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} including Captain George Bain as the chief pilot, and Major Alasdair Campbell as a [[Winch|winchman]].{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nThey reached the scene within about an hours and, with the aid of another helicopter and an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] trying to provide light in the dark conditions, they proceeded with the rescue attempt in horrendous weather. The light coming from dropped flares from the Nimrod was deemed impossible to time correctly with the winch lowering, such that their only effective source of light was the helicopter's landing lights. ''Elinor Viking'' had developed considerable list as it began to sink. Campbell, upon his first attempt being lowered down to the ship, was unexpectedly swayed and his cable became caught in the mast of the ship. The risk of losing the helicopter meant that the winch operator nearly took the decision to sever the cable to Campbell, however he was able to be retrieved back into the helicopter and immediately offered to be lowered again. Using a rock which was repeatedly out of view with the swell as the best reference, Bain was able to keep the aircraft steady to continue the rescue. Through the following hour and twenty minutes, lowering approximately twelve times, Campbell was able to hoist up the crew.{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}} The last to leave the ship was the skipper, who (either through hypothermia or shock) could not let go of the ships railing, requiring Bain to hit him to continue the rescue.{{sfn|Telegraph|2012}}\n\nDespite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were successfully winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}} Both Bain and Campbell received [[Queen's Gallantry Medal|Queen's Gallantry Medals]] for \"outstanding bravery, skill and determination in conditions of extreme weather and darkness operating in a situation far beyond that normally expected of a helicopter on rescue service.\"{{sfn|London Gazette|1978|p=8046}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|Coelleira aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel ''Coelleira'' was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene. All 15{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=12}} crew were winched aboard the helicopter, and were returned to [[Lerwick]] uninjured.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries post salvage attempt.jpg|left|thumb|''Coelleira'' on its port side after the salvage attempt]]\nAttempts were subsequently made to refloat the vessel. The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''.

MacKay, it was first lit on 27 September 1979. It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nFollowing his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo (Shetland dialect: a hut of loosely constructed stone for [[Food drying|wind-drying]] meat or fish){{sfn|Graham|2010a}} in Hamnavoe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Papa Stour]]\n* [[St Magnus Bay]]\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n* [[List of shipwrecks of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Selkie]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2209|title=skeo|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010a|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John J.|date=2010b|website=Shetland ForWirds|orig-year=1979|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

[[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]] claimed the area for [[New France]] after his 1679 expedition on the ''[[Le Griffon|Griffon]]''.\n\nIn 1784, after the [[American Revolutionary War]], Francis Navarre of Canada was given a portion of land south of the [[River Raisin]] by the Potawatomi. Colonists settled [[Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan|Frenchtown]] shortly thereafter as the third European community in what in the early 19th century became the state of Michigan.  Around the same time, the [[Sandy Creek (Michigan)|Sandy Creek Settlement]] was established just north of Frenchtown by French-Canadian Joseph Porlier Benec.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.monroeinfo.com/set1_source.html |title = Monroe, Michigan historical markers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195508/http://www.monroeinfo.com/set1_source.html |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n   | align     = left\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 250\n   | footer    = Front Street looking east toward the [[Old Village Historic District (Monroe, Michigan)|Old Village]] around the year 1900 ''(top)'' and in 2010 ''(bottom)''\n   | image1    = West Monroe Front Street (circa 1900).png\n   | alt1      = Front Street 2010\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = MonroeFrontStreet.png\n   | alt2      = Front Street 1900\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\nBecause of its proximity to [[Detroit]], the area was of strategic importance during the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and Great Britain, especially after [[Fort Detroit]] surrendered to the British in August 1812. American forces en route to retake Detroit had camped in the area of the River Raisin in the winter of 1812\u201313. A force of 200 Native Americans and 63 Canadian militia were forced to retreat north away from the River Raisin by 600 Kentucky militiamen and 100 French, under the command of [[James Winchester]], on January 18, 1813. This skirmish was later dubbed the 'First Battle of the River Raisin'.\n\nBut, on January 22, 1813, a force of 800 Native Americans and 597 British, under [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Proctor]], surprised the force of 1,000 Americans and captured Frenchtown. Many of the American militia were inexperienced, ill-trained, and badly equipped. They suffered 397 killed and 547 captured. The British and their allies had only slight losses.\n\nWhen the British departed with their captives to Detroit, they left those Americans too wounded to walk in the homes of Frenchtown inhabitants under the guard of a small British detachment and Native American allies, including Potawatomi. The morning after the battle, other Native Americans returned to Frenchtown. They plundered and burned homes, and killed and ritually scalped many of the remaining American captives, taking others as slaves. The official U.S. estimate of casualties in this aftermath include a dozen named individuals killed and up to 30 more who were likely killed. The British estimated six Americans were killed.\n\nThis event became known throughout the United States as the \"River Raisin Massacre\". This was also known as the [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (or the Second Battle of the River Raisin).<ref>{{cite web|author=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/rira/historyculture/index.htm|title=History & Culture|department=River Raisin National Battlefield Park |publisher= National Park Service}}</ref> Today, the site of the battle is preserved as the [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]], authorized in 2009.<ref name = \"MonroeNews\">{{cite news | author = Monroe Evening News staff | title = Battlefield Bill Signing Celebrated | url = http://www.monroenews.com/article/20090331/NEWS01/703319972/-1/NEWS | work = [[Monroe Evening News]] |date = March 31, 2009 | access-date = April 3, 2009 }}</ref> It is the first and so far the only national battlefield established for a War of 1812 site.

M-130 had its eastern terminus at US&nbsp;24 and ran for just over nine miles (14&nbsp;km).  In 1955, control of the highway was transferred back to the county.  Today, it is called North Custer Road.\n*[[File:Dixie Highway marker.svg|20px|alt=|link=]] [[Dixie Highway]] ran through Monroe in as early as 1915.  It was originally one of the few ways to reach places like [[Florida]], but the highway was largely replaced by I-75 beginning in the 1960s.  Today, the namesake of the highway is used for two non-connecting highways (one being M-125), although the same route and remnants of the original highway are long gone.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US 1948 |25}} was the designated name for the portion of Dixie Highway north of [[Cincinnati]], including the portion running through Monroe.

Historic railroads operating until the 1950s-60s were the Pere Marquette, Ann Arbor, Wabash, Grand Trunk Western, and the Detroit, Toledo, and Ironton. The Baltimore and Ohio had trackage rights with the PM and the Wabash upon which to operate its Detroit to Toledo passenger trains such as the Ambassador which after Toledo continued to Washington, D.C. and from there northward to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.<ref>Railroad schedules of the 1950s with their included maps</ref> \n===Interurbans===\nFrom 1900 to the 1930s, the electric Detroit United Railway (eventually becoming the Eastern Michigan Ry) operated hourly interurban passenger service between Detroit and Toledo through Monroe. The DU/EM provided valuable and frequent passenger transportation plus carryed freight at a time of unpaved and unreliable roads. The gradual business lost as Michigan and Ohio and their towns paved highways in the 1920s and resulting growing truck and automobile use, plus the 1930-32 dramatic loss of business caused by the economic impact of the Great Depression shut the interurban down in 1932. The Eastern Michigan had carried considerable freight and passengers from Detroit to Cleveland exchanged with the Lake Shore Electric interurban at Toledo. Similarly, it had carried freight and passengers from Detroit to Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati exchanged with the Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban at Toledo. <ref>The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad, p76-77, p108.

In 1817, portions of the [[Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan|Frenchtown]] settlement along the [[River Raisin]] were [[plat]]ted and renamed Monroe after then-president [[James Monroe]].

Several structures are named after Custer, including [[Custer Airport]]. The city also contains numerous other historic structures. Founded in 1928, the [[La-Z-Boy]] world headquarters are located in Monroe.\n\n==History==\nLong occupied by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, the area around the [[River Raisin]] was settled by the historic [[Potawatomi]] hundreds of years before French explorers and colonists reached it in the late seventeenth century. [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]] claimed the area for [[New France]] after his 1679 expedition on the ''[[Le Griffon|Griffon]]''.\n\nIn 1784, after the [[American Revolutionary War]], Francis Navarre of Canada was given a portion of land south of the [[River Raisin]] by the Potawatomi. Colonists settled [[Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan|Frenchtown]] shortly thereafter as the third European community in what in the early 19th century became the state of Michigan.  Around the same time, the [[Sandy Creek (Michigan)|Sandy Creek Settlement]] was established just north of Frenchtown by French-Canadian Joseph Porlier Benec.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.monroeinfo.com/set1_source.html |title = Monroe, Michigan historical markers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195508/http://www.monroeinfo.com/set1_source.html |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n   | align     = left\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 250\n   | footer    = Front Street looking east toward the [[Old Village Historic District (Monroe, Michigan)|Old Village]] around the year 1900 ''(top)'' and in 2010 ''(bottom)''\n   | image1    = West Monroe Front Street (circa 1900).png\n   | alt1      = Front Street 2010\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = MonroeFrontStreet.png\n   | alt2      = Front Street 1900\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\nBecause of its proximity to [[Detroit]], the area was of strategic importance during the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and Great Britain, especially after [[Fort Detroit]] surrendered to the British in August 1812. American forces en route to retake Detroit had camped in the area of the River Raisin in the winter of 1812\u201313. A force of 200 Native Americans and 63 Canadian militia were forced to retreat north away from the River Raisin by 600 Kentucky militiamen and 100 French, under the command of [[James Winchester]], on January 18, 1813. This skirmish was later dubbed the 'First Battle of the River Raisin'.\n\nBut, on January 22, 1813, a force of 800 Native Americans and 597 British, under [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)]], surprised the force of 1,000 Americans and captured Frenchtown. Many of the American militia were inexperienced, ill-trained, and badly equipped. They suffered 397 killed and 547 captured. The British and their allies had only slight losses.\n\nWhen the British departed with their captives to Detroit, they left those Americans too wounded to walk in the homes of Frenchtown inhabitants under the guard of a small British detachment and Native American allies, including Potawatomi. The morning after the battle, other Native Americans returned to Frenchtown. They plundered and burned homes, and killed and ritually scalped many of the remaining American captives, taking others as slaves. The official U.S. estimate of casualties in this aftermath include a dozen named individuals killed and up to 30 more who were likely killed. The British estimated six Americans were killed.\n\nThis event became known throughout the United States as the \"River Raisin Massacre\". This was also known as the [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (or the Second Battle of the River Raisin).<ref>{{cite web|author=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/rira/historyculture/index.htm|title=History & Culture|department=River Raisin National Battlefield Park |publisher= National Park Service}}</ref> Today, the site of the battle is preserved as the [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]], authorized in 2009.<ref name = \"MonroeNews\">{{cite news | author = Monroe Evening News staff | title = Battlefield Bill Signing Celebrated | url = http://www.monroenews.com/article/20090331/NEWS01/703319972/-1/NEWS | work = [[Monroe Evening News]] |date = March 31, 2009 | access-date = April 3, 2009 }}</ref> It is the first and so far the only national battlefield established for a War of 1812 site.

Splitting off from I-75, I-275 is a western bypass around Detroit but does not actually merge back with I-75.  Aside from I-75, the highway can be accessed near Monroe by US&nbsp;24 (Telegraph Road) via exit 2.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|50}} terminates in Monroe at US&nbsp;24 and provides a direct route to [[Dundee, Michigan|Dundee]], [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], and further.

M-130 had its eastern terminus at US&nbsp;24 and ran for just over nine miles (14&nbsp;km).  In 1955, control of the highway was transferred back to the county.  Today, it is called North Custer Road.\n*[[File:Dixie Highway marker.svg|20px|alt=|link=]] [[Dixie Highway]] ran through Monroe in as early as 1915.  It was originally one of the few ways to reach places like [[Florida]], but the highway was largely replaced by I-75 beginning in the 1960s.  Today, the namesake of the highway is used for two non-connecting highways (one being M-125), although the same route and remnants of the original highway are long gone.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US 1948 |25}} was the designated name for the portion of Dixie Highway north of [[Cincinnati]], including the portion running through Monroe.  Like Dixie Highway, US&nbsp;25 was largely replaced, and the existing highway was truncated at Cincinnati.\n*[[File:Airport Sign.svg|20px|alt=|link=]] [[Custer Airport]] was built in 1946 and is located on the former M-130.  It is a very small and seldom used airport.  There are no commercial or passenger flights departing from or arriving at Custer Airport.  There is one paved runway used by small personal airplanes.

Historic railroads operating until the 1950s-60s were the Pere Marquette, Ann Arbor, Wabash, Grand Trunk Western, and the Detroit, Toledo, and Ironton. The Baltimore and Ohio had trackage rights with the PM and the Wabash upon which to operate its Detroit to Toledo passenger trains such as the Ambassador which after Toledo continued to Washington, D.C. and from there northward to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.<ref>Railroad schedules of the 1950s with their included maps</ref> \n===Interurbans===\nFrom 1900 to the 1930s, the electric Detroit United Railway (eventually becoming the Eastern Michigan Ry) operated hourly interurban passenger service between Detroit and Toledo through Monroe. The DU/EM provided valuable and frequent passenger transportation plus carryed freight at a time of unpaved and unreliable roads. The gradual business lost as Michigan and Ohio and their towns paved highways in the 1920s and resulting growing truck and automobile use, plus the 1930-32 dramatic loss of business caused by the economic impact of the Great Depression shut the interurban down in 1932. The Eastern Michigan had carried considerable freight and passengers from Detroit to Cleveland exchanged with the Lake Shore Electric interurban at Toledo. Similarly, it had carried freight and passengers from Detroit to Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati exchanged with the Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban at Toledo. <ref>The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad, p76-77, p108.
