As with other Latin works, the number of books is frequently appended to the title, hence the occasional rendering ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri CXLII'', (\"From the Founding of the City in 142 Books\").<ref>Livy, xliii. 13.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Livius\">{{cite DGRBM|volume=II |page=790 |title=Livius}}</ref>}} is a monumental [[history of ancient Rome]], written in [[Latin]] between 27 and 9 BC by the historian [[Titus Livius]], or \"Livy\", as he is usually known in English.{{efn-lr|Various indications point to the period from 27 to 20 BC as that during which the first decade was written. In the first book (xix. 3) the emperor is called ''Augustus'', a title which he was granted by the [[Roman Senate]] early in 27, and in ix. 18 the omission of all reference to the restoration, in 20, of the standards taken at Carrhae seems to justify the inference that the passage was written before that date.  In the epitome of book lix, there is a reference to a law of Augustus which was passed in 18.<ref>{{EB1911 |inline=y|first=Henry Francis |last=Pelham |authorlink=Henry Francis Pelham |wstitle=Livy |volume=16 |pages=817\u2013823}}</ref>}} The work covers the period from the legends concerning the arrival of [[Aeneas]] and the refugees from the fall of [[Troy]], to the [[Founding of Rome|city's founding]] in 753, the expulsion of the [[King of Rome|Kings]] in 509, and down to Livy's own time, during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]].{{efn-lr|Livy uses the chronology of [[Varro]], one of his predecessors, whose chronology was the most widely accepted in antiquity, and remains in general use today, although scholars continue to debate the dating of specific events, including the founding of Rome itself.}}{{efn-lr|In Roman times, it was customary to date events according to the consuls of each year, rather than assigning each year a numerical name; so while it was possible to date events by reference to the founding of Rome, this was rarely done.  For instance, the consuls of 439 BC were Agrippa Menenius Lanatus and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, so that year would typically be referred to as \"the consulship of Agrippa Menenius and Titus Quinctius\", rather than \"the year three hundred and fifteen\".  From this custom, the consuls who began each year are sometimes referred to as the ''eponymous magistrates'' of that year; that is, the magistrates after whom the year was named.}} The last event covered by Livy is the death of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] in 9 BC.<ref name=\"DGRBM Livius\"/>  About 25% of the work survives (35 books of 142).<ref>Foster (1874), p. xvi.</ref> The surviving books deal with the events down to 293 BC, and from 219 to 166 BC.\n\n==Contents==\n\n===Corpus===\nThe ''History of Rome'' originally comprised 142 \"books\", thirty-five of which\u2014Books 1\u201310 with the Preface and Books 21\u201345\u2014still exist in reasonably complete form.<ref name=\"DGRBM Livius\"/> Damage to a manuscript of the 5th century resulted in large gaps ([[Lacuna (manuscripts)|''lacunae'']]) in Books 41 and 43\u201345 (small lacunae exist elsewhere); that is, the material is not covered in any source of Livy's text.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hardwick |first=Lorna |year=2003 |title=Reception Studies |series=Greece & Rome: New Surveys in the Classics No. 33 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press for the Classical Association |page=23}}</ref>\n\nA fragmentary [[palimpsest]] of the 91st book was discovered in the [[Vatican Library]] in 1772, containing about a thousand words (roughly three paragraphs), and several papyrus fragments of previously unknown material, much smaller, have been found in Egypt since 1900, most recently about 40 words from Book 11, unearthed in 1986.<ref>Chantal Gabriellin \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556494 Lucius Postumius Megellus at Gabii: A New Fragment of Livy]\" in ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 53, No. 1 (May, 2003), pp. 247-259.</ref>\n\nSome passages are nevertheless known thanks to quotes from ancient authors, the most famous being on the death of [[Cicero]], quoted by [[Seneca the Elder]].\n\n===Abridgements===\n[[File:Papyrus PSI 1291 - Epitome of Livy XLVII\u2013XLVIII - Egyptian Museum, Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.4|Fragment of [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P.

Collins defines the \"annalistic method\" as \"naming the public officers and recording the events of each succeeding year\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=William Lucas |year=1876 |title=Livy |pages=13\u201314 |publisher=J.B. Lippincott & Co |location=Philadelphia}}</ref> It is an expansion of the [[fasti]], the official public chronicles kept by the magistrates, which were a primary source for Roman historians. Those who seem to have been more influenced by the method have been termed [[annalists]].\n\nThe first and third decades (see below) of Livy's work are written so well that Livy has become a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of curricula in Golden Age Latin. Some have argued that subsequently the quality of his writing began to decline, and that he becomes repetitious and wordy. Of the 91st book [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] says \"repetitions are here so frequent in the small compass of four pages and the prolixity so great, that we should hardly believe it to belong to Livy....\" Niebuhr accounts for the decline by supposing \"the writer has grown old and become loquacious...\", going so far as to conjecture that the later books were lost because copyists refused to copy such low-quality work.<ref>Niebuhr (1844), p. 38.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=Which tome exactly? Niebuhr's works are online, please add a link to the book.}}\n\nA [[digression]] in Book 9, Sections 17\u201319, suggests that the Romans would have beaten [[Alexander the Great]] if he had lived longer and had turned west to attack the Romans, making this digression the oldest known [[alternate history]].<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-last=Dozois |editor1-first=Gardner |editor1-link=Gardner Dozois |year=1998 |editor2-last=Schmidt |editor2-first=Stanley |title=Roads Not Taken: Tales of Alternate History |publisher=Del Rey |location=New York |pages=1\u20135 |isbn=978-0-345-42194-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Livy's publication==\n[[File:Ab Urbe condita.tif|thumb|''Ab Urbe condita'', 1714]]\nThe first five books were published between 27 and 25 BC. The first date mentioned is the year [[Augustus]] received that title: twice in the first five books Livy uses it.<ref>Foster (1874), p. xi, citing Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|I.19]] and [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 4#20|IV.20]].</ref> For the second date, Livy lists the closings of the temple of [[Janus]] but omits that of 25 (it had not happened yet).<ref>Foster (1874), p. xi, citing Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|I.19]].</ref>\n\nLivy continued to work on the ''History'' for much of the rest of his life, publishing new material by popular demand. This explains why the work falls naturally into 12 packets, mainly groups of 10 books, or decades, sometimes of 5 books (pentads or {{proper name|pentades}}) and the rest without any packet order. The scheme of dividing it entirely into decades is a later innovation of copyists.<ref>Foster (1874), pp xv\u2013xvi.</ref>\n\nThe second pentad did not come out until 9 or after, some 16 years after the first pentad. In Book IX Livy states that the [[Silva Ciminia|Cimminian Forest]] was more impassable than the German had been recently, referring to the [[Hercynian Forest]] (Black Forest) first opened by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Ahenobarbus]].<ref>Niebuhr (1844), p. 39, citing [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 10#36|Livy IX.36]].</ref> One can only presume that in the interval Livy's first pentad had been such a success that he had to yield to the demand for more.\n\n==Manuscripts==\nThere is no uniform system of classifying and naming manuscripts. Often the relationship of one [[manuscript]] (MS) to another remains unknown or changes as perceptions of the handwriting change. Livy's release of chapters by packet diachronically encouraged copyists to copy by decade. Each decade has its own conventions, which do not necessarily respect the conventions of any other decade. A family of MSS descend through copying from the same MSS (typically lost). MSS vary widely; to produce an emendation or a printed edition was and is a major task. Usually variant readings are given in footnotes.\n\n===First decade===\nAll of the manuscripts (except one) of the first ten books (first decade) of ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'', which were copied through the Middle Ages and were used in the first printed editions, are derived from a single [[recension]] commissioned by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], consul, AD 391.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hedrick | first=Charles W. |year=2000 |title=History and Silence: Purge and Rehabilitation of Memory in Late Antiquity |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73121-9 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref> A recension is made by comparing extant manuscripts and producing a new version, an [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]], based on the text that seems best to the editor. The latter then \"subscribed\" to the new MS by noting on it that he had emended it.\n\nSymmachus, probably using the authority of his office, commissioned Tascius Victorianus to emend the first decade. Books I\u2013IX bear the subscription ''Victorianus emendabam dominis Symmachis'', \"I Victorianus emended (this) by the authority of Symmachus.\" Books VI\u2013VIII include another subscription preceding it, that of Symmachus' son-in-law, [[Nicomachus Flavianus (son)|Nicomachus Flavianus]], and Books III\u2013V were also emended by Flavianus' son, [[Appius Nicomachus Dexter]], who says he used his relative Clementianus' copy.<ref name=\"foster32-36\">Foster (1874), pp. xxxii\u2013xxxvi</ref> This recension and family of descendant MSS is called the Nicomachean, after two of the subscribers. From it several MSS descend (incomplete list):<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hall |first=Frederick William |year=1913 |title=A companion to classical texts |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=246\u2013247}}</ref><ref>Kraus (1994), p. 30</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Nicomachean Family of [[Manuscript|MSS]]\n|-\n!

A second family of the first decade consists of the Verona [[Palimpsest]], reconstructed and published by [[Theodore Mommsen]], 1868; hence the Veronensis MSS. It includes 60 leaves of Livy fragments covering Books III-VI. The handwriting style is dated to the 4th century, only a few centuries after Livy.<ref>Foster (1874), p. xxxii.</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages there were constant rumors that the complete books of the History of Livy lay hidden in the library of a Danish or German Monastery. One individual even affirmed under oath in the court of [[Martin V]] that he had seen the whole work, written in Lombardic script, in a monastery in Denmark.

He himself noted the difficulty of finding information about events some 700 years or more removed from the author. Of his material on early Rome he said \"The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or whilst it was being built, are more fitted to adorn the creations of the poet than the authentic records of the historian.\"<ref>Preface.</ref> The first book has been one of the most significant sources of the various accounts of the traditional legend of [[Romulus and Remus]].<ref>* {{cite journal|last=Tennant|first=PMW|date=1988|title=The Lupercalia and the Romulus and Remus Legend|url=http://www.casa-kvsa.org.za/1988/AC31-08-Tennant.pdf|journal=Acta Classica|volume=XXXI|pages=81\u201393|issn=0065-1141|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, according to the tradition of writing history at the time, he felt obliged to relate what he read (or heard) without passing judgment as to its truth or untruth. One of the problems of modern scholarship is to ascertain where in the work the line is to be drawn between legendary and historical. One view has been that buildings, inscriptions, monuments and libraries prior to the [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] in 387 BC by the [[Gauls]] under [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] were destroyed by that sack and were scarcely available to Livy and his sources. This view originates from Livy himself, who notes this fact.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Platner |first1=S.B. |year=1929 |last2=Ashby |first2=T. |title=Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=506\u20138 }}</ref> A layer of ash over the lowest pavement of the [[comitium]] believed to date from that time seemed to confirm a citywide destruction.\n\nA new view by [[Tim Cornell]], however, deemphasizes the damage caused by the Gauls under Brennus. Among other reasons, he asserts that the Gauls' interest in movable plunder, rather than destruction, kept damage to a minimum.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Cornell |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EAEOAAAAQAAJ |title=The Beginnings of Rome |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=318\u2013319 |isbn=978-0-415-01596-7 }}</ref> The burnt layer under the [[comitium]] is now dated to the 6th century BC.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coarelli |first=Filippo |year=1983 |title=Il Foro romano |edition=3 |publisher=Quasar |isbn=978-88-85020-44-3 }}</ref> There apparently is no archaeological evidence of a widespread destruction of Rome by the Gauls. Cornell uses this information to affirm the historicity of Livy's account of the 5th and 4th centuries BC.\n\n==Livy's sources==\nFor the first decade, Livy studied the works of a group of historians in or near his own time, known as [[annalists]]. Some twelve historians in this category are named by Livy in Book I as sources on the period of the monarchy.<ref>Seeley (1881), p. 11.</ref> In date order backward from Livy they are: [[Gaius Licinius Macer]], [[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]], [[Valerius Antias]], [[Gnaeus Gellius]], [[Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus (consul 129 BC)]], [[Lucius Cassius Hemina]], [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133)]], [[Aulus Postumius Albinus (consul 151)]], Gaius Acilius Glabrio, [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus]], [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]. Elsewhere he mentions [[Sempronius Asellio]]. Macer, the latest of these, died in 66. Fabius, the earliest, fought in the Gallic War of 225.\n\nLivy's sources were by no means confined to the annalists. Other historians of his time mention documents then extant dating as far back as the Roman monarchy. These include treaties between [[Servius Tullius]] and the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], between [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] and [[Gabii]], three between Rome and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], and one between Cassius and the Latins, 493, which was engraved in bronze. In addition the [[Pontifex Maximus]] kept the [[Annales Maximi]] (yearly events) on display in his house, the [[Roman censor|censors]] kept the Commentarii Censorum, the [[praetor]]s kept their own records, the [[Commentarii]] [[College of Pontiffs|Pontificum]] and Libri Augurales were available as well as all the laws on stone or brass; the [[fasti]] (list of magistrates) and the [[Linen Rolls|Libri Lintei]], historical records kept in the temple of Juno [[Moneta]].<ref>Seeley (1881), pp. 12\u201314 citing various historians.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the accounts of Rome's early history are for the most part incomplete and therefore suspect (in this view). Seeley argues, \"It is when Livy's account is compared with the accounts of other writers that we become aware of the utter uncertainty which prevailed among the Romans themselves... The traditional history, as a whole, must be rejected...\"<ref>Seeley (1881), p. 17.</ref> As Livy stated that he used what he found without passing judgement on his sources, attacks on the credibility of Livy often begin with the annalists. Opinions vary. T.J. Cornell presumes that Livy relied on \"unscrupulous annalists\" who \"did not hesitate to invent a series of face-saving victories.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=T.J. |year=1986 |work=Past Perspectives: Studies in Greek and Roman Historical Writing |editor-first=I.S. |editor-last=Moxon |page=74 |title=The Formation of the Historical Tradition of Early Rome |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |editor2-last=Smart |editor2-first= J.D. |editor3-first=Anthony John |editor3-last=Woodman}}</ref> Furthermore, he argues, \"The annalists of the first century BC are thus seen principally as entertainers...\" Cornell does not follow this view consistently, as he is willing to accept Livy as history for the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.

Collins defines the \"annalistic method\" as \"naming the public officers and recording the events of each succeeding year\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=William Lucas |year=1876 |title=Livy |pages=13\u201314 |publisher=J.B. Lippincott & Co |location=Philadelphia}}</ref> It is an expansion of the [[fasti]], the official public chronicles kept by the magistrates, which were a primary source for Roman historians. Those who seem to have been more influenced by the method have been termed [[annalists]].\n\nThe first and third decades (see below) of Livy's work are written so well that Livy has become a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of curricula in Golden Age Latin. Some have argued that subsequently the quality of his writing began to decline, and that he becomes repetitious and wordy. Of the 91st book [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] says \"repetitions are here so frequent in the small compass of four pages and the prolixity so great, that we should hardly believe it to belong to Livy....\" Niebuhr accounts for the decline by supposing \"the writer has grown old and become loquacious...\", going so far as to conjecture that the later books were lost because copyists refused to copy such low-quality work.<ref>Niebuhr (1844), p. 38.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=Which tome exactly? Niebuhr's works are online, please add a link to the book.}}\n\nA [[digression]] in Book 9, Sections 17\u201319, suggests that the Romans would have beaten [[Alexander the Great]] if he had lived longer and had turned west to attack the Romans, making this digression the oldest known [[alternate history]].<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-last=Dozois |editor1-first=Gardner |editor1-link=Gardner Dozois |year=1998 |editor2-last=Schmidt |editor2-first=Stanley |title=Roads Not Taken: Tales of Alternate History |publisher=Del Rey |location=New York |pages=1\u20135 |isbn=978-0-345-42194-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Livy's publication==\n[[File:Ab Urbe condita.tif|thumb|''Ab Urbe condita'', 1714]]\nThe first five books were published between 27 and 25 BC. The first date mentioned is the year [[Augustus]] received that title: twice in the first five books Livy uses it.<ref>Foster (1874), p. xi, citing Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|I.19]] and [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 4#20|IV.20]].</ref> For the second date, Livy lists the closings of the temple of [[Janus]] but omits that of 25 (it had not happened yet).<ref>Foster (1874), p. xi, citing Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#19|I.19]].</ref>\n\nLivy continued to work on the ''History'' for much of the rest of his life, publishing new material by popular demand. This explains why the work falls naturally into 12 packets, mainly groups of 10 books, or decades, sometimes of 5 books (pentads or {{proper name|pentades}}) and the rest without any packet order. The scheme of dividing it entirely into decades is a later innovation of copyists.<ref>Foster (1874), pp xv\u2013xvi.</ref>\n\nThe second pentad did not come out until 9 or after, some 16 years after the first pentad. In Book IX Livy states that the [[Silva Ciminia|Cimminian Forest]] was more impassable than the German had been recently, referring to the [[Hercynian Forest]] (Black Forest) first opened by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Ahenobarbus]].<ref>Niebuhr (1844), p. 39, citing [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 10#36|Livy IX.36]].</ref> One can only presume that in the interval Livy's first pentad had been such a success that he had to yield to the demand for more.\n\n==Manuscripts==\nThere is no uniform system of classifying and naming manuscripts. Often the relationship of one [[manuscript]] (MS) to another remains unknown or changes as perceptions of the handwriting change. Livy's release of chapters by packet diachronically encouraged copyists to copy by decade. Each decade has its own conventions, which do not necessarily respect the conventions of any other decade. A family of MSS descend through copying from the same MSS (typically lost). MSS vary widely; to produce an emendation or a printed edition was and is a major task. Usually variant readings are given in footnotes.\n\n===First decade===\nAll of the manuscripts (except one) of the first ten books (first decade) of ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'', which were copied through the Middle Ages and were used in the first printed editions, are derived from a single [[recension]] commissioned by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], consul, AD 391.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hedrick | first=Charles W. |year=2000 |title=History and Silence: Purge and Rehabilitation of Memory in Late Antiquity |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73121-9 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref> A recension is made by comparing extant manuscripts and producing a new version, an [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]], based on the text that seems best to the editor. The latter then \"subscribed\" to the new MS by noting on it that he had emended it.\n\nSymmachus, probably using the authority of his office, commissioned Tascius Victorianus to emend the first decade. Books I\u2013IX bear the subscription ''Victorianus emendabam dominis Symmachis'', \"I Victorianus emended (this) by the authority of Symmachus.\" Books VI\u2013VIII include another subscription preceding it, that of Symmachus' son-in-law, [[Nicomachus Flavianus (son)|Nicomachus Flavianus]], and Books III\u2013V were also emended by Flavianus' son, [[Appius Nicomachus Dexter]], who says he used his relative Clementianus' copy.<ref name=\"foster32-36\">Foster (1874), pp. xxxii\u2013xxxvi</ref> This recension and family of descendant MSS is called the Nicomachean, after two of the subscribers. From it several MSS descend (incomplete list):<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hall |first=Frederick William |year=1913 |title=A companion to classical texts |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=246\u2013247}}</ref><ref>Kraus (1994), p. 30</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Nicomachean Family of [[Manuscript|MSS]]\n|-\n!

A second family of the first decade consists of the Verona [[Palimpsest]], reconstructed and published by [[Theodore Mommsen]], 1868; hence the Veronensis MSS. It includes 60 leaves of Livy fragments covering Books III-VI. The handwriting style is dated to the 4th century, only a few centuries after Livy.<ref>Foster (1874), p. xxxii.</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages there were constant rumors that the complete books of the History of Livy lay hidden in the library of a Danish or German Monastery. One individual even affirmed under oath in the court of [[Martin V]] that he had seen the whole work, written in Lombardic script, in a monastery in Denmark. All of these rumors were later found to be unsubstantiated.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/clark_reappearance.htm | title=Clark, A.C., the Reappearance of the texts of the Classics, Oxford, 1921}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nThe details of Livy's ''History of Rome'' vary from arguably legendary or perhaps even mythical stories at the beginning to detailed accounts of certainly real events toward the end. He himself noted the difficulty of finding information about events some 700 years or more removed from the author. Of his material on early Rome he said \"The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or whilst it was being built, are more fitted to adorn the creations of the poet than the authentic records of the historian.\"<ref>Preface.</ref> The first book has been one of the most significant sources of the various accounts of the traditional legend of [[Romulus and Remus]].<ref>* {{cite journal|last=Tennant|first=PMW|date=1988|title=The Lupercalia and the Romulus and Remus Legend|url=http://www.casa-kvsa.org.za/1988/AC31-08-Tennant.pdf|journal=Acta Classica|volume=XXXI|pages=81\u201393|issn=0065-1141|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, according to the tradition of writing history at the time, he felt obliged to relate what he read (or heard) without passing judgment as to its truth or untruth. One of the problems of modern scholarship is to ascertain where in the work the line is to be drawn between legendary and historical. One view has been that buildings, inscriptions, monuments and libraries prior to the [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] in 387 BC by the [[Gauls]] under [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] were destroyed by that sack and were scarcely available to Livy and his sources. This view originates from Livy himself, who notes this fact.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Platner |first1=S.B. |year=1929 |last2=Ashby |first2=T. |title=Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=506\u20138 }}</ref> A layer of ash over the lowest pavement of the [[comitium]] believed to date from that time seemed to confirm a citywide destruction.\n\nA new view by [[Tim Cornell]], however, deemphasizes the damage caused by the Gauls under Brennus. Among other reasons, he asserts that the Gauls' interest in movable plunder, rather than destruction, kept damage to a minimum.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Cornell |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EAEOAAAAQAAJ |title=The Beginnings of Rome |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=318\u2013319 |isbn=978-0-415-01596-7 }}</ref> The burnt layer under the [[comitium]] is now dated to the 6th century BC.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coarelli |first=Filippo |year=1983 |title=Il Foro romano |edition=3 |publisher=Quasar |isbn=978-88-85020-44-3 }}</ref> There apparently is no archaeological evidence of a widespread destruction of Rome by the Gauls. Cornell uses this information to affirm the historicity of Livy's account of the 5th and 4th centuries BC.\n\n==Livy's sources==\nFor the first decade, Livy studied the works of a group of historians in or near his own time, known as [[annalists]]. Some twelve historians in this category are named by Livy in Book I as sources on the period of the monarchy.<ref>Seeley (1881), p. 11.</ref> In date order backward from Livy they are: [[Gaius Licinius Macer]], [[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]], [[Valerius Antias]], [[Gnaeus Gellius]], [[Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus (consul 129 BC)]], [[Lucius Cassius Hemina]], [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133)]], [[Aulus Postumius Albinus (consul 151)]], Gaius Acilius Glabrio, [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus]], [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]. Elsewhere he mentions [[Sempronius Asellio]]. Macer, the latest of these, died in 66. Fabius, the earliest, fought in the Gallic War of 225.\n\nLivy's sources were by no means confined to the annalists. Other historians of his time mention documents then extant dating as far back as the Roman monarchy. These include treaties between [[Servius Tullius]] and the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], between [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] and [[Gabii]], three between Rome and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], and one between Cassius and the Latins, 493, which was engraved in bronze. In addition the [[Pontifex Maximus]] kept the [[Annales Maximi]] (yearly events) on display in his house, the [[Roman censor|censors]] kept the Commentarii Censorum, the [[praetor]]s kept their own records, the [[Commentarii]] [[College of Pontiffs|Pontificum]] and Libri Augurales were available as well as all the laws on stone or brass; the [[fasti]] (list of magistrates) and the [[Linen Rolls|Libri Lintei]], historical records kept in the temple of Juno [[Moneta]].<ref>Seeley (1881), pp. 12\u201314 citing various historians.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the accounts of Rome's early history are for the most part incomplete and therefore suspect (in this view). Seeley argues, \"It is when Livy's account is compared with the accounts of other writers that we become aware of the utter uncertainty which prevailed among the Romans themselves... The traditional history, as a whole, must be rejected...\"<ref>Seeley (1881), p. 17.</ref> As Livy stated that he used what he found without passing judgement on his sources, attacks on the credibility of Livy often begin with the annalists. Opinions vary. T.J. Cornell presumes that Livy relied on \"unscrupulous annalists\" who \"did not hesitate to invent a series of face-saving victories.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=T.J. |year=1986 |work=Past Perspectives: Studies in Greek and Roman Historical Writing |editor-first=I.S. |editor-last=Moxon |page=74 |title=The Formation of the Historical Tradition of Early Rome |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |editor2-last=Smart |editor2-first= J.D. |editor3-first=Anthony John |editor3-last=Woodman}}</ref> Furthermore, he argues, \"The annalists of the first century BC are thus seen principally as entertainers...\" Cornell does not follow this view consistently, as he is willing to accept Livy as history for the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. A more positive view of the same limitations was given by Howard:<ref name=howard>{{Cite journal |last=Howard |first=Albert A. |year=1906 |title=Valerius Antias and Livy |journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |volume=18 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University |pages=161\u2013182 |doi=10.2307/310316|jstor=310316 }}</ref><blockquote>The annalists were not modern historians, and not one of them is absolutely free from the faults attributed to Antias. That any of them, even Antias, deliberately falsified history is extremely improbable, but they were nearly all strong partisans, and of two conflicting stories it was most natural for them to choose the one which was most flattering to the Romans, or even to their own political party, and, as the principle of historical writing even in the time of Quintilian was stated to be that history was closely akin to poetry and was written to tell a story, not to prove it, we may safely assume that all writers were prone to choose the account which was most interesting and which required the least work in verification.</blockquote>\n\nFor the third decade, Livy followed the account of the Greek historian [[Polybius]], as did the historical accounts of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=William |year=1878 |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Anthon |title=Polybius |encyclopedia=A new classical dictionary of Greek and Roman biography, mythology and geography |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |location=New York}}</ref> Polybius had access to Greek sources in the eastern Mediterranean, outside the local Roman traditions.\n\n==Machiavelli and Livy==\n[[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s work on [[republic]]s, the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', is presented as a commentary on the ''History of Rome''.\n\n==Translations==\nThe first complete rendering of ''Ab Urbe Condita'' into English was [[Philemon Holland]]'s translation published in 1600. According to Considine, 'it was a work of great importance, presented in a grand folio volume of 1458 pages, and dedicated to the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]]'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Considine|2004}}.</ref>\n\nThe authoritative translation of ''The History of Early Rome'' was made by B.O.
