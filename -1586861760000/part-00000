Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] (see {{usc|39|202}}). The nine appointed members then select the [[United States Postmaster General|United States postmaster general]], who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as chief executive officer (see {{usc|39|202|203}}). The ten-member board then nominates a deputy postmaster general, who acts as chief operating officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat.\n\nThe independent [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the President confirmed by the Senate. It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals.\n\nThe USPS is often mistaken for a [[government-owned corporation]] (e.g., [[Amtrak]]) because it operates much like a business. It is, however, an \"establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States\", ({{usc|39|201}}) as it is controlled by presidential appointees and the postmaster general. As a [[government agency]], it has many special privileges, including [[sovereign immunity]], [[eminent domain]] powers, powers to negotiate [[Universal Postal Union|postal treaties]] with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail. Indeed, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the USPS was not a government-owned corporation, and therefore could not be sued under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref>''United States Postal Serv. v.

While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's [[universal service obligation]] (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a ''legal obligation'' to provide all the various aspects of universal service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|title=Mission statement|website=about.usps.com|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412172323/https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|archive-date=2019-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the [[Private Express Statutes]] (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|title=Report On Universal Postal Service and The Postal Monopoly|website=|publisher=USPS|access-date=28 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219020753/http://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service.

The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report<ref>[http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm USPS.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623183803/http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm |date=June 23, 2011 }}. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.\n\nObligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly \"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly\". Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:\n\n<blockquote>It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \"monopoly,\" because the enforcement of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1725}} leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. </blockquote>\n\nMost of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and many other [[Metropolis|major metros]] one must get a background check from [[police]] and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post [[Advertising|commercial]] messages on [[private property]].\n\nRegarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either ''the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the \"base rate\" or \"base tariff\")'' or ''the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.''\n\nThe Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly.

However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.<ref name=\"smartpost\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost\u00ae Shipping & Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405161604/http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"mailinno\">{{cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations \u2013 Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114221/http://upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | archive-date=May 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept.

To the extent that people make choices about where they live, they should assume the costs of that decision.\n* Third, there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to ensure service to sparsely populated areas. The government could easily award competitive contracts to private firms for that service.\n* Fourth, early concerns that rural residents of the United States would somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are simply unfounded. ...

Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps.\n\n====PC Postage====\n\nIn addition to using standard stamps, postage can now be printed in the form of an electronic stamp, or e-stamp, from a personal computer using a system called [[Information Based Indicia]]. This online PC Postage method relies upon application software on the customer's computer contacting a postal security device at the office of the postal service.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | first=Henk C.

As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the [[Advanced Facer-Canceler System]] (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines.\n\nIn contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] (stamp or metered [[postage]] mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a [[postmark]]. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.\n\nMail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a [[bar code]] and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes.\n\nMail with typed addresses goes to a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader]] (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the [[Remote Bar Coding System]]. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.\n\nWhen it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called [[Remote Encoding Center]]s, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a [[fluorescent]] [[barcode]] printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.\n\nProcessed mail is imaged by the [[Mail Isolation Control and Tracking]] (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days.<ref name=\"WaPo_confirm\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Miga |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-postal-takes-photos-mail-keeps-images-074323981.html |publisher=Yahoo!

If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.\n\nMail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the [[dead letter office]]). At this office, the mail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service.\n\nOnce the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a [[delivery bar code sorter|Delivery Bar Code Sorter]] (DBCS) that reads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it to an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey.\n\nRegional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local post offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual mail carrier.\n\nAt the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted;<ref name=\"bard\" /> the remaining mail must be sorted by hand.

They are divided into two categories: '''City Letter Carriers''', who are represented by the NALC, and '''[[Rural Letter Carrier]]s''', who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70&nbsp;lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday.\n* '''Rural carriers''' are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.\n* '''Mail handlers and processors''', prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.\n* '''Clerks''', have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.\n\nOther non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n* '''Maintenance and custodians''', who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.\n* '''City Carrier Assistants'''. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \"relative standing\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.\n* '''Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees''' (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or mail carriers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | publisher=APWU | title=IT/ASC & OS Employees | accessdate=2016-04-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212072133/https://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | archive-date=2016-02-12 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*'''Contractors''' are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors.\n\nThough the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement.

The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the character \"Kris Kringle\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus.

Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] (see {{usc|39|202}}). The nine appointed members then select the [[United States Postmaster General|United States postmaster general]], who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as chief executive officer (see {{usc|39|202|203}}). The ten-member board then nominates a deputy postmaster general, who acts as chief operating officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat.\n\nThe independent [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the President confirmed by the Senate. It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals.\n\nThe USPS is often mistaken for a [[government-owned corporation]] (e.g., [[Amtrak]]) because it operates much like a business. It is, however, an \"establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States\", ({{usc|39|201}}) as it is controlled by presidential appointees and the postmaster general. As a [[government agency]], it has many special privileges, including [[sovereign immunity]], [[eminent domain]] powers, powers to negotiate [[Universal Postal Union|postal treaties]] with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail. Indeed, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the USPS was not a government-owned corporation, and therefore could not be sued under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref>''United States Postal Serv. v.

While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's [[universal service obligation]] (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a ''legal obligation'' to provide all the various aspects of universal service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|title=Mission statement|website=about.usps.com|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412172323/https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|archive-date=2019-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the [[Private Express Statutes]] (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|title=Report On Universal Postal Service and The Postal Monopoly|website=|publisher=USPS|access-date=28 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219020753/http://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service.

The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report<ref>[http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm USPS.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623183803/http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm |date=June 23, 2011 }}. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.\n\nObligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly \"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly\". Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:\n\n<blockquote>It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \"monopoly,\" because the enforcement of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1725}} leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. </blockquote>\n\nMost of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and many other [[Metropolis|major metros]] one must get a background check from [[police]] and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post [[Advertising|commercial]] messages on [[private property]].\n\nRegarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either ''the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the \"base rate\" or \"base tariff\")'' or ''the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.''\n\nThe Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. \"A more rigidly defined USO would  ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses,\" according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.\n\n===Competitors===\n[[File:U.S. Post Office - Los Angeles Terminal Annex.jpg|thumb|USPS [[Terminal Annex]] building in Los Angeles]]\n\n[[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) directly compete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages. Due to the postal monopoly, they are not allowed to deliver non-urgent letters and may not directly ship to U.S. Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations. However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.<ref name=\"smartpost\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost\u00ae Shipping & Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405161604/http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"mailinno\">{{cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations \u2013 Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114221/http://upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | archive-date=May 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept.

Also known as [[E-COM]],  it too was used for bulk mailings. Text was transmitted electronically to one of 25 post offices nationwide.

To the extent that people make choices about where they live, they should assume the costs of that decision.\n* Third, there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to ensure service to sparsely populated areas. The government could easily award competitive contracts to private firms for that service.\n* Fourth, early concerns that rural residents of the United States would somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are simply unfounded. ...

Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps.\n\n====PC Postage====\n\nIn addition to using standard stamps, postage can now be printed in the form of an electronic stamp, or e-stamp, from a personal computer using a system called [[Information Based Indicia]]. This online PC Postage method relies upon application software on the customer's computer contacting a postal security device at the office of the postal service.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | first=Henk C.

As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the [[Advanced Facer-Canceler System]] (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines.\n\nIn contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] (stamp or metered [[postage]] mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a [[postmark]]. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.\n\nMail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a [[bar code]] and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes.\n\nMail with typed addresses goes to a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader]] (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the [[Remote Bar Coding System]]. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.\n\nWhen it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called [[Remote Encoding Center]]s, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a [[fluorescent]] [[barcode]] printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.\n\nProcessed mail is imaged by the [[Mail Isolation Control and Tracking]] (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days.<ref name=\"WaPo_confirm\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Miga |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-postal-takes-photos-mail-keeps-images-074323981.html |publisher=Yahoo!

If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.\n\nMail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the [[dead letter office]]). At this office, the mail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service.\n\nOnce the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a [[delivery bar code sorter|Delivery Bar Code Sorter]] (DBCS) that reads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it to an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey.\n\nRegional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local post offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual mail carrier.\n\nAt the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted;<ref name=\"bard\" /> the remaining mail must be sorted by hand.

They are divided into two categories: '''City Letter Carriers''', who are represented by the NALC, and '''[[Rural Letter Carrier]]s''', who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70&nbsp;lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday.\n* '''Rural carriers''' are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.\n* '''Mail handlers and processors''', prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.\n* '''Clerks''', have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.\n\nOther non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n* '''Maintenance and custodians''', who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.\n* '''City Carrier Assistants'''. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \"relative standing\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.\n* '''Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees''' (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or mail carriers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | publisher=APWU | title=IT/ASC & OS Employees | accessdate=2016-04-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212072133/https://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | archive-date=2016-02-12 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*'''Contractors''' are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors.\n\nThough the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement.

The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the character \"Kris Kringle\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus. Judge Henry X. Harper (played by [[Gene Lockhart]]) ruled that since the U.S. Government had demonstrated through the delivery of the bags of mail that Kris Kringle was Santa Claus, the [[State of New York]] did not have the authority to overrule that decision.\n* The novel ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]'' (1971), written by poet and novelist [[Charles Bukowski]], is a semi-autobiographical account of his life over the years as a mail carrier. Bukowski would, under duress, quit and years later return as a mail clerk. His personal account would detail the work at lengths as frustrating, menial, boring, and degrading.\n* [[David Brin]]'s novel ''[[The Postman]]'' (1985) portrays the USPS and its returned services as a staple to revive the United States government in a post-apocalyptic world. It was [[The Postman (film)|adapted as a film]] starring [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Larenz Tate]] in 1997.\n* The comedy film ''[[Dear God (film)|Dear God]]'' (1996), starring [[Greg Kinnear]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]], portrays a group of quirky postal workers in a [[dead letter office]] that handle letters addressed to the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], and even God himself.\n* In 2015, ''[[The Inspectors (TV series)|The Inspectors]]'', which depicts a group of postal inspectors investigating postal crimes, debuted on [[CBS]].
