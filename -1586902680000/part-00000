In this context, \"Marvel Universe\" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], which is known as '''[[Earth-616]]''' or currently as '''Earth Prime'''.\n\n==History==\n\nThough the concept of a [[shared universe]] was not new or unique to [[comic book]]s in 1961, writer/editor [[Stan Lee]], together with several artists including [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another&mdash;[[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] had been rivals when Marvel was [[Timely Comics]] (Marvel Vault)&mdash; but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share a world.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''. ''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>  The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in [[New York City]]; by contrast, many [[DC Universe|DC heroes]] live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Multiverse]] resembling [[DC multiverse|DC's parallel worlds]]; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap. What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally not affect what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe. However, writers would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Marvel published the miniseries ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat.  This was Marvel's first miniseries.  Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvel's series of reference material, ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', which followed shortly on the heels of ''Contest of Champions''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Concepts==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}\nThe Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world. Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc.), same historical events (such as World War II), and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as [[Wakanda]] and [[Latveria]] (very small nations) and organizations like the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its enemies, [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] In 2009 Marvel officially described its world's geography in a two-part miniseries, the ''Marvel Atlas''.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1787.Travel_The_World_With_The_Marvel_Atlas Travel \"The World With The Marvel Atlas\"]. Marvel.com News</ref><!-- We need a primary source for this!-->\n\nMost importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] concepts, with writers adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe. (A universe incorporating ''all'' these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare; another example is the [[DC Universe]].)  Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe. One such case is [[Fin Fang Foom]] arising from the ashes of tantric magic.  Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, who have gained their powers by any of these means.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nComparatively, little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in \"real-time\". Marvel's major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has (after a prolonged period of being identified as about 10 years in the mid-to-late 1990s) most recently been identified as 13 years.<ref>''The Thing'' #13 (July 2006); ''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref> Consequently, the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years to \"make sense\" in this [[floating timeline]]. Thus, the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years before the publishing date of the current issue. For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s high school graduation was published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September 1965), his college graduation in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #185 (October 1978), and his high school reunion in ''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7 (December 2004). Because of the floating timeline, where stories refer to real-life historic events, these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities; for instance, the origin of [[Iron Man]] was changed in a 2004 storyline to refer to the [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]],<ref>'' Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #1 (November 2004)</ref> whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Vietnam]]; similarly, [[The Punisher]]'s backstory has also been changed as well.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, ([[Captain America]]'s [[alter ego]]), have worked for Marvel.{{issue|date=September 2014}} The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes (except for details not known to the public, like their secret identities); many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves, who customarily donate their share of profits to charity. Additionally, the [[DC Comics]] Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said concerning the DC Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nPop culture characters such as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] exist in the Marvel Universe. This is usually justified as a second-hand account of events as told to credited authors [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]], although the general public continues to believe them to be fictional. [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Kull (comics)|Kull the Conqueror]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]] also have real-life existences in the Marvel Universe. The [[Hyborian Era]] of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth-616 pre-recorded history. However, they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters.  This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howard's works before 2006 when they became public domain. As of 2019, Conan the Barbarian, as well as Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane, have been firmly integrated, thanks to Marvel regaining the publishing rights to the characters. Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], the [[Transformers (franchise)|Transformers]], the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (in the character of [[Machine Man]]), [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom the Spaceknight]], the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]], and the [[Shogun Warriors (comics)|Shogun Warriors]]. In most cases, such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid copyright infringement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Costumed superheroes and supervillains===\nWithin the fictional history of the Marvel Universe, the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed, but it came into prominence during the days of the American \"[[Wild West]]\" with heroes such as [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade/the Phantom Rider]]. During the 20th century, the tradition was reinvigorated by [[Captain America|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] and the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in the 1940s, who fought for the [[Allies of World War II]].\n\nMarvel's most prominent heroes were created during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in the 1960s to early 1970s, including [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark/Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner/the Hulk]], [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock/Daredevil]],

[[Rogue (comics)|Anna Marie LeBeau/Rogue]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilation Lee/Jubilee]].\n\nSome of Marvel's more recent creations from the mid-to-late 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, such as [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson/Deadpool]], [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau/Gambit]], [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers/Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Neena Thurman/Domino]], [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Fong/Blink]], the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], [[Yelena Belova]] (also known as the second Black Widow), the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the modern [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the modern [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (based off [[The Defenders (miniseries)|the Netflix MCU version of the same name]]), [[X-23|Laura Kinney/X-23]] (a.k.a. the second Wolverine), [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]], the [[Dora Milaje]], [[Daisy Johnson]] (also known as Quake), [[Phil Coulson]], [[Melinda May]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier]], [[Maria Hill]], [[Miles Morales]] (the second Spider-Man of the Ultimate Marvel Universe), [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]] (also known as the Red Queen and the second Wasp), [[Cassandra Lang]] (also known as Stature, Stinger, Ant-Girl and Giant-Girl), the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], [[Amadeus Cho]] (also known as the second Hulk), [[Kamala Khan]] (also known as the second Ms. Marvel), [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] (also known as the third Hawkeye), [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunaella Lafayette/Moon Girl]], [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] (also known as the second Miss America), [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] (also known as the fourth Ghost Rider), [[Ironheart (character)|Riri Williams/Ironheart]] and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] ([[Gwen Stacy]] of Earth-65) have become popular characters in their own right. Unlike the [[DC Universe]], few of Marvel's 1940s characters have risen to prominence in modern publications; [[Captain America]] is one exception, and to a lesser extent, his contemporary, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and the Marvel Universe during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nProminent teams of superheroes include the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Inhumans]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Howling Commandos]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the [[Midnight Sons]] and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All these groups have varying lineups; the Avengers have included Marvel's major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men are a team of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] led by [[Professor X]] and include many of Marvel's most popular characters, such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and others. The Fantastic Four are viewed as \"Marvel's First Family\" of superheroes, usually consisting of [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as well as siblings [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards]]. The Defenders were an ad-hoc team usually brought together by [[Doctor Strange]] which has included the [[Hulk]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]], while the most recent incarnation of the team consists of street-level New York City heroes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. The Guardians of the Galaxy include Marvel's cosmic characters such as [[Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Groot]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]], but the team has also introduced other heroes into the roster such as [[Kitty Pryde]], the Silver Surfer, the Thing and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. The Inhumans are a royal family comprising of [[Black Bolt]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Crystal]], [[Gorgon]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Karnak|Karnak the Shatterer]] and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], who rule the city of Attilan. The Runaways are a group of teenagers and a dinosaur consisting of [[Alex Wilder]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Gert Yorkes]] and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] who rebel against their evil parents known as [[The Pride (comics)|the Pride]]. The Midnight Sons consist of supernatural heroes such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstrom]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]] and the [[Man-Thing]]. The Thunderbolts' original incarnation were supervillains disguised as superheroes consisting of [[Citizen V]] (a.k.a. [[Helmut Zemo]]), [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] (a.k.a. the Beetle), [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] (a.k.a. Screaming Mimi), [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] (a.k.a. Meteorite), [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno/the Ogre]] (a.k.a. the Fixer) and [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], while the current incarnation of the team is made up of reformed supervillains working for the government: [[Deadpool]], the [[Punisher]], the [[Red Hulk]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Although teams of supervillains are few and far between, notable examples include the [[Masters of Evil]], the [[Emissaries of Evil]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Frightful Four]], the [[Lethal Legion]], the [[Legion of the Unliving]], the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], the [[Annihilation Wave]], the [[Starforce]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]].\n\n===Origin of superhuman powers===\nMost of the superhumans in Marvel's Earth owe their powers to the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our [[prehistoric]] ancestors (a process they also carried out on several other planets). This resulted in the creation of two [[Hidden races (Marvel Comics)|hidden races]], the godlike [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] and the genetically unstable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], in addition to giving some humans an \"x-factor\" in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s. Others require other factors (such as [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]]) for their powers to come forth. Depending on the genetic profile, individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury, while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest. Except for [[psionic]] abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have the same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanity's evolution. A Marvel series titled ''[[Earth X]]'' explored one possible reason for this: that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside Earth against any planetary threats and have done so for eons. An X-Men villain that is known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be a new direction in human evolution, as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being. The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nOther possible origins for superhuman powers include [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and/or [[Bionics|bionic]] implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius-level intelligence, such as Reed Richards ([[Mister Fantastic]]) of the Fantastic Four. However, most of the advanced devices (such as [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] and [[death ray]]s) are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. One major company producing these devices is Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or [[time travel]]ers like [[Kang the Conqueror]], who is known to have influenced the [[robotics]] industry in the past.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn superhumans, the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source or, if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver, comes from another source. In most cases, this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field (UPF), which they can tap into. Sometimes they are connected to another source, and more rarely they are even a host for it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMarvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources \"scientifically\", usually through the use of fictional science-like concepts, such as:\n* Energy absorption (the battery effect); the cells in the body have the same function as batteries, being charged with energy that comes from an outer source. This is most often seen in gamma ray-exposed individuals such as the Hulk, who get their powers from this stored energy. The powers will remain as long as the energy is present, and can even be increased by filling the \"batteries\" even more. If the energy is emptied, the powers will fade away.\n* The [[Power Primordial]] is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the [[Elders of the Universe]].\n* The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] is a force of incredible power. It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[telepaths]] like [[Jean Grey]].\n* Psionic energy, which is assumed to be an invisible, unknown form of energy generated by living brains that can manipulate other forms of matter and energy.\n* The universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe, but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy.\n* The Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse and is also the source of its counterpart on Earth the Uni-Power, which transforms an individual into Captain Universe.\n* Extradimensional space: dimensions that can be tapped to pull mass from them (to add to objects on Earth) or taken away from those objects and be stored in those \"pocket dimensions\" to be retrieved later. This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass. A type of subatomic particles called Pym particles can be used for these effects (Note: many giant-sized characters have a limited ability to manipulate gravity to handle their increased weight). The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead, allowing a character to become harder or [[incorporeal]]. Some characters can seem to \"transform\" themselves (or others) into unliving substances, or even pure energy, by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension, while their souls remain on Earth, controlling their new body. Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to \"[[Teleportation|teleport]]\" by re-entering the Earth dimension at a different point.\n* The [[Darkforce]] is an unknown, dark substance from another dimension (known simply as the [[Darkforce Dimension]]) that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways: to create impenetrable darkness, to solidify it in various forms, and (most notably) to absorb the \"life energy\" from living beings (not all users can use all these effects). The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension, but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers. Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it.  Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers, including [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], the first [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] and [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]] (of the [[Squadron Supreme]] Universe). Cloak seems to be the prime 'portal' to the Darkforce, however.\n* The [[Lightforce]] is the opposite of the Darkforce: a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its dimension, but has healing effects on living beings (except ones made of darkness or the Darkforce). It is unknown if it might be sentient. Cloak's partner, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] seems to be the Lightforce's main [[avatar]].\n* The [[Power Cosmic]] is a force that can alter reality, allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants (including bending the laws of physics), only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time. It seems to be part of the universe itself and is most prominently used by [[Galactus]] and his [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds]].\n* Magic also appears to be like a form of energy, except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally, and usually overrules ordinary science. However, it does have rules of its own to follow, which vary with the method of invocation, usually in the form of spoken spells. It appears to be present in everything, even living beings. All humans in the Marvel Universe can use magic, but only if properly trained. Most people are unaware that magic works. Also, powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific, extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used (often indiscriminately) by those [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s who invoke their names; one example is the trinity of beings called the Vishanti, who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers. At any given time, there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extra-dimensional mystical invaders; this sorcerer is known as the [[Sorcerer Supreme]], an office left empty since the death of [[Brother Voodoo]], but most recently has been reinstated to [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #34 (November 2012)</ref> Stars in the Marvel Universe are sentient beings, and the source of all mystic energy.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #24 (August 1977)</ref>\n* Pym particles are what make people shrink and grow.\n\n===Nonhuman===\nA degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a species or even a subspecies of humans (''Homo superior'' or ''Homo sapiens superior'') that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans (the X-Men and their affiliated groups), those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance ([[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers, as well as other mutants such as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known as the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] as weapons.  Certain species are regarded as [[Untermensch|subhuman]], like the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities. The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to mutants, Eternals, and Deviants, several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth. These include the [[Inhumans]], another genetically unstable race (like the Deviants, but in their case, it is due to their use of a substance called the \"Terrigen Mists\") that was created by a [[Kree]] experiment long ago; the [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterraneans]], a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface, created by the Deviants (some Subterraneans were transformed into the 'Lava Men' by a demon); and ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', a [[humanoid]] species of water-breathers that live in Earth's oceans. Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times. More variants of humanity can be found in the [[Savage Land]] (see Places below). Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape-men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments and whose influence is present in all modern ''Homo sapiens''. Other leftovers from the era when primitive humanoids walked on Earth still exist, such as the radiation-altered [[Neanderthal]] man known as the [[Missing Link (comics)|Missing Link]], an enemy of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #105-106</ref>\n\n===Alien races===\n{{Main|List of alien races in Marvel Comics}}\nThe Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races. Earth has interacted with many of them because a major \"[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] warp\" happens to exist in the [[Solar System]].\n\nThe three major space empires are:\n* the [[Kree]], who rule the Kree Empire (in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]])\n* the [[Skrull]]s, who rule the Skrull Empire (in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]])\n* the [[Shi'ar]], who rule the Shi'ar Empire (no known real-world counterpart for its galaxy, but it might be in the [[Triangulum Galaxy]]<ref>Triangulum is the third-largest galaxy of the Local Group and located more or less between the two main members of the group, Andromeda and the Milky Way.</ref>)\nThe three are often in direct or indirect conflict, which occasionally involves Earth humans; in particular, the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies, and the [[Kree-Skrull War]] has involved humans on several occasions.\n\nThe Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians, who live on a milky planet named Majesdane.<ref name=\" Vol2#8\">'' Runaways'' (vol. 2) #8</ref> The war between the two had started after two Majesdanians, Frank and Leslie Dean of [[Pride (comics)|the Pride]] had been kicked out for criminal activities; the two traveled to Earth, where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane, which was hidden behind the corona of a [[white dwarf]]. The war had gone on for 16 years minimum; it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane, who retaliated.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/>\n\nAnother prominent alien race is the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events, though the Watcher assigned to Earth, [[Uatu]], has violated this oath on several occasions.\n\nThe [[Elders of the Universe]] are ancient aliens who have often had a great impact on many worlds for billions of years, acting alone or as a group. A power called the Power Primordial is channeled through them.\n\nMany other races exist and have formed an \"Intergalactic Council\" to have their say on matters that affect them all, such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs.\n\n===Supernatural creatures===\nAlso abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] and [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]. The 'gods' of most [[polytheistic]] pantheons are powerful, immortal human-like races residing in other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times, and became the basis of many legends. However, all of these 'gods' share a common ancestry and connection to Earth due to [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], the primeval Elder Goddess that infused her life essence into all living things on Earth. Gaea is known by various names and appearances in other cultures and among the various pantheons, but she is the same being. As a result, she is a member of every polytheistic pantheon of 'gods' worshiped by humans. Besides mythological gods, many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well, such as the Dark Gods, enemies of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The Dark Gods are a race of 'gods' that have been worshiped by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] races. Well-known alien races like the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]]s also have beings they worship as 'gods', though little has been revealed about them.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from [[Judeo-Christian]] beliefs have turned out to be the real article, although several angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real-world religious belief. Similarly, [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe. Some of the most powerful are [[Blackheart]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], [[Satannish]], [[Thog (comics)|Thog the Nether-Spawn]] and [[Zom]]. There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as the Vishanti; or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic, such as [[Dormammu]] and [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|the Octessence]], or ones heavily drawing upon the mythologies of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]]. Some supernatural beings, entities and human characters created by Lovecraft and Howard, who were friends and influenced each other's work, have been adapted by Marvel and include [[Abdul Alhazred]],<ref>''Tarzan'' #15 (August 1978)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62 (November 1990)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #152 (April 1994)</ref> [[Conan the Barbarian]]<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #1 (July 1971)</ref> [[Nyarlathotep]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' (vol. 2) #4 (June 1973)</ref> and [[Father Set|Set]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 (May 1976)</ref> Some deities or demonic beings that are original characters of Marvel have been heavily influenced by these mythologies, such as [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #10 (September 1973)</ref>\n\nMost of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]]. The two most featured pantheons are the [[Norse mythology|Asgardians]] (of whom [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is a member) and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] (of whom [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is a member). The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as either the Council of Godheads or the Council of Skyfathers. The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity (at least openly) a thousand years ago by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and most people today believe them to be fictional. Other pantheons have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that is still actively worshiped in the real world, including those worshiped by the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] inhabitants of [[Australia]], the [[Hindu deities|gods]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Shinto]] gods and the gods of [[Zoroastrianism]]. These deities are rarely depicted, however. One such appearance generated a good deal of controversy as the depiction involved a fight between [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's incarnation of Thor]] and the Hindu god [[Shiva]], a battle which Shiva lost.<ref>''Thor'' #301 (November 1980)</ref> As Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hindu religion, his defeat offended some followers of Hinduism. This battle was [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned later as having been the deity [[Indra]], the Hindu god of thunder, who was posing as Shiva, that met defeat.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> To avoid offending the believers of still active religions, Marvel features such deities as characters in the background or who make very brief cameo appearances.\n\nMarvel's depiction of vampires has been heavily influenced by various interpretations of popular media, such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''. As with many other supernatural creatures, Marvel entwined the origin of vampires with aspects of the mythologies created by Lovecraft and Howard. They were created by magical rites performed by priests of Atlantis before the Great Cataclysm that destroyed much of the world, with [[Varnae]] becoming the first vampire. Marvel would depict vampires as frequent antagonists during the [[Hyborian Age]] to Howard characters such as [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] and Conan. In recent years, Marvel's depiction of vampires has altered greatly by creating various subspecies of vampires that exist in [[clan]]s that greatly differ in appearance and belief. All vampires are depicted with varying degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and accelerated healing. Many are capable of transforming into animals such as bats or wolves; some can transform into a mist-like substance; some of the most powerful are capable of controlling the weather to a somewhat limited degree. All vampires must ingest blood to maintain their survival and physical vitality. So long as they do so regularly, they cease to age and are immune to diseases. They retain the well-known vulnerabilities common to vampires in other media interpretations, including sunlight, garlic, religious icons and weapons made of silver. Vampires can be killed by a wooden stake driven through the heart, though they return to life if the stake is removed. Vampires are highly allergic to silver and can be killed with it. While they normally heal rapidly, injuries inflicted by silver weapons heal at a much slower rate if the injuries are not fatal. Vampires can also be killed by decapitation or being burned with fire, with burning them to ashes and then scattering the ashes being the most effective means of ensuring their demise (scattering the ashes is done so that the vampire cannot be mystically resurrected).\n\n===Cosmic entities===\nThe [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] are beings of unbelievably great levels of power (the weakest of whom can destroy entire planets) who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe. Most do not care at all about \"lesser beings\" such as humans, and as a consequence, their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals. When dire threats threaten the universe, it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat and even act on it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMost conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their essential function or to keep the balance with an opposing force. However, certain cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], or the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] have demonstrated personality, motivations, or (except for the first one mentioned) even ambitions beyond their functions, but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative, or that destroying civilizations of \"lesser\" beings is no eviler than if these beings destroyed an anthill. Others such as [[Uatu the Watcher]], [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], or the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] [[Ashema the Listener|Ashema]] and [[Dreaming Celestial|Tiamut]] are aberrations in the sense of sympathizing with, and occasionally coming to the defense of, humanity.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe \"'''Fulcrum'''\" is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy, that \"all\" cosmic entities allegedly serve, of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials. Unlike most other entities, it is capable of conscience, compassion, and even a sense of humor, and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well. He is a possible manifestation/[[avatar]] of the [[One Above All]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] first received personification in [[Jean Grey]]. The Phoenix Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings' past, present, and future, and is an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through \"burning away what doesn't work\", and helped to restart the universe before the [[Big Bang]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Cosmology==\nThe Marvel Universe is part of a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], with various universes coexisting simultaneously, ''usually'' without affecting each other directly.{{issue|date=September 2014}} According to Reed Richards, the ultimate fate of the Multiverse is to perish in all-encompassing heat death.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===Universes/Earths/continuities===\nThe action of most of the Marvel Comics titles takes place in a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] known as [[Earth-616]]. This continuity exists in a [[multiverse]] alongside trillions of alternative continuities.<ref>''Exiles Annual'' #1 (November 2006)</ref> Alternative continuities in the Marvel Multiverse are generally defined in terms of their differences from Earth-616.\n\nContinuities besides Earth-616 include the following (for a complete listing see [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]):\n\n* ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''- an alternate reality ruled by the mutant god [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Designated as '''[[Earth-93060]]'''.\n* ''[[X-Men Adventures]]'' - originally based on the [[X-Men (TV series)|'' X-Men'' animated series]], this universe went on to feature more original stories, and in its final issue revealed itself to be the universe which existed before the current Earth-616 reality, when it was destroyed by the fracturing of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. The current edition of the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' corroborates this.\n* [[Earth-96283]] - an alternate reality in which Spider-Man is the only superhero on Earth. [[Sam Raimi]]'s Spider-Man trilogy takes place here.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-96283|title=Earth-96283|website=Marvel Database|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n* Earth 615 - sometimes being the same universe as [[Earth-616]], and sometimes not.\n* Earth 1218 - The setting of the real world, where supernatural entities don't exist.\n\nIn addition, multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', ''[[What The--?!]]'' (formerly ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'') and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''. The concept of continuity is not the same as a \"dimension\" or a \"universe\"; for example, characters like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Dormammu]] hail from parallel dimensions and [[Galactus]] from the universe that existed before the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth-616 continuity (where all the parallel dimensions and alternate universes seem to be connected to the same main timeline). A continuity should also not be confused with an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]; for example, while the titles of some imprints, such as [[Ultimate Marvel]], take place in a different continuity, some or all publications in other imprints, such as [[Epic Comics]], [[Marvel MAX]], and [[Marvel UK]], take place within the Earth-616 continuity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Dimensions===\nWithin and sometimes ''between'' continuities, there exist a variety of ''dimensions'', sometimes called ''pocket dimensions'', which typically are not depicted as separate continuities, but rather part of one, typically Earth-616. There is a score of such dimensions, ranging from the Earth-like to the alien. Some are magical and others are scientific; some are inhabited and others are not. These include realities like the [[Microverse]], the [[Darkforce|Darkforce Dimension]], [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]], the [[Mojoverse]], and many more. The [[Astral Plane]] is a dimensional plane that is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers. It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess Oshtur that is sometimes referred to as the \"Temple of Oshtur\" or the \"Realm of the Mind\".<ref name=\"ma1\">'' Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot'' one-shot, Marvel Publishing, Inc. 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite various contradictions, the term ''dimension'' is sometimes interchangeable with ''universe'' or ''reality''. Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to [[Earth-616]] characters. Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are not \"pocket dimensions\" as they reside completely ''outside'' the boundaries of the Marvel Universe instead of within, as the former does.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Time===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nOne cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe's history; if a time-traveler should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|divergent universe]] will simply \"branch out\" from the existing timeline, and the time-traveler will still return to his or her unaltered original universe. Those realities can also spawn realities of their own. There exist hundreds, probably thousands of such realities. It is unknown why this happens, though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida Everglades of Earth-616. For the most part, this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently \"born\" from another. However, individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities. These include [[Immortus]], the [[Captain Britain|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[Time Variance Authority]], the [[Timebreaker]]s/[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s forces. It is possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead of altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in [[Marvel 1602]] (it almost destroyed the whole multiverse, including the [[afterlife]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAlso, time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world. Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades, few, if any, have aged to any appreciable degree. For example, the patriotic hero [[Captain America]] was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of [[World War II]]. The character was revived more than 20 years later, explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead, to lead Marvel's latest team of superheroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the company's most famous and most popular. Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or not at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nNaturally, this tendency is purely due to story conveniences (or a somewhat haphazardly shifting patchwork pattern of authors), and mainly that the fictional \"continuity\" has been maintained and expanded far beyond what [[Stan Lee]] and others originally planned or hoped for. Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of [[Spider-Man]]; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], [[Valeria Richards]], [[Power Pack]], or the [[New Mutants]] are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates (in the second case even backward at times), whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all. This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects, as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago, even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved characters would have been toddlers. Different approaches also exist regarding allowing \"second-generation\" descendants of heroes or villains, full-grown over 18 years after an event (for example, [[Hulkling]], other members of the [[Young Avengers]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]), whereas other books, such as ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroic Age|Young Allies]]'' use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims. If a past storyline wherein a direct depiction of a then-current president or similar is referred to in a later era, it tends to become updated accordingly, sometimes with an \"in-joke\" acknowledgment.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA more recent explanation was given by Galactus to the Ultimates, namely that some important events - for instance, the creation of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers -  have a 'gravity' all their own and warp time around them, causing the timeline to subtly change to accommodate this.<ref>''Ultimates'' (2015) #5</ref>\n\n===Space===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nWhile the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the [[Local Group]] is the universe; practically all action takes place in it. The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth, of course, is found, and the Shi\u00b4ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies (perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy); frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers \"in the universe\". Similarly, the Local Group seems to be the only affected area when the [[Annihilation Wave]] cut its bloody swath \"across the universe\".\n\n==Role-playing games==\nFour [[role-playing game]]s have been set in the Marvel Universe:\n\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1984)\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1998)\n* ''[[Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game]]'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 2003)\n* ''[[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]]'' ([[Margaret Weis Productions]], 2012)\n\n==See also==\nFor more complete lists of inhabitants of the Marvel Universe, see [[List of Marvel Comics characters]], [[List of Marvel Comics teams and organizations]], and [[List of Marvel Comics alien races]].\n* [[Features of the Marvel Universe]]\n* [[Publication history of Marvel Comics crossover events]]\n* ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''\n* [[List of Marvel Comics superhero debuts]]\n* [[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|'' Marvel Super Heroes'' (role-playing game)]]\n* [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the official film and TV franchise of all Marvel Comics characters owned by [[Marvel Studios]]/[[Disney]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com Marvel Entertainment] (official site)\n* [http://www.chronologyproject.com Marvel Chronology Project]\n* [http://s15.zetaboards.com/MUA/index/] (Forums named after Marvel Universe)\n\n{{Marvel Comics}}\n{{Marvel Multiverse}}\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Marvel Characters}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Superhero fiction]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics dimensions|Marvel Comics dimensions]]\n[[Category:Canons (fiction)]]\n[[Category:Marvel Entertainment franchises]]\n[[Category:Fictional universes]]\n[[Category:Mythopoeia]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the shared comic book universe|the shared film and TV universe of \n heroes owned by [[Marvel Studios]]/[[Marvel Television]]|Marvel Cinematic Universe|other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{Infobox media franchise\n|title          = {{no italic|Marvel Universe}}\n|italic_title = no\n|image          = Marvel Universe (Civil War).jpg\n|image_upright  =  \n|caption        = Various characters of the Marvel Universe.

Super-teams such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Midnight Sons]], and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Captain America]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Adam Warlock]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], the [[Moon Knight]], the [[Punisher]], [[Deadpool]] and numerous others. It also contains well-known supervillains such as [[Doctor Doom]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[Thanos]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Green Goblin]], [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Red Skull]], [[Ultron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]], [[MODOK]], [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Apocalypse (Marvel Comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Dormammu]], [[Annihilus]] and [[Galactus]].\n\nThe Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a \"[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]\" consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, \"Marvel universes\". In this context, \"Marvel Universe\" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], which is known as '''[[Earth-616]]''' or currently as '''Earth Prime'''.\n\n==History==\n\nThough the concept of a [[shared universe]] was not new or unique to [[comic book]]s in 1961, writer/editor [[Stan Lee]], together with several artists including [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another&mdash;[[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] had been rivals when Marvel was [[Timely Comics]] (Marvel Vault)&mdash; but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share a world.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''. ''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>  The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in [[New York City]]; by contrast, many [[DC Universe|DC heroes]] live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Multiverse]] resembling [[DC multiverse|DC's parallel worlds]]; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap. What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally not affect what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe. However, writers would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Marvel published the miniseries ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat.  This was Marvel's first miniseries.  Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvel's series of reference material, ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', which followed shortly on the heels of ''Contest of Champions''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Concepts==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}\nThe Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world. Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc.), same historical events (such as World War II), and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as [[Wakanda]] and [[Latveria]] (very small nations) and organizations like the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its enemies, [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] In 2009 Marvel officially described its world's geography in a two-part miniseries, the ''Marvel Atlas''.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1787.Travel_The_World_With_The_Marvel_Atlas Travel \"The World With The Marvel Atlas\"]. Marvel.com News</ref><!-- We need a primary source for this!-->\n\nMost importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] concepts, with writers adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe. (A universe incorporating ''all'' these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare; another example is the [[DC Universe]].)  Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe. One such case is [[Fin Fang Foom]] arising from the ashes of tantric magic.  Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, who have gained their powers by any of these means.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nComparatively, little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in \"real-time\". Marvel's major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has (after a prolonged period of being identified as about 10 years in the mid-to-late 1990s) most recently been identified as 13 years.<ref>''The Thing'' #13 (July 2006); ''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref> Consequently, the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years to \"make sense\" in this [[floating timeline]]. Thus, the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years before the publishing date of the current issue. For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s high school graduation was published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September 1965), his college graduation in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #185 (October 1978), and his high school reunion in ''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7 (December 2004). Because of the floating timeline, where stories refer to real-life historic events, these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities; for instance, the origin of [[Iron Man]] was changed in a 2004 storyline to refer to the [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]],<ref>'' Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #1 (November 2004)</ref> whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Vietnam]]; similarly, [[The Punisher]]'s backstory has also been changed as well.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, ([[Captain America]]'s [[alter ego]]), have worked for Marvel.{{issue|date=September 2014}} The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes (except for details not known to the public, like their secret identities); many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves, who customarily donate their share of profits to charity. Additionally, the [[DC Comics]] Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said concerning the DC Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nPop culture characters such as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] exist in the Marvel Universe. This is usually justified as a second-hand account of events as told to credited authors [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]], although the general public continues to believe them to be fictional. [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Kull (comics)|Kull the Conqueror]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]] also have real-life existences in the Marvel Universe. The [[Hyborian Era]] of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth-616 pre-recorded history. However, they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters.  This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howard's works before 2006 when they became public domain. As of 2019, Conan the Barbarian, as well as Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane, have been firmly integrated, thanks to Marvel regaining the publishing rights to the characters. Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], the [[Transformers (franchise)|Transformers]], the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (in the character of [[Machine Man]]), [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom the Spaceknight]], the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]], and the [[Shogun Warriors (comics)|Shogun Warriors]]. In most cases, such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid copyright infringement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Costumed superheroes and supervillains===\nWithin the fictional history of the Marvel Universe, the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed, but it came into prominence during the days of the American \"[[Wild West]]\" with heroes such as [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade/the Phantom Rider]]. During the 20th century, the tradition was reinvigorated by [[Captain America|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] and the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in the 1940s, who fought for the [[Allies of World War II]].\n\nMarvel's most prominent heroes were created during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in the 1960s to early 1970s, including [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark/Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner/the Hulk]], [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock/Daredevil]],

[[Rogue (comics)|Anna Marie LeBeau/Rogue]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilation Lee/Jubilee]].\n\nSome of Marvel's more recent creations from the mid-to-late 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, such as [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson/Deadpool]], [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau/Gambit]], [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers/Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Neena Thurman/Domino]], [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Fong/Blink]], the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], [[Yelena Belova]] (also known as the second Black Widow), the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the modern [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the modern [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (based off [[The Defenders (miniseries)|the Netflix MCU version of the same name]]), [[X-23|Laura Kinney/X-23]] (a.k.a. the second Wolverine), [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]], the [[Dora Milaje]], [[Daisy Johnson]] (also known as Quake), [[Phil Coulson]], [[Melinda May]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier]], [[Maria Hill]], [[Miles Morales]] (the second Spider-Man of the Ultimate Marvel Universe), [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]] (also known as the Red Queen and the second Wasp), [[Cassandra Lang]] (also known as Stature, Stinger, Ant-Girl and Giant-Girl), the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], [[Amadeus Cho]] (also known as the second Hulk), [[Kamala Khan]] (also known as the second Ms. Marvel), [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] (also known as the third Hawkeye), [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunaella Lafayette/Moon Girl]], [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] (also known as the second Miss America), [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] (also known as the fourth Ghost Rider), [[Ironheart (character)|Riri Williams/Ironheart]] and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] ([[Gwen Stacy]] of Earth-65) have become popular characters in their own right. Unlike the [[DC Universe]], few of Marvel's 1940s characters have risen to prominence in modern publications; [[Captain America]] is one exception, and to a lesser extent, his contemporary, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and the Marvel Universe during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nProminent teams of superheroes include the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Inhumans]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Howling Commandos]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the [[Midnight Sons]] and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All these groups have varying lineups; the Avengers have included Marvel's major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men are a team of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] led by [[Professor X]] and include many of Marvel's most popular characters, such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and others. The Fantastic Four are viewed as \"Marvel's First Family\" of superheroes, usually consisting of [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as well as siblings [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards]]. The Defenders were an ad-hoc team usually brought together by [[Doctor Strange]] which has included the [[Hulk]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]], while the most recent incarnation of the team consists of street-level New York City heroes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. The Guardians of the Galaxy include Marvel's cosmic characters such as [[Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Groot]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]], but the team has also introduced other heroes into the roster such as [[Kitty Pryde]], the Silver Surfer, the Thing and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. The Inhumans are a royal family comprising of [[Black Bolt]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Crystal]], [[Gorgon]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Karnak|Karnak the Shatterer]] and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], who rule the city of Attilan. The Runaways are a group of teenagers and a dinosaur consisting of [[Alex Wilder]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Gert Yorkes]] and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] who rebel against their evil parents known as [[The Pride (comics)|the Pride]]. The Midnight Sons consist of supernatural heroes such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade the Vampire-Slayer]], the [[Ghost Rider]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Daemon Hellstrom|Hellstorm the Son of Satan]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]] and the [[Man-Thing]]. The Thunderbolts' original incarnation were supervillains disguised as superheroes consisting of [[Citizen V]] (a.k.a. [[Helmut Zemo]]), [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] (a.k.a. the Beetle), [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] (a.k.a. Screaming Mimi), [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] (a.k.a. Meteorite), [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno/the Ogre]] (a.k.a. the Fixer) and [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], while the current incarnation of the team is made up of reformed supervillains working for the government: [[Deadpool]], the [[Punisher]], the [[Red Hulk]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Although teams of supervillains are few and far between, notable examples include the [[Masters of Evil]], the [[Emissaries of Evil]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Frightful Four]], the [[Lethal Legion]], the [[Legion of the Unliving]], the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], the [[Annihilation Wave]], the [[Starforce]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]].\n\n===Origin of superhuman powers===\nMost of the superhumans in Marvel's Earth owe their powers to the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our [[prehistoric]] ancestors (a process they also carried out on several other planets). This resulted in the creation of two [[Hidden races (Marvel Comics)|hidden races]], the godlike [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] and the genetically unstable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], in addition to giving some humans an \"x-factor\" in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s. Others require other factors (such as [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]]) for their powers to come forth. Depending on the genetic profile, individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury, while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest. Except for [[psionic]] abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have the same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanity's evolution. A Marvel series titled ''[[Earth X]]'' explored one possible reason for this: that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside Earth against any planetary threats and have done so for eons. An X-Men villain that is known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be a new direction in human evolution, as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being. The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nOther possible origins for superhuman powers include [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and/or [[Bionics|bionic]] implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius-level intelligence, such as Reed Richards ([[Mister Fantastic]]) of the Fantastic Four. However, most of the advanced devices (such as [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] and [[death ray]]s) are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. One major company producing these devices is Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or [[time travel]]ers like [[Kang the Conqueror]], who is known to have influenced the [[robotics]] industry in the past.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn superhumans, the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source or, if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver, comes from another source. In most cases, this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field (UPF), which they can tap into. Sometimes they are connected to another source, and more rarely they are even a host for it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMarvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources \"scientifically\", usually through the use of fictional science-like concepts, such as:\n* Energy absorption (the battery effect); the cells in the body have the same function as batteries, being charged with energy that comes from an outer source. This is most often seen in gamma ray-exposed individuals such as the Hulk, who get their powers from this stored energy. The powers will remain as long as the energy is present, and can even be increased by filling the \"batteries\" even more. If the energy is emptied, the powers will fade away.\n* The [[Power Primordial]] is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the [[Elders of the Universe]].\n* The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] is a force of incredible power. It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[telepaths]] like [[Jean Grey]].\n* Psionic energy, which is assumed to be an invisible, unknown form of energy generated by living brains that can manipulate other forms of matter and energy.\n* The universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe, but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy.\n* The Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse and is also the source of its counterpart on Earth the Uni-Power, which transforms an individual into Captain Universe.\n* Extradimensional space: dimensions that can be tapped to pull mass from them (to add to objects on Earth) or taken away from those objects and be stored in those \"pocket dimensions\" to be retrieved later. This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass. A type of subatomic particles called Pym particles can be used for these effects (Note: many giant-sized characters have a limited ability to manipulate gravity to handle their increased weight). The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead, allowing a character to become harder or [[incorporeal]]. Some characters can seem to \"transform\" themselves (or others) into unliving substances, or even pure energy, by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension, while their souls remain on Earth, controlling their new body. Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to \"[[Teleportation|teleport]]\" by re-entering the Earth dimension at a different point.\n* The [[Darkforce]] is an unknown, dark substance from another dimension (known simply as the [[Darkforce Dimension]]) that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways: to create impenetrable darkness, to solidify it in various forms, and (most notably) to absorb the \"life energy\" from living beings (not all users can use all these effects). The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension, but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers. Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it.  Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers, including [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], the first [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] and [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]] (of the [[Squadron Supreme]] Universe). Cloak seems to be the prime 'portal' to the Darkforce, however.\n* The [[Lightforce]] is the opposite of the Darkforce: a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its dimension, but has healing effects on living beings (except ones made of darkness or the Darkforce). It is unknown if it might be sentient. Cloak's partner, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] seems to be the Lightforce's main [[avatar]].\n* The [[Power Cosmic]] is a force that can alter reality, allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants (including bending the laws of physics), only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time. It seems to be part of the universe itself and is most prominently used by [[Galactus]] and his [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds]].\n* Magic also appears to be like a form of energy, except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally, and usually overrules ordinary science. However, it does have rules of its own to follow, which vary with the method of invocation, usually in the form of spoken spells. It appears to be present in everything, even living beings. All humans in the Marvel Universe can use magic, but only if properly trained. Most people are unaware that magic works. Also, powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific, extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used (often indiscriminately) by those [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s who invoke their names; one example is the trinity of beings called the Vishanti, who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers. At any given time, there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extra-dimensional mystical invaders; this sorcerer is known as the [[Sorcerer Supreme]], an office left empty since the death of [[Brother Voodoo]], but most recently has been reinstated to [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #34 (November 2012)</ref> Stars in the Marvel Universe are sentient beings, and the source of all mystic energy.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #24 (August 1977)</ref>\n* Pym particles are what make people shrink and grow.\n\n===Nonhuman===\nA degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a species or even a subspecies of humans (''Homo superior'' or ''Homo sapiens superior'') that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans (the X-Men and their affiliated groups), those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance ([[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers, as well as other mutants such as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known as the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] as weapons.  Certain species are regarded as [[Untermensch|subhuman]], like the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities. The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to mutants, Eternals, and Deviants, several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth. These include the [[Inhumans]], another genetically unstable race (like the Deviants, but in their case, it is due to their use of a substance called the \"Terrigen Mists\") that was created by a [[Kree]] experiment long ago; the [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterraneans]], a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface, created by the Deviants (some Subterraneans were transformed into the 'Lava Men' by a demon); and ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', a [[humanoid]] species of water-breathers that live in Earth's oceans. Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times. More variants of humanity can be found in the [[Savage Land]] (see Places below). Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape-men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments and whose influence is present in all modern ''Homo sapiens''. Other leftovers from the era when primitive humanoids walked on Earth still exist, such as the radiation-altered [[Neanderthal]] man known as the [[Missing Link (comics)|Missing Link]], an enemy of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #105-106</ref>\n\n===Alien races===\n{{Main|List of alien races in Marvel Comics}}\nThe Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races. Earth has interacted with many of them because a major \"[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] warp\" happens to exist in the [[Solar System]].\n\nThe three major space empires are:\n* the [[Kree]], who rule the Kree Empire (in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]])\n* the [[Skrull]]s, who rule the Skrull Empire (in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]])\n* the [[Shi'ar]], who rule the Shi'ar Empire (no known real-world counterpart for its galaxy, but it might be in the [[Triangulum Galaxy]]<ref>Triangulum is the third-largest galaxy of the Local Group and located more or less between the two main members of the group, Andromeda and the Milky Way.</ref>)\nThe three are often in direct or indirect conflict, which occasionally involves Earth humans; in particular, the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies, and the [[Kree-Skrull War]] has involved humans on several occasions.\n\nThe Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians, who live on a milky planet named Majesdane.<ref name=\" Vol2#8\">'' Runaways'' (vol. 2) #8</ref> The war between the two had started after two Majesdanians, Frank and Leslie Dean of [[Pride (comics)|the Pride]] had been kicked out for criminal activities; the two traveled to Earth, where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane, which was hidden behind the corona of a [[white dwarf]]. The war had gone on for 16 years minimum; it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane, who retaliated.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/>\n\nAnother prominent alien race is the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events, though the Watcher assigned to Earth, [[Uatu]], has violated this oath on several occasions.\n\nThe [[Elders of the Universe]] are ancient aliens who have often had a great impact on many worlds for billions of years, acting alone or as a group. A power called the Power Primordial is channeled through them.\n\nMany other races exist and have formed an \"Intergalactic Council\" to have their say on matters that affect them all, such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs.\n\n===Supernatural creatures===\nAlso abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] and [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]. The 'gods' of most [[polytheistic]] pantheons are powerful, immortal human-like races residing in other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times, and became the basis of many legends. However, all of these 'gods' share a common ancestry and connection to Earth due to [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], the primeval Elder Goddess that infused her life essence into all living things on Earth. Gaea is known by various names and appearances in other cultures and among the various pantheons, but she is the same being. As a result, she is a member of every polytheistic pantheon of 'gods' worshiped by humans. Besides mythological gods, many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well, such as the Dark Gods, enemies of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The Dark Gods are a race of 'gods' that have been worshiped by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] races. Well-known alien races like the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]]s also have beings they worship as 'gods', though little has been revealed about them.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from [[Judeo-Christian]] beliefs have turned out to be the real article, although several angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real-world religious belief. Similarly, [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe. Some of the most powerful are [[Blackheart]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], [[Satannish]], [[Thog (comics)|Thog the Nether-Spawn]] and [[Zom]]. There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as the Vishanti; or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic, such as [[Dormammu]] and [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|the Octessence]], or ones heavily drawing upon the mythologies of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]]. Some supernatural beings, entities and human characters created by Lovecraft and Howard, who were friends and influenced each other's work, have been adapted by Marvel and include [[Abdul Alhazred]],<ref>''Tarzan'' #15 (August 1978)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62 (November 1990)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #152 (April 1994)</ref> [[Conan the Barbarian]]<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #1 (July 1971)</ref> [[Nyarlathotep]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' (vol. 2) #4 (June 1973)</ref> and [[Father Set|Set]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 (May 1976)</ref> Some deities or demonic beings that are original characters of Marvel have been heavily influenced by these mythologies, such as [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #10 (September 1973)</ref>\n\nMost of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]]. The two most featured pantheons are the [[Norse mythology|Asgardians]] (of whom [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is a member) and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] (of whom [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is a member). The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as either the Council of Godheads or the Council of Skyfathers. The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity (at least openly) a thousand years ago by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and most people today believe them to be fictional. Other pantheons have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that is still actively worshiped in the real world, including those worshiped by the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] inhabitants of [[Australia]], the [[Hindu deities|gods]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Shinto]] gods and the gods of [[Zoroastrianism]]. These deities are rarely depicted, however. One such appearance generated a good deal of controversy as the depiction involved a fight between [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's incarnation of Thor]] and the Hindu god [[Shiva]], a battle which Shiva lost.<ref>''Thor'' #301 (November 1980)</ref> As Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hindu religion, his defeat offended some followers of Hinduism. This battle was [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned later as having been the deity [[Indra]], the Hindu god of thunder, who was posing as Shiva, that met defeat.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> To avoid offending the believers of still active religions, Marvel features such deities as characters in the background or who make very brief cameo appearances.\n\nMarvel's depiction of vampires has been heavily influenced by various interpretations of popular media, such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''. As with many other supernatural creatures, Marvel entwined the origin of vampires with aspects of the mythologies created by Lovecraft and Howard. They were created by magical rites performed by priests of Atlantis before the Great Cataclysm that destroyed much of the world, with [[Varnae]] becoming the first vampire. Marvel would depict vampires as frequent antagonists during the [[Hyborian Age]] to Howard characters such as [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] and Conan. In recent years, Marvel's depiction of vampires has altered greatly by creating various subspecies of vampires that exist in [[clan]]s that greatly differ in appearance and belief. All vampires are depicted with varying degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and accelerated healing. Many are capable of transforming into animals such as bats or wolves; some can transform into a mist-like substance; some of the most powerful are capable of controlling the weather to a somewhat limited degree. All vampires must ingest blood to maintain their survival and physical vitality. So long as they do so regularly, they cease to age and are immune to diseases. They retain the well-known vulnerabilities common to vampires in other media interpretations, including sunlight, garlic, religious icons and weapons made of silver. Vampires can be killed by a wooden stake driven through the heart, though they return to life if the stake is removed. Vampires are highly allergic to silver and can be killed with it. While they normally heal rapidly, injuries inflicted by silver weapons heal at a much slower rate if the injuries are not fatal. Vampires can also be killed by decapitation or being burned with fire, with burning them to ashes and then scattering the ashes being the most effective means of ensuring their demise (scattering the ashes is done so that the vampire cannot be mystically resurrected).\n\n===Cosmic entities===\nThe [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] are beings of unbelievably great levels of power (the weakest of whom can destroy entire planets) who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe. Most do not care at all about \"lesser beings\" such as humans, and as a consequence, their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals. When dire threats threaten the universe, it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat and even act on it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMost conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their essential function or to keep the balance with an opposing force. However, certain cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], or the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] have demonstrated personality, motivations, or (except for the first one mentioned) even ambitions beyond their functions, but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative, or that destroying civilizations of \"lesser\" beings is no eviler than if these beings destroyed an anthill. Others such as [[Uatu the Watcher]], [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], or the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] [[Ashema the Listener|Ashema]] and [[Dreaming Celestial|Tiamut]] are aberrations in the sense of sympathizing with, and occasionally coming to the defense of, humanity.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe \"'''Fulcrum'''\" is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy, that \"all\" cosmic entities allegedly serve, of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials. Unlike most other entities, it is capable of conscience, compassion, and even a sense of humor, and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well. He is a possible manifestation/[[avatar]] of the [[One Above All]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] first received personification in [[Jean Grey]]. The Phoenix Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings' past, present, and future, and is an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through \"burning away what doesn't work\", and helped to restart the universe before the [[Big Bang]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Cosmology==\nThe Marvel Universe is part of a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], with various universes coexisting simultaneously, ''usually'' without affecting each other directly.{{issue|date=September 2014}} According to Reed Richards, the ultimate fate of the Multiverse is to perish in all-encompassing heat death.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===Universes/Earths/continuities===\nThe action of most of the Marvel Comics titles takes place in a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] known as [[Earth-616]]. This continuity exists in a [[multiverse]] alongside trillions of alternative continuities.<ref>''Exiles Annual'' #1 (November 2006)</ref> Alternative continuities in the Marvel Multiverse are generally defined in terms of their differences from Earth-616.\n\nContinuities besides Earth-616 include the following (for a complete listing see [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]):\n\n* ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''- an alternate reality ruled by the mutant god [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Designated as '''[[Earth-93060]]'''.\n* ''[[X-Men Adventures]]'' - originally based on the [[X-Men (TV series)|'' X-Men'' animated series]], this universe went on to feature more original stories, and in its final issue revealed itself to be the universe which existed before the current Earth-616 reality, when it was destroyed by the fracturing of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. The current edition of the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' corroborates this.\n* [[Earth-96283]] - an alternate reality in which Spider-Man is the only superhero on Earth. [[Sam Raimi]]'s Spider-Man trilogy takes place here.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-96283|title=Earth-96283|website=Marvel Database|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n* Earth 615 - sometimes being the same universe as [[Earth-616]], and sometimes not.\n* Earth 1218 - The setting of the real world, where supernatural entities don't exist.\n\nIn addition, multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', ''[[What The--?!]]'' (formerly ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'') and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''. The concept of continuity is not the same as a \"dimension\" or a \"universe\"; for example, characters like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Dormammu]] hail from parallel dimensions and [[Galactus]] from the universe that existed before the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth-616 continuity (where all the parallel dimensions and alternate universes seem to be connected to the same main timeline). A continuity should also not be confused with an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]; for example, while the titles of some imprints, such as [[Ultimate Marvel]], take place in a different continuity, some or all publications in other imprints, such as [[Epic Comics]], [[Marvel MAX]], and [[Marvel UK]], take place within the Earth-616 continuity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Dimensions===\nWithin and sometimes ''between'' continuities, there exist a variety of ''dimensions'', sometimes called ''pocket dimensions'', which typically are not depicted as separate continuities, but rather part of one, typically Earth-616. There is a score of such dimensions, ranging from the Earth-like to the alien. Some are magical and others are scientific; some are inhabited and others are not. These include realities like the [[Microverse]], the [[Darkforce|Darkforce Dimension]], [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]], the [[Mojoverse]], and many more. The [[Astral Plane]] is a dimensional plane that is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers. It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess Oshtur that is sometimes referred to as the \"Temple of Oshtur\" or the \"Realm of the Mind\".<ref name=\"ma1\">'' Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot'' one-shot, Marvel Publishing, Inc. 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite various contradictions, the term ''dimension'' is sometimes interchangeable with ''universe'' or ''reality''. Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to [[Earth-616]] characters. Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are not \"pocket dimensions\" as they reside completely ''outside'' the boundaries of the Marvel Universe instead of within, as the former does.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Time===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nOne cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe's history; if a time-traveler should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|divergent universe]] will simply \"branch out\" from the existing timeline, and the time-traveler will still return to his or her unaltered original universe. Those realities can also spawn realities of their own. There exist hundreds, probably thousands of such realities. It is unknown why this happens, though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida Everglades of Earth-616. For the most part, this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently \"born\" from another. However, individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities. These include [[Immortus]], the [[Captain Britain|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[Time Variance Authority]], the [[Timebreaker]]s/[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s forces. It is possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead of altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in [[Marvel 1602]] (it almost destroyed the whole multiverse, including the [[afterlife]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAlso, time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world. Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades, few, if any, have aged to any appreciable degree. For example, the patriotic hero [[Captain America]] was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of [[World War II]]. The character was revived more than 20 years later, explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead, to lead Marvel's latest team of superheroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the company's most famous and most popular. Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or not at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nNaturally, this tendency is purely due to story conveniences (or a somewhat haphazardly shifting patchwork pattern of authors), and mainly that the fictional \"continuity\" has been maintained and expanded far beyond what [[Stan Lee]] and others originally planned or hoped for. Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of [[Spider-Man]]; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], [[Valeria Richards]], [[Power Pack]], or the [[New Mutants]] are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates (in the second case even backward at times), whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all. This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects, as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago, even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved characters would have been toddlers. Different approaches also exist regarding allowing \"second-generation\" descendants of heroes or villains, full-grown over 18 years after an event (for example, [[Hulkling]], other members of the [[Young Avengers]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]), whereas other books, such as ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroic Age|Young Allies]]'' use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims. If a past storyline wherein a direct depiction of a then-current president or similar is referred to in a later era, it tends to become updated accordingly, sometimes with an \"in-joke\" acknowledgment.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA more recent explanation was given by Galactus to the Ultimates, namely that some important events - for instance, the creation of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers -  have a 'gravity' all their own and warp time around them, causing the timeline to subtly change to accommodate this.<ref>''Ultimates'' (2015) #5</ref>\n\n===Space===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nWhile the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the [[Local Group]] is the universe; practically all action takes place in it. The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth, of course, is found, and the Shi\u00b4ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies (perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy); frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers \"in the universe\". Similarly, the Local Group seems to be the only affected area when the [[Annihilation Wave]] cut its bloody swath \"across the universe\".\n\n==Role-playing games==\nFour [[role-playing game]]s have been set in the Marvel Universe:\n\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1984)\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1998)\n* ''[[Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game]]'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 2003)\n* ''[[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]]'' ([[Margaret Weis Productions]], 2012)\n\n==See also==\nFor more complete lists of inhabitants of the Marvel Universe, see [[List of Marvel Comics characters]], [[List of Marvel Comics teams and organizations]], and [[List of Marvel Comics alien races]].\n* [[Features of the Marvel Universe]]\n* [[Publication history of Marvel Comics crossover events]]\n* ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''\n* [[List of Marvel Comics superhero debuts]]\n* [[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|'' Marvel Super Heroes'' (role-playing game)]]\n* [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the official film and TV franchise of all Marvel Comics characters owned by [[Marvel Studios]]/[[Disney]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com Marvel Entertainment] (official site)\n* [http://www.chronologyproject.com Marvel Chronology Project]\n* [http://s15.zetaboards.com/MUA/index/] (Forums named after Marvel Universe)\n\n{{Marvel Comics}}\n{{Marvel Multiverse}}\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Marvel Characters}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Superhero fiction]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics dimensions|Marvel Comics dimensions]]\n[[Category:Canons (fiction)]]\n[[Category:Marvel Entertainment franchises]]\n[[Category:Fictional universes]]\n[[Category:Mythopoeia]]\n", "name_user": "Bong009", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCostumed superheroes and supervillains", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe"}

Another feature is the idea that democracy is an un-finished, inclusive, continuous and reflexive process.<ref name=\":0\" /> Citizens could directly participate in democratic self-governance. \n\n== Theories ==\nWithin radical democracy there are three distinct strands, as articulated by Lincoln Dahlberg.<ref name=\":0\" /> These strands can be labeled as deliberative, agonistic and autonomist.\n\nThe first and most noted strand of radical democracy is the agonistic perspective, which is associated with the work of Laclau and Mouffe. Radical democracy was articulated by [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] in their book ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]'', written in 1985. They argue that [[social movements]] which attempt to create [[Social change|social and political change]] need a strategy which challenges [[neoliberal]] and [[neoconservative]] concepts of [[democracy]].<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" /> This strategy is to expand the [[Liberalism|liberal]] definition of democracy, based on [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Equality before the law|equality]], to include [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]].<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" />\n\nAccording to Laclau and Mouffe \"Radical democracy\" means \"the root of democracy\".<ref>Dahlberg, L.

Radical democracy is not only accepting of difference, [[dissent]] and antagonisms, but is dependent on it.<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" /> Laclau and Mouffe argue based on the assumption that there are oppressive [[Power (philosophy)|power]] relations that exist in society and that those oppressive relations should be made visible, re-negotiated and altered.<ref>Laclau, E and Mouffe, C.

This strand of radical democracy is opposed to the agonistic perspective of Laclau and Mouffe. Habermas argues that political problems surrounding the organization of life can be resolved by [[deliberation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/jurgen-habermas/deliberative-democracy/F9D4327C35D306E5EA49E66DD90445E5|chapter=Deliberative democracy|last=Olson|first=Kevin|editor1-first=Barbara|editor1-last=Fultner|date=2011|website=J\u00fcrgen Habermas: Key Concepts|language=en|doi=10.1017/upo9781844654741.008|title=J\u00fcrgen Habermas|pages=140\u2013155|isbn=9781844654741}}</ref> That is, people coming together and deliberating on the best possible solution. This type of radical democracy is in contrast with the agonistic perspective based on consensus and communicative means: there is a reflexive critical process of coming to the best solution.<ref name=\":1\" /> Equality and freedom are at the root of Habermas\u00b4 deliberative theory. The deliberation is established through [[institution]]s that can ensure free and equal participation of all.<ref name=\":1\" /> Habermas is aware of the fact that different cultures, world-views and ethics can lead to difficulties in the deliberative process. Despite this fact he argues that the communicative reason can create a bridge between opposing views and interests.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe third strand of radical democracy is the autonomist strand, which is associated with left-communist and post-Marxist ideas. The difference between this type of radical democracy and the two noted above is the focus on \"the community.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[community]] is seen as the pure constituted power instead of the deliberative rational individuals or the agonistic groups as in the first two strands. The community is resembles a \"plural multitude\" (of people) instead of the [[working class]] in traditional Marxist theory.<ref name=\":0\" /> This plural multitude is the pure constituted power and reclaims this power by searching and creating mutual understandings within the community.<ref name=\":0\" /> This strand of radical democracy challenges the traditional thinking about equality and freedom in liberal democracies by stating that individual equality can be found in the singularities within the multitude, equality overall is created by an all-inclusive multitude and freedom is created by restoring the multitude in its pure constituted power.<ref name=\":0\" /> This strand of radical democracy is often a term used to refer to the post-Marxist perspectives of [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Italian radicalism]] - for example [[Paolo Virno]].  {{Democracy}}\n\n== Theorists ==\n\n=== Agonistic perspective ===\n\n*[[William E. Connolly]] - Connoly is associated with his promotion of an [[agonistic democracy]]. An agonistic democracy is focused on contestation rather than on rational consensus.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Identity, difference : democratic negotiations of political paradox|last=Connolly, William E.|date=2002|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816694457|edition=Expanded|location=Minneapolis, MN|oclc=191934259}}</ref> The discourse is not violence-based, but engages different aspects of political conflict.

Wolin]] - Wolin\u00b4s political thought clearly aligns with the ideal of an [[participatory democracy]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|last=XENOS|first=NICHOLAS|chapter=Momentary Democracy|pages=25\u201338|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691186771|doi=10.2307/j.ctv39x8g6.5|title=Democracy and Vision|year=2018}}</ref> Wolin was the first in articulating the idea of a \u00a8fugitive democracy\u00a8 in which democracy is a political experience and the ordinary people are the primary political actors. Wolin challenged consensus and can therefore be position within the agonistic perspective of radical democracy.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Deliberative perspective ===\n\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] - As noted above, a proponent of a deliberative democracy and therefore positioned within the deliberative perspective. \n* [[John Rawls]] - Together with Habermas one of the most influential proponents of deliberative democracy. For Rawls, there is a need for certain conditions in democracy that can ensure the equal participation of all citizens.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Samar|first=Vincent J.|date=1995|title=Just Society: A review of John Rawls, Political Liberalism - Political LiberalismJohn Rawls New York: Columbia University Press, 1993|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|volume=5|issue=3|pages=629\u2013645|doi=10.2307/3857403|issn=1052-150X|jstor=3857403}}</ref> Rawls advocated for the use of reason and self-interest to justify a fair political system. He also creates the term \u00a8[[overlapping consensus]]\u00a8 which entails that although different multicultural groups in society have contrasting norms and values, there are always overlapping agreement on certain important social, economical and political topics.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Autonomist perspective ===\n\n*[[Cornel West]] - West describes himself as a radical democrat and a non-Marxist socialist, which positions him in the critical post-Marxist strand of radical democracy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cornel West reader|last=West, Cornel.|date=1999|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|isbn=0465091091|edition=1st|location=New York, NY|oclc=42706265}}</ref>\n*[[Raya Dunayevskaya]] - Associated with the critical post-Marxist strand of radical democracy.\n*[[Paolo Virno]] - Figurehead for the Italian Autonomist Marxist movement.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n=== Critique on the agonistic perspective ===\nLaclau and Mouffe have argued for radical agonistic democracy, where different opinions and worldviews are not oppressed by the search for consensus in liberal and deliberative democracy. As this agonistic perspective has been most influential in academic literature, it has been subject to most criticisms on the idea of radical democracy. Brockelman for example argues that the theory of radical democracy is an [[Utopian ideal|Utopian idea]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brockelman|first1=Thomas|date=2003|title=The failure of the radical democratic imaginary: \u017di\u017eek versus Laclau and Mouffe on vestigial utopia.|journal=Philosophy & Social Criticism|volume=29|page=185|doi=10.1177/0191453703029002144}}</ref> Political theory, he argues, should not be used as offering a vision of a desirable society. In the same vein, it is argued that radical democracy might be useful at the local level, but does not offer a realistic perception of [[decision-making]] on the national level.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Studebaker |first1=Benjamin |title=A Critique of Radical Democracy |url=https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2014/02/27/a-critique-of-radical-democracy/ |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> For example, people might know what they want to see changing in their town and feel the urge to participate in the decision-making process of future local policy. Developing an opinion about issues at the local level often does not require specific skills or education. Deliberation in order to combat the problem of [[groupthink]], in which the view of the majority dominates over the view of the minority, can be useful in this setting. However, people might not be skilled enough or willing to decide about national or international problems. A radical democracy approach for overcoming the flaws of democracy is, it is argued, not suitable for levels higher than the local one.\n\n=== Critique on the deliberative perspective ===\nHabermas and Rawls have argued for radical deliberative democracy, where consensus and communicative means are at the root of politics. However, some scholars identify multiple tensions between participation and deliberation. Three of these tensions are identified by [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a student of the philosopher [[John Rawls]]:<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Joshua|last2=Fung|first2=Archon|date=2011|title=Le projet de la d\u00e9mocratie radicale|journal=Raisons Politiques|language=fr|volume=42|issue=2|pages=115|doi=10.3917/rai.042.0115|issn=1291-1941}}</ref>\n\n# Wanting to improve the quality of deliberation can be at the expense of public participation. In this case, representatives and legislators are more focused on argumentation and deliberation than on seeking to advance the interests of their [[Constituent (politics)|constituent]]s. By focusing on reasonable deliberation the interests of particular constituents can be underrepresented.<ref name=\":6\" />\n# Conversely, seeking to maximize the public participation can be at the expense of the quality of deliberation. Maximize public participation can be accomplished by popular initiatives like [[referendum]]s. Referendums however allows people to decide on an important topic with an yes/no vote. By using a yes/no vote people can be discouraged to engage in a reasoned discussion in creating legislation. It is also argued that through maximizing public participation, [[wikt:manipulation|manipulation]] and [[wikt:suppression|suppression]] become present.<ref name=\":6\" />\n# Deliberation depends on sufficient knowledge and interests from all participants as well as adequate and easy accessible information.

Another feature is the idea that democracy is an un-finished, inclusive, continuous and reflexive process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Theories ==\nWithin radical democracy there are three distinct strands, as articulated by Lincoln Dahlberg.<ref name=\":0\" /> These strands can be labeled as deliberative, agonistic and autonomist.\n\nThe first and most noted strand of radical democracy is the agonistic perspective, which is associated with the work of Laclau and Mouffe. Radical democracy was articulated by [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] in their book ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]'', written in 1985. They argue that [[social movements]] which attempt to create [[Social change|social and political change]] need a strategy which challenges [[neoliberal]] and [[neoconservative]] concepts of [[democracy]].<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" /> This strategy is to expand the [[Liberalism|liberal]] definition of democracy, based on [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Equality before the law|equality]], to include [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]].<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" />\n\nAccording to Laclau and Mouffe \"Radical democracy\" means \"the root of democracy\".<ref>Dahlberg, L. (2012).

Radical democracy is not only accepting of difference, [[dissent]] and antagonisms, but is dependent on it.<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" /> Laclau and Mouffe argue based on the assumption that there are oppressive [[Power (philosophy)|power]] relations that exist in society and that those oppressive relations should be made visible, re-negotiated and altered.<ref>Laclau, E and Mouffe, C.

[[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref> By building democracy around difference and dissent, oppressive power relations existing in societies are able to come to the forefront so that they can be challenged.<ref name=\"Dahlberg, L. 2012\" />\n\nThe second strand, deliberative, is mostly associated with the work of [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. This strand of radical democracy is opposed to the agonistic perspective of Laclau and Mouffe. Habermas argues that political problems surrounding the organization of life can be resolved by [[deliberation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/jurgen-habermas/deliberative-democracy/F9D4327C35D306E5EA49E66DD90445E5|chapter=Deliberative democracy|last=Olson|first=Kevin|editor1-first=Barbara|editor1-last=Fultner|date=2011|website=J\u00fcrgen Habermas: Key Concepts|language=en|doi=10.1017/upo9781844654741.008|title=J\u00fcrgen Habermas|pages=140\u2013155|isbn=9781844654741}}</ref> That is, people coming together and deliberating on the best possible solution. This type of radical democracy is in contrast with the agonistic perspective based on consensus and communicative means: there is a reflexive critical process of coming to the best solution.<ref name=\":1\" /> Equality and freedom are at the root of Habermas\u00b4 deliberative theory. The deliberation is established through [[institution]]s that can ensure free and equal participation of all.<ref name=\":1\" /> Habermas is aware of the fact that different cultures, world-views and ethics can lead to difficulties in the deliberative process. Despite this fact he argues that the communicative reason can create a bridge between opposing views and interests.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe third strand of radical democracy is the autonomist strand, which is associated with left-communist and post-Marxist ideas. The difference between this type of radical democracy and the two noted above is the focus on \"the community.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[community]] is seen as the pure constituted power instead of the deliberative rational individuals or the agonistic groups as in the first two strands. The community is resembles a \"plural multitude\" (of people) instead of the [[working class]] in traditional Marxist theory.<ref name=\":0\" /> This plural multitude is the pure constituted power and reclaims this power by searching and creating mutual understandings within the community.<ref name=\":0\" /> This strand of radical democracy challenges the traditional thinking about equality and freedom in liberal democracies by stating that individual equality can be found in the singularities within the multitude, equality overall is created by an all-inclusive multitude and freedom is created by restoring the multitude in its pure constituted power.<ref name=\":0\" /> This strand of radical democracy is often a term used to refer to the post-Marxist perspectives of [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Italian radicalism]] - for example [[Paolo Virno]].  {{Democracy}}\n\n== Theorists ==\n\n=== Agonistic perspective ===\n\n*[[William E. Connolly]] - Connoly is associated with his promotion of an [[agonistic democracy]]. An agonistic democracy is focused on contestation rather than on rational consensus.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Identity, difference : democratic negotiations of political paradox|last=Connolly, William E.|date=2002|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816694457|edition=Expanded|location=Minneapolis, MN|oclc=191934259}}</ref> The discourse is not violence-based, but engages different aspects of political conflict.

As this agonistic perspective has been most influential in academic literature, it has been subject to most criticisms on the idea of radical democracy. Brockelman for example argues that the theory of radical democracy is an [[Utopian ideal|Utopian idea]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brockelman|first1=Thomas|date=2003|title=The failure of the radical democratic imaginary: \u017di\u017eek versus Laclau and Mouffe on vestigial utopia.|journal=Philosophy & Social Criticism|volume=29|page=185|doi=10.1177/0191453703029002144}}</ref> Political theory, he argues, should not be used as offering a vision of a desirable society. In the same vein, it is argued that radical democracy might be useful at the local level, but does not offer a realistic perception of [[decision-making]] on the national level.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Studebaker |first1=Benjamin |title=A Critique of Radical Democracy |url=https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2014/02/27/a-critique-of-radical-democracy/ |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> For example, people might know what they want to see changing in their town and feel the urge to participate in the decision-making process of future local policy. Developing an opinion about issues at the local level often does not require specific skills or education. Deliberation in order to combat the problem of [[groupthink]], in which the view of the majority dominates over the view of the minority, can be useful in this setting. However, people might not be skilled enough or willing to decide about national or international problems. A radical democracy approach for overcoming the flaws of democracy is, it is argued, not suitable for levels higher than the local one.\n\n=== Critique on the deliberative perspective ===\nHabermas and Rawls have argued for radical deliberative democracy, where consensus and communicative means are at the root of politics. However, some scholars identify multiple tensions between participation and deliberation. Three of these tensions are identified by [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a student of the philosopher [[John Rawls]]:<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Joshua|last2=Fung|first2=Archon|date=2011|title=Le projet de la d\u00e9mocratie radicale|journal=Raisons Politiques|language=fr|volume=42|issue=2|pages=115|doi=10.3917/rai.042.0115|issn=1291-1941}}</ref>\n\n# Wanting to improve the quality of deliberation can be at the expense of public participation. In this case, representatives and legislators are more focused on argumentation and deliberation than on seeking to advance the interests of their [[Constituent (politics)|constituent]]s. By focusing on reasonable deliberation the interests of particular constituents can be underrepresented.<ref name=\":6\" />\n# Conversely, seeking to maximize the public participation can be at the expense of the quality of deliberation. Maximize public participation can be accomplished by popular initiatives like [[referendum]]s. Referendums however allows people to decide on an important topic with an yes/no vote. By using a yes/no vote people can be discouraged to engage in a reasoned discussion in creating legislation. It is also argued that through maximizing public participation, [[wikt:manipulation|manipulation]] and [[wikt:suppression|suppression]] become present.<ref name=\":6\" />\n# Deliberation depends on sufficient knowledge and interests from all participants as well as adequate and easy accessible information. On many important issues however, the number of participators with sufficient knowledge is rather limited and thus the quality of deliberation declines when more uninformed participants enter the discussion.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Radical democracy and colonialism ===\nBecause of radical democracy's focus on difference, and challenging oppressive power relations, it has been seen as conducive to [[post-colonial theory]] and [[decolonization]].  However, the concept of radical democracy is seen in some circles as colonial in nature due to its reliance on a western notion of democracy.<ref name=\"dhaliwal\">Dhaliwal, A. (1996).
