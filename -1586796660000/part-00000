It is a strategy game where players can control a nation from the [[Late Middle Ages]] through the [[Early modern period]] (1444 to 1821 [[AD]]),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/07/31/crusader-kings-ii-to-europa-universalis-iv-save-converter-interview/ | title=How Paradox\u2019s Crusader Kings II to Europa Universalis IV save converter will work | publisher=[[PC Gamer]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> conducting trade, administration, [[diplomacy]], [[colonization]] and warfare.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game has been formed to begin historically, with real events occurring in real time. The game itself is an interactive map of Earth divided into the [[province]]s that compose nations. Each of these provinces contribute to their country either positively or negatively, as provinces can both provide resources to a nation and serve as a point of unrest and rebellion. The gameplay requires the player to lead a nation by finding a balance of [[military]], [[diplomacy]] and [[economy]]. The player does so through their choices as sovereign of their nation, and through the spending of resources available to them: [[Reputation|Prestige]], Stability, [[Gold]] (Ducats), Manpower, [[Legitimacy (political)|Legitimacy]] for Monarchies, [[Republicanism|Republican Tradition]] for [[Republic]]s, Devotion for [[Theocracies]], Horde Unity for Hordes and Monarch Power (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military).\n\nPlayers can choose to conquer the world by military might, become a colonial superpower, establish trade dominance, etc. as one of over 500 different nations. These nations range alphabetically from [[Aachen]] to [[Zuni]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} The game is a sandbox environment, and while there is no strict rule on winning the game, a loss occurs when the player's nation is removed, or annexed, from the map. [[Diplomacy]] is a large aspect of the game, as creating [[alliance]]s, (or [[vassal state]]s and [[Tributary state|tributaries]]), improving opinions, and preventing defensive coalitions are vital to a player's survival. Espionage can also be employed against enemy states in order to claim their territory, or incite [[rebellion]] in their provinces, along with other dubious ends. Combat can be waged on both land and sea, during which the game attempts to simulate real world factors such as morale, discipline, varying unit types with associated strengths and weaknesses, competency of leaders, terrain and [[Line of communication|supply lines]]. Trade is also an important part of the game, where the world is divided into many trade nodes and trade flows through each of the nodes and can be collected by merchants.\n\nMany major [[religion]]s, such as [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] are present in the game and can provide distinct bonuses to their practitioners. Players can employ missionaries to convert their provinces or can engage in policies of universal religious freedom. For example, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith makes use of the Papacy, which can allow a nation to have control over the [[Pope]] or to use their influence for other rewards. Technological advancements are invested in over time, and will require the expense of monarch points.\n\n* Administrative technologies unlocks advancements such as increased productivity, new forms of government, new buildings, and the national idea system.\n* Diplomatic technology unlocks advancements such as naval units, improvements in trade, new buildings, and improved colonial expansion.\n* Military technology unlocks advancements such as new types of land units, improved unit morale, combat tactics, and new buildings.\n\nGameplay is influenced by random events that arise every so often for the player. These events can be either helpful or harmful. Some of these random events are driven by an individual country's history, while some can apply to any country and serve generally to enhance the \"flavor\" of the game. Players can choose to play single player mode versus the [[AI]], or multiplayer over a [[LAN]] or the Internet against a mix of human and AI opponents. Single player also has the option of \"Ironman\" mode, which locks several settings such as difficulty, and removes the control of saving the game from the player. This means that any mistakes are irreversible. It is, however, the only way to receive any of the game's many achievements.\n\n==Development==\nEarly design discussions for ''Europa Universalis 4'' began shortly after the December 2010 release of ''Divine Wind'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Europa Universalis 3]]''{{cn|date=March 2020}} with development, based on the [[Clausewitz Engine]], beginning in earnest in about September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/Gamescom-2012-Hands-Off-Europa-Universalis-IV-286591.shtml |title=Gamescom 2012 Hands-Off: Europa Universalis IV |website=[[Softpedia]]|first=Andrei |last=Dumitrescu| date=15 August 2012}}</ref> It was first announced to the public in August 2012, to coincide with a showing at that year's [[Gamescom]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcinvasion.com/paradox-reveals-europa-universalis-4-to-be-shown-at-gamescom/|website=PC Invasion| title=Paradox reveals Europa Universalis 4, to be shown at Gamescom |first=Peter |last=Parrish| date= 10 August 2012}}</ref> after having been teased under the codename of \"Project Truman\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/10/paradox-truman-announcement-at-3pm-uk-time/ |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date= 10 August 2012 |first=Adam |last=Smith |title=Paradox 'Truman' Announcement At 3PM UK Time}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game's development, [[Paradox Development Studio]] released weekly \"developer diaries\" via their online forums, in which they detailed some feature of the game's development.{{cn|date=March 2020}} These included information about design philosophy, game mechanics that were being implemented, and features from ''Europa Universalis 3'' that were being removed.\n\nDuring its development, ''Europa Universalis IV'' had a greater priority given to stability and quality control than had previous games in the series.

The largest DLCs come in the form of expansions, which significantly alter the mechanics and features of the game. There are also flavor packs (which add new events and minor mechanics, usually specific to one nation), music packs (which add more backing music) and cosmetic packs (which affect unit models, portraits, and the map). There are also three e-books which have no impact on the game itself, but coincided with the release of expansions.\n\nExpansions are often accompanied by coinciding free patches to the game, which may adjust existing mechanics or add new ones in the theme of the expansion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n! style=\"width: 15%;height:50px;\" |Name\n! style=\"width: 15%;\" |Release date\n!Full Expansion\n!Description\n|-\n|'''''Conquest of Paradise'''''\n|11 January 2014\n|{{Ya}}\n|''Conquest of Paradise'' focuses on the [[New World]].

The game itself is an interactive map of Earth divided into the [[province]]s that compose nations. Each of these provinces contribute to their country either positively or negatively, as provinces can both provide resources to a nation and serve as a point of unrest and rebellion. The gameplay requires the player to lead a nation by finding a balance of [[military]], [[diplomacy]] and [[economy]]. The player does so through their choices as sovereign of their nation, and through the spending of resources available to them: [[Reputation|Prestige]], Stability, [[Gold]] (Ducats), Manpower, [[Legitimacy (political)|Legitimacy]] for Monarchies, [[Republicanism|Republican Tradition]] for [[Republic]]s, Devotion for [[Theocracies]], Horde Unity for Hordes and Monarch Power (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military).\n\nPlayers can choose to conquer the world by military might, become a colonial superpower, establish trade dominance, etc. as one of over 500 different nations. These nations range alphabetically from [[Aachen]] to [[Zuni]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} The game is a sandbox environment, and while there is no strict rule on winning the game, a loss occurs when the player's nation is removed, or annexed, from the map. [[Diplomacy]] is a large aspect of the game, as creating [[alliance]]s, (or [[vassal state]]s and [[Tributary state|tributaries]]), improving opinions, and preventing defensive coalitions are vital to a player's survival. Espionage can also be employed against enemy states in order to claim their territory, or incite [[rebellion]] in their provinces, along with other dubious ends. Combat can be waged on both land and sea, during which the game attempts to simulate real world factors such as morale, discipline, varying unit types with associated strengths and weaknesses, competency of leaders, terrain and [[Line of communication|supply lines]]. Trade is also an important part of the game, where the world is divided into many trade nodes and trade flows through each of the nodes and can be collected by merchants.\n\nMany major [[religion]]s, such as [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] are present in the game and can provide distinct bonuses to their practitioners. Players can employ missionaries to convert their provinces or can engage in policies of universal religious freedom. For example, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith makes use of the Papacy, which can allow a nation to have control over the [[Pope]] or to use their influence for other rewards. Technological advancements are invested in over time, and will require the expense of monarch points.\n\n* Administrative technologies unlocks advancements such as increased productivity, new forms of government, new buildings, and the national idea system.\n* Diplomatic technology unlocks advancements such as naval units, improvements in trade, new buildings, and improved colonial expansion.\n* Military technology unlocks advancements such as new types of land units, improved unit morale, combat tactics, and new buildings.\n\nGameplay is influenced by random events that arise every so often for the player. These events can be either helpful or harmful. Some of these random events are driven by an individual country's history, while some can apply to any country and serve generally to enhance the \"flavor\" of the game. Players can choose to play single player mode versus the [[AI]], or multiplayer over a [[LAN]] or the Internet against a mix of human and AI opponents. Single player also has the option of \"Ironman\" mode, which locks several settings such as difficulty, and removes the control of saving the game from the player. This means that any mistakes are irreversible. It is, however, the only way to receive any of the game's many achievements.\n\n==Development==\nEarly design discussions for ''Europa Universalis 4'' began shortly after the December 2010 release of ''Divine Wind'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Europa Universalis 3]]''{{cn|date=March 2020}} with development, based on the [[Clausewitz Engine]], beginning in earnest in about September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/Gamescom-2012-Hands-Off-Europa-Universalis-IV-286591.shtml |title=Gamescom 2012 Hands-Off: Europa Universalis IV |website=[[Softpedia]]|first=Andrei |last=Dumitrescu| date=15 August 2012}}</ref> It was first announced to the public in August 2012, to coincide with a showing at that year's [[Gamescom]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcinvasion.com/paradox-reveals-europa-universalis-4-to-be-shown-at-gamescom/|website=PC Invasion| title=Paradox reveals Europa Universalis 4, to be shown at Gamescom |first=Peter |last=Parrish| date= 10 August 2012}}</ref> after having been teased under the codename of \"Project Truman\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/10/paradox-truman-announcement-at-3pm-uk-time/ |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date= 10 August 2012 |first=Adam |last=Smith |title=Paradox 'Truman' Announcement At 3PM UK Time}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game's development, [[Paradox Development Studio]] released weekly \"developer diaries\" via their online forums, in which they detailed some feature of the game's development.{{cn|date=March 2020}} These included information about design philosophy, game mechanics that were being implemented, and features from ''Europa Universalis 3'' that were being removed.\n\nDuring its development, ''Europa Universalis IV'' had a greater priority given to stability and quality control than had previous games in the series.

There are also three e-books which have no impact on the game itself, but coincided with the release of expansions.\n\nExpansions are often accompanied by coinciding free patches to the game, which may adjust existing mechanics or add new ones in the theme of the expansion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n! style=\"width: 15%;height:50px;\" |Name\n! style=\"width: 15%;\" |Release date\n!Full Expansion\n!Description\n|-\n|'''''Conquest of Paradise'''''\n|11 January 2014\n|{{Ya}}\n|''Conquest of Paradise'' focuses on the [[New World]].
