He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]],'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]], and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]], and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=100, 102}} For the rest of the summer he focused on his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (''Le Rossignol''), based on the [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|same-titled story]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which he had started in 1908.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena).

For a while, he maintained a circle of contacts and [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] friends from Russia, but he eventually found that this did not sustain his intellectual and professional life. He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[George Balanchine]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. [[Bernard Holland]] claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Dylan Thomas]].

The texts and literary sources for his work began with a period of interest in [[Folklore|Russian folklore]], which progressed to classical authors and the [[Roman Rite|Latin liturgy]] and moved on to contemporary France ([[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], in ''[[Pers\u00e9phone (Stravinsky)|Persephone]]'') and eventually English literature, including [[W. H. Auden]], [[T. S.

Not only was he the principal composer for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but he also collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso]] (''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', 1920), [[Jean Cocteau]] (''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'', 1927), and [[George Balanchine]] ({{lang|fr|[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon musag\u00e8te]]}}, 1928).

Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as [[Coco Chanel]].

He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=51}} Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1966|pp=172\u201375}} Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:<blockquote>I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though I admire the structured thought of theology ([[St Anselm|Anselm]]'s proof in the ''[[Fides quaerens intellectum|Fides Quaerens Intellectum]]'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music.

In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.{{sfn|Satie|1923}} Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910. In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|Le Coq et l'Arlequin}}.{{sfn|Volta|1989|loc=first pages of chapter on contemporaries}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:\n<blockquote>All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war....

It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions.

Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]],'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]], and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home.

He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[George Balanchine]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. [[Bernard Holland]] claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Dylan Thomas]].

Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H.

This is a technique in which notes are removed from or added to a motif without regard to the consequent changes in metre. A similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century, for example in the music of [[Cipriano de Rore]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlandus Lassus]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]] and [[Giovanni de Macque]], music with which Stravinsky exhibited considerable familiarity.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nThe ''Rite of Spring'' is notable for its relentless use of [[ostinato|ostinati]], for example in the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight [[French horn|horns]] in the section \"Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)\".

Practically the whole lot are already on the shelf, and they will remain there until a few jaded neurotics once more feel a desire to eat ashes and fill their belly with the east wind.<ref>\"Occasional Notes\", ''[[The Musical Times and Singing-Class Circular]]'' 64, no. 968 (1 October 1923): 712\u201315, quotation on 713.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 597702 Composer Igor Stravinsky and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky with [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] in Moscow in September 1962]]\nIn 1935, the American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] compared Stravinsky to [[Jacopo Peri]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

In the 1960s, [[Korean people|Koreans]] began to arrive, and in the 1980s, [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] immigrants.
