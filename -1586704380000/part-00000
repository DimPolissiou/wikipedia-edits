''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]].

Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" />\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] shells;<ref name=scerri98>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=E.R. |title=The Evolution of the Periodic System |journal=Scientific American |date=1998 |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=78\u201383 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0998-78 |url=https://mipt.ru/dasr/upload/62f/f_brx2-arphh81ii9w.pdf}}</ref> this forms the basis of the modern [[octet rule]].

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]].

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, the English physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], a chemist, began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers.

Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015.

Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policetestguide.com/resources/police-officer-salary/ |title=Police Officer Salary \u2013 Police Test Guide &#124; Police Officer Test |publisher=Police Test Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref>  In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]]. On August 6, 2019, [[New Jersey Attorney General]] [[Gurbir Grewal]] announced creation of the first U.S. statewide program to support the [[mental health]] of police officers. The goal of the program would be to train officers in emotional resiliency and to help destigmatize mental health issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/37-nj-officers-have-killed-themselves-since-2016-ag-hopes-new-plan-will-prevent-suicides.html|title=37 N.J. officers have killed themselves since 2016.

Once Rahul ([[Yash Pathak]]) is born Mira's family forgives them. Akash has his own small business of travel. He is dedicated to working but would not earn money by cheating. On Rahul's first birthday Akash gives Mira the permission of inviting her family. At the venue, Mira's family comes along and Mira's brother ([[Manish Wadhwa]]) insults Akash to the core. This infuriates Akash and he hits Mira's brother. Mira asks Akash to apologise to her brother, which the former refuses. Mira's family forcibly takes her away from Akash.
