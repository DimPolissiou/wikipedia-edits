As a male myrtle warbler, this individual has a black \"mask\".]]\nThe yellow-rumped warbler breeds from eastern [[North America]] west to the Pacific, and southward from there into Western Mexico. \"Goldman's\" yellow-rumped warbler is a non-migratory endemic within the highlands of [[Guatemala]] and the black-fronted warbler is also a non-migratory Mexican endemic.<ref name=\"Toews et al. 2013\"/> The myrtle and Audubon's forms are [[bird migration|migratory]], traveling to the southern U.S., Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean for winters. Among warblers Audubon's is by far the most widespread in [[North America]] in winter, and in the northern and central parts of the continent, it is among the last to leave in the fall and among the first to return and is an occasional vagrant to the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]].\n\n==Habitat==\nYellow-rumped warblers spend the breeding season in mature coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous woodlands (such as in patches of [[aspen]], [[birch]], or [[willow]]). In the western U.S. and in the central [[Appalachian Mountains]], they are found mostly in mountainous areas. In the Pacific Northwest and the Northeastern U.S., they occur all the way down to sea level wherever conifers are present. During winter, yellow-rumped warblers find open areas with fruiting shrubs or scattered trees, such as parks, streamside woodlands, open pine and pine-oak forest, dunes (where bayberries are common), and residential areas. On their tropical wintering grounds they live in mangroves, thorn scrub, pine-oak-fir forests, and shade coffee plantations.<ref name= Cornell>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/yellow-rumped_warbler/lifehistory]</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThis is a mid-sized [[New World warbler]], though it is one of the largest species in the genus ''[[Setophaga]]'' (formerly ''Dendroica'') which comprises most of the species in the family. In total length, the species can range from {{convert|12|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a wingspan of {{convert|19|to|24|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Body mass can vary from {{convert|9.9|to|17.7|g|oz|abbr=on}}, though averages between {{convert|11|and|14|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Among standard measurements, the [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] is {{convert|6.3|to|8.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tail]] is {{convert|5|to|6.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[Beak|bill]] is {{convert|0.8|to|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] is {{convert|1.8|to|2.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>''New World Warblers (Helm Field Guides)'' by Jon Curson. Christopher Helm Publishers (1993). {{ISBN|978-0713639322}}.</ref> In summers, males of both forms have streaked backs of black on slate blue, white wing patches, a streaked breast, and conspicuous yellow patches on the crown, flank, and rump (the latter giving rise to the species's nickname \"butterbutt\" among birdwatchers<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taft|first1=Dave|title=Meet the Butter Butt, One Tough Bird|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/meet-the-butter-butt-one-tough-bird/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 9, 2016|date=October 31, 2014}}</ref>). Audubon's warbler also sports a yellow throat patch, while the myrtle warbler has a white throat and eye stripe, and a contrasting black cheek patch. Females of both forms are more dull, with brown streaking front and back, but still have noticeable yellow rumps. Goldman's warbler, of [[Guatemala]], resembles Audubon's but has a white lower border to the yellow throat and otherwise darker plumage; males replace the slate blue of Audubon's with black. Recently labeled \"butternuts\" by Oregon Wildlife photographer Tim Akimoff.\n\n==Behavior==\nAudubon's and the myrtle are among North America's most abundant neotropical migrants. They are primarily insectivorous. The species is perhaps the most versatile foragers of all warblers. Beyond gleaning from leaves like other New World warblers, they often flit, [[Tyrant flycatcher|flycatcher]]-like, out from their perches in short loops, to catch flying insects. Other places yellow-rumped warblers have been spotted foraging include picking at insects on washed-up seaweed at the beach, skimming insects from the surface of rivers and the ocean, picking them out of spiderwebs, and grabbing them off piles of manure. Common foods include [[caterpillar]]s and other larvae, [[leaf beetle]]s, [[bark beetle]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[ant]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[aphid]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[caddisflies]], [[craneflies]], and [[gnat]]s, as well as [[spider]]s. They also eat [[spruce budworm]], a serious forest pest, during outbreaks.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nWhen bugs are scarce, the myrtle warbler also eats fruit, including the [[Myrica|wax-myrtle]] berries which gave it its name. It is the only warbler able to digest such waxy material. The ability to use these fruits allows it to winter farther north than other warblers, sometimes as far north as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Other commonly eaten fruits include [[juniper]] berries, [[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[Smilax|greenbrier]], [[grape]]s, [[Virginia creeper]] and [[dogwood]]. They eat wild seeds such as from beach grasses and [[goldenrod]], and they may come to feeders, where they'll take [[sunflower seed]]s, [[raisin]]s, [[peanut butter]], and [[suet]]. On their wintering grounds in Mexico they've been seen sipping the sweet honeydew liquid excreted by [[aphid]]s. Male yellow-rumped warblers tend to forage higher in the trees than females do. While foraging with other warbler species, they sometimes aggressively displace other species, including [[pine warbler]]s and [[Blackburnian warbler]]s.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nAudubon's and the myrtle nest in coniferous and mixed woodlands, and lay 4\u20135 eggs. Females build the nest, sometimes using material the male carries to her. The nest is a cup of twigs, pine needles, grasses, and rootlets. She may also use moose, horse, and deer hair, moss, and lichens. She lines this cup with fine hair and feathers, sometimes woven into the nest in such a way that they curl up and over the eggs. The nest takes about 10 days to build. Nests are located on the horizontal branch of a conifer, anywhere from {{convert|1.2|to|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. Tree species include [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[spruce]], [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]], [[pine]], [[Douglas-fir]], and [[larch]] or [[tamarack]]. They may build their nests far out on a main branch or tuck it close to the trunk in a secure fork of two or more branches. Occasionally nest are built in a deciduous tree such as a [[maple]], [[oak]] or [[birch]]. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days. Nestlings are helpless and naked at hatching but grow quickly. The young are brooded for 10 to 14 days, at which point they can fledge.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nThe yellow-rumped warbler has a trill-like song of 4\u20137 syllables (''{{not a typo|tyew-tyew-tyew-tyew, tew-tew-tew}}'') and an occasional ''check'' or ''chip'' call note.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Myrtle Warbler - Cambridge, MA 2007.jpg|\nFile:Myrtle Warbler - Virginia Beach, VA.jpg|Yellow-rumped warbler in fall/winter plumage, November 29, 2014.\nFile:Yellow rumped warbler - natures pics.jpg|\nFile:Yellow-rumpedWarbler-Audubons-28MAR2016.jpg|Male Audubon's in Sacramento, California.

As a male myrtle warbler, this individual has a black \"mask\".]]\nThe yellow-rumped warbler breeds from eastern [[North America]] west to the Pacific, and southward from there into Western Mexico. \"Goldman's\" yellow-rumped warbler is a non-migratory endemic within the highlands of [[Guatemala]] and the black-fronted warbler is also a non-migratory Mexican endemic.<ref name=\"Toews et al. 2013\"/> The myrtle and Audubon's forms are [[bird migration|migratory]], traveling to the southern U.S., Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean for winters. Among warblers Audubon's is by far the most widespread in [[North America]] in winter, and in the northern and central parts of the continent, it is among the last to leave in the fall and among the first to return and is an occasional vagrant to the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]].\n\n==Habitat==\nYellow-rumped warblers spend the breeding season in mature coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous woodlands (such as in patches of [[aspen]], [[birch]], or [[willow]]). In the western U.S. and in the central [[Appalachian Mountains]], they are found mostly in mountainous areas. In the Pacific Northwest and the Northeastern U.S., they occur all the way down to sea level wherever conifers are present. During winter, yellow-rumped warblers find open areas with fruiting shrubs or scattered trees, such as parks, streamside woodlands, open pine and pine-oak forest, dunes (where bayberries are common), and residential areas. On their tropical wintering grounds they live in mangroves, thorn scrub, pine-oak-fir forests, and shade coffee plantations.<ref name= Cornell>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/yellow-rumped_warbler/lifehistory]</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThis is a mid-sized [[New World warbler]], though it is one of the largest species in the genus ''[[Setophaga]]'' (formerly ''Dendroica'') which comprises most of the species in the family. In total length, the species can range from {{convert|12|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a wingspan of {{convert|19|to|24|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Body mass can vary from {{convert|9.9|to|17.7|g|oz|abbr=on}}, though averages between {{convert|11|and|14|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Among standard measurements, the [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] is {{convert|6.3|to|8.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tail]] is {{convert|5|to|6.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[Beak|bill]] is {{convert|0.8|to|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] is {{convert|1.8|to|2.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>''New World Warblers (Helm Field Guides)'' by Jon Curson. Christopher Helm Publishers (1993). {{ISBN|978-0713639322}}.</ref> In summers, males of both forms have streaked backs of black on slate blue, white wing patches, a streaked breast, and conspicuous yellow patches on the crown, flank, and rump (the latter giving rise to the species's nickname \"butterbutt\" among birdwatchers<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taft|first1=Dave|title=Meet the Butter Butt, One Tough Bird|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/meet-the-butter-butt-one-tough-bird/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 9, 2016|date=October 31, 2014}}</ref>). Audubon's warbler also sports a yellow throat patch, while the myrtle warbler has a white throat and eye stripe, and a contrasting black cheek patch. Females of both forms are more dull, with brown streaking front and back, but still have noticeable yellow rumps. Goldman's warbler, of [[Guatemala]], resembles Audubon's but has a white lower border to the yellow throat and otherwise darker plumage; males replace the slate blue of Audubon's with black.\n\n==Behavior==\nAudubon's and the myrtle are among North America's most abundant neotropical migrants. They are primarily insectivorous. The species is perhaps the most versatile foragers of all warblers. Beyond gleaning from leaves like other New World warblers, they often flit, [[Tyrant flycatcher|flycatcher]]-like, out from their perches in short loops, to catch flying insects. Other places yellow-rumped warblers have been spotted foraging include picking at insects on washed-up seaweed at the beach, skimming insects from the surface of rivers and the ocean, picking them out of spiderwebs, and grabbing them off piles of manure. Common foods include [[caterpillar]]s and other larvae, [[leaf beetle]]s, [[bark beetle]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[ant]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[aphid]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[caddisflies]], [[craneflies]], and [[gnat]]s, as well as [[spider]]s. They also eat [[spruce budworm]], a serious forest pest, during outbreaks.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nWhen bugs are scarce, the myrtle warbler also eats fruit, including the [[Myrica|wax-myrtle]] berries which gave it its name. It is the only warbler able to digest such waxy material. The ability to use these fruits allows it to winter farther north than other warblers, sometimes as far north as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Other commonly eaten fruits include [[juniper]] berries, [[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[Smilax|greenbrier]], [[grape]]s, [[Virginia creeper]] and [[dogwood]]. They eat wild seeds such as from beach grasses and [[goldenrod]], and they may come to feeders, where they'll take [[sunflower seed]]s, [[raisin]]s, [[peanut butter]], and [[suet]]. On their wintering grounds in Mexico they've been seen sipping the sweet honeydew liquid excreted by [[aphid]]s. Male yellow-rumped warblers tend to forage higher in the trees than females do. While foraging with other warbler species, they sometimes aggressively displace other species, including [[pine warbler]]s and [[Blackburnian warbler]]s.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nAudubon's and the myrtle nest in coniferous and mixed woodlands, and lay 4\u20135 eggs. Females build the nest, sometimes using material the male carries to her. The nest is a cup of twigs, pine needles, grasses, and rootlets. She may also use moose, horse, and deer hair, moss, and lichens. She lines this cup with fine hair and feathers, sometimes woven into the nest in such a way that they curl up and over the eggs. The nest takes about 10 days to build. Nests are located on the horizontal branch of a conifer, anywhere from {{convert|1.2|to|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. Tree species include [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[spruce]], [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]], [[pine]], [[Douglas-fir]], and [[larch]] or [[tamarack]]. They may build their nests far out on a main branch or tuck it close to the trunk in a secure fork of two or more branches. Occasionally nest are built in a deciduous tree such as a [[maple]], [[oak]] or [[birch]]. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days. Nestlings are helpless and naked at hatching but grow quickly. The young are brooded for 10 to 14 days, at which point they can fledge.<ref name= Cornell/>\n\nThe yellow-rumped warbler has a trill-like song of 4\u20137 syllables (''{{not a typo|tyew-tyew-tyew-tyew, tew-tew-tew}}'') and an occasional ''check'' or ''chip'' call note.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Myrtle Warbler - Cambridge, MA 2007.jpg|\nFile:Myrtle Warbler - Virginia Beach, VA.jpg|Yellow-rumped warbler in fall/winter plumage, November 29, 2014.\nFile:Yellow rumped warbler - natures pics.jpg|\nFile:Yellow-rumpedWarbler-Audubons-28MAR2016.jpg|Male Audubon's in Sacramento, California.

Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the \"new city\" of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but various sources give some details. According to [[Justin (historian) |Justin]] (2nd century AD), Princess Elissa was the daughter of King [[Belus (Tyre) | Belus II]] of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her brother, Pygmalion, and her. She married her uncle [[Acerbas]], also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between the religious \u00e9lite and the monarchy. Pygmalion was a tyrant, a lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acerbas.<ref name=\"Aubet2001215\">{{cite book|author= Maria Eugenia Aubet|title= The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B7SLWT2vpNcC&pg=PA215|date= 6 September 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-79543-2|page=215}}</ref> Pygmalion assassinated Acerbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.\n\nVirgil's Roman epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', first introduces Queen Dido (the Greek name for Elissa) as a highly esteemed character. In just seven years since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have built a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Virgil portrays her character as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who had recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger-god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology) |Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to [[Founding of Rome | found Rome]]. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas farewells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lies dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\",<ref>4.625, trans. Fitzgerald.</ref> she says (an invocation of [[Hannibal]]). Aeneas goes on to found the predecessor-state of the [[Roman Kingdom]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city Dido had founded, an attitude exemplified by [[Cato the Elder]]'s much-repeated utterance, \"''[[Carthago delenda est]]''\", \"Carthage must be destroyed\".<ref>Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16</ref>\n\n===Phoenician settlement===\nThe Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hodos|first= Tamar|title= Colonial Engagements in the Global Mediterranean Iron Age|journal= Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date= June 2009|volume= 19|issue= 2|pages= 221\u2013241|doi= 10.1017/S0959774309000286|hdl= 1983/49da5a29-8176-4afb-a4c9-bc4a118e216f}}</ref> to provide safe harbors for their merchant fleets,<ref name=\"Martin2007\">{{cite book|author= Susan Rebecca Martin|title= 'Hellenization' and Southern Phoenicia: Reconsidering the Impact of Greece Before Alexander|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m2k_8JtTgsAC|accessdate= 22 February 2013|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-549-52890-6|page=115}}</ref> to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resources, and to conduct trade free of outside interference.<ref name=\"Graham2001\">{{cite book|author= A.

A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.\n\nHiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.\n\nAs a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.\n\nThe Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]].<ref name=\"Boardman2001\">{{cite book|author=John Boardman|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Roman World|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00john_1|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=18 January 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-285436-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00john_1/page/27 27]}}</ref> Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization.

Other mounted troops included [[North African elephant]]s (now extinct), trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anticavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army.

In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).<ref name=\"Lange2004\">{{cite book|author=Dierk Lange|title=Ancient Kingdoms of West Africa: Africa-centred and Canaanite-Israelite Perspectives : a Collection of Published and Unpublished Studies in English and French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=J.H.R\u00f6ll Verlag|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3|page=278}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus wrote an account about 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.<ref name=\"Mokhtar1981\">{{cite book|author=G.

In just seven years since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have built a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Virgil portrays her character as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who had recently escaped from [[Troy]].

However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]</ref><ref name=\"Tucker2009\">{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its [[sphere of influence]], bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\n===Punic Wars===\n{{further|Punic Wars|First Punic War|Mercenary War|Second Punic War|Third Punic War}}\n{{Punic Wars}}\n[[File:CarthageElectrumCoin250BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Carthage [[electrum]] coin, c. 250 BC.

An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed.

In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).<ref name=\"Lange2004\">{{cite book|author=Dierk Lange|title=Ancient Kingdoms of West Africa: Africa-centred and Canaanite-Israelite Perspectives : a Collection of Published and Unpublished Studies in English and French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=J.H.R\u00f6ll Verlag|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3|page=278}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus wrote an account about 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.<ref name=\"Mokhtar1981\">{{cite book|author=G.

A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.\n\nSurviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices.

There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.\n\nAccounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba\u02bfal Hammon and Tanit in the\ntophet.<ref name=\"Miles2011\">{{cite book|author=Richard Miles|title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOQ9JLtGj0UC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-51703-1|page=1797}}</ref> The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own.

Set around the time of the [[Mercenary War]], it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed. [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[silent film]] ''[[Cabiria]]'' is narrowly based on Flaubert's novel.\n\n''The Young Carthaginian'' (1887) by [[G. A.

It is a fictional account of life in Carthage and includes the defeat of Hannibal by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama.

In these books, Carthage is dominated by Germanic tribes, and the premise is that the [[Visigoths]] conquered Carthage and set up a huge empire that repelled the Muslim conquest.

Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.  The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

In France, constituencies are divided in proportion to their population, based on 1986 census figures, each consisted of 108,000 inhabitants. In theory, the number of total constituencies located within a d\u00e9partement is supposed to be proportional to the larger population within that d\u00e9partement compared to the total population of France. (In total, there are 101 d\u00e9partements, which are grouped into 22 [[Metropolitan France|metropolitan]] and five [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas]] [[regions of France|region]]s.)  However, using [[Republicanism#French and Swiss thought|French Republican tradition]], each d\u00e9partement must have at least two constituencies regardless of population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This, however, distorts the proportionality of national representation, with 23 d\u00e9partements being under-represented (including 5 of \"two deputies\" d\u00e9partements) and 28 d\u00e9partements over-represented.  Effectively, 51 out of 101 d\u00e9partements were poorly represented based on the results of the [[Census in France|most recent census]]. \n{{Quote box\n |quote  = A review of electoral boundaries will be conducted, based on demographic changes, after the second general census of the population following the previous border definition.\n |width  = 25%\n |align  = left\n |quoted = 1\n |source = '''''Article 2, Law No. 86-825 of 11 July 1986'''''\n}}\nFor instance, judging by representation in the National Assembly, the vote of someone in [[Loz\u00e8re]] is worth more than three times the vote of someone in [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]; three votes in [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]] is worth five votes in [[R\u00e9union]]; and three votes in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] is equivalent to five [[Haute-Garonne]].  The 25 most populous d\u00e9partements{{spaced ndash}}which together hold more than 50% of the French population{{spaced ndash}}have one deputy in the National Assembly for every 114,512 inhabitants, while the 25 least populated d\u00e9partements have one deputy for every 80,220 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  This results in a ratio between the most and the least populated of 143 to 100, or, five residents for the smaller d\u00e9partements are worth seven resident in the major d\u00e9partements. The situation is exacerbated by demographic trends in the 1990s and their resulting disparities within d\u00e9partements. For example, in the [[Var (department)|Var]], the population of the [[Constituency (France)#Var - 7 seats|1st constituency]] (the southern city of [[Toulon]]) was 73,946 inhabitants while that of the [[Constituency (France)#Var - 7 seats|6th constituency]] ([[Brignoles]]) was 180,153 inhabitants, resulting in a ratio of 1 to 2.44. These causes result in the most extreme expression of representational inequality, where the votes of two people living in the least-populated constituency of France (excluding overseas communities), Loz\u00e8re\u2019s [[2nd constituency]], weigh as much as eleven people in the most populous constituency, [[Val-d'Oise]]\u2019s [[Constituency (France)#Val-d.27Oise - 9 seats|2nd constituency]].\n\nIn observations made in May 2003 regarding the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 parliamentary elections]] as well as in July 2005 relating the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2007, the Constitutional Council highlighted the need to reshape electoral constituencies to better align with the principle of [[Suffrage#Equal suffrage|equal suffrage]]. The Council found disparities in representation resulting from the boundaries that were adopted in 1986 on the basis of population figures from the census of 1982.  According to the Council, the constituencies were \"incompatible with the combined clauses of Article 6 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 and Articles 3 and 24 of the [[Constitution of France]],\" even though two national censuses took place in 1990 and 1999.<ref name=\"MoI\">{{cite news|title= ORDONNANCE portant r\u00e9partition des si\u00e8ges et d\u00e9limitation des circonscriptions pour l\u2019\u00e9lection des d\u00e9put\u00e9s|url= http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/Ordonnance_Repartition_sieges_et_delimitation_circonscriptions.pdf|work= French Ministry of the Interior|language= French|accessdate= 2011-07-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111008002504/http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/Ordonnance_Repartition_sieges_et_delimitation_circonscriptions.pdf|archive-date= 2011-10-08|url-status= dead}}</ref>  However, the successive governments of [[Lionel Jospin]], [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], [[Dominique de Villepin]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]] did not alter electoral boundaries, despite the legal requirement of Law No. 86-825 as well as the recommendations of the [[Constitutional Council of France]]. Thus, even the [[2007 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 2007]] used conscriptions defined based on the results of the 1982 census and had not incorporated the changes in population occurring in the intervening 25 years.  The [[List of French Senators (2008-2011)|2008 election of senators]] used the same 1982 population numbers, but the impact is not as pronounced in the [[French Senate]] (''S\u00e9nat''), as its function is to represent local governments and not the population as a whole.\n\n== 2005 report on redistricting ==\nIn March 2005, [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] Dominique de Villepin formed a working group in order to assess the legal impact carrying out a redistricting of legislative districts and townships and to define a method that whereby any redistricting would be conducted in compliance with three legal requirements of \"neutrality, transparency and fairness.\"<ref name=\"lemonde1\">{{cite news |title=En 2005, un rapport pr\u00e9conisait le remodelage des circonscriptions avant les l\u00e9gislatives de 2007 |url=http://gaucheoc.canalblog.com/archives/2007/06/07/5219706.html |work=[[Le Monde]] |language=French |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>  Three months later, [[Councillor of State (France)|State Councillor]] [[Pierre Bordry]] issued his report to Dominique de Villepin - then the prime minister - and the new Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy. However, due to the very sensitive political nature of redistricting, neither de Villepin nor Sarkozy wanted to take the risk of subjecting the changing of constituencies borders to political wrangling ahead of the 2007 legislative elections. In fact, the former president of the Constitutional Council, [[Pierre Mazeaud]], even threatened to void the elections results of the constituencies that would be changed.<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The combination of differences between districts and the disparity of representation between d\u00e9partments makes the risk of seeing one minority party or a minority coalition party gather a majority of seats in the National Assembly less theoretical and more of a reality.\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n |quoted = 1\n |source = '''''June 2005 report by Pierre Bordry'''''<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n}}\nAfter the 2002 legislative elections, the Constitutional Council pointed out that since 1986, two national censuses occurred in 1990 and 1999 and disparities in representation were revealed that contradicted the constitutional principle that the National Assembly should be elected on the basis of population proportion.  Also, the electoral law of 1986 specified that the population differences between districts should not result that a constituency is more than 20% of the average population of districts of the d\u00e9partment. But the report noted that, based on the [[Demographics of France|1999 national census]], 25 districts had a difference of more than 20%.  A total of 41 d\u00e9partments (both in the [[Metropolitan France|M\u00e9tropole]] and overseas) were affected by \"major imbalances\" between districts.\n\nThe electoral law of 1986 specifies that the population differences between districts shall in no case result that a constituency is more than 20% of the average population of districts of the department. But the report noted that, based on the 1999 national census, 25 districts had a difference of more than 20%. The report proposed maintaining the number of constituencies at 577, but this time select a target maximum of 10% deviation in population in relation to the departmental average. According to the method of distribution segments of the population, a parliamentary seat would be awarded for every 116,200 inhabitants instead of for every 108,000 inhabitants, as was the case in the 1986 redistricting. However, the report did not assess the current law that a d\u00e9partment cannot have less than two members.<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n\n== Creating the commission ==\nIn 2008, at the behest of [[President of France|President]] Nicolas Sarkozy, [[Alain Marleix]] initiated a plan to redraw French constituencies in order to replace the previous constituency map from 1986.

Thus, the previous proportioning of 108,000 inhabitants per constituency in 1986 consideration was raised to 125,000 inhabitants per constituency. The principle of territorial contiguity of constituencies was retained (except for a few enclaves), as well as the contiguity of cantons and communes. The changing of constituencies was planned by order of the Interior Ministry<ref name=\"MoI\"/> and was controlled by an ad hoc committee composed of one person appointed by the French President, a one-person appointed by the [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], one person appointed by the [[List of Presidents of the French Senate|President of the Senate]], and three [[Judiciary of France|judges]].

The 25 most populous d\u00e9partements{{spaced ndash}}which together hold more than 50% of the French population{{spaced ndash}}have one deputy in the National Assembly for every 114,512 inhabitants, while the 25 least populated d\u00e9partements have one deputy for every 80,220 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  This results in a ratio between the most and the least populated of 143 to 100, or, five residents for the smaller d\u00e9partements are worth seven resident in the major d\u00e9partements. The situation is exacerbated by demographic trends in the 1990s and their resulting disparities within d\u00e9partements. For example, in the [[Var (department)|Var]], the population of the [[Constituency (France)#Var - 7 seats|1st constituency]] (the southern city of [[Toulon]]) was 73,946 inhabitants while that of the [[Constituency (France)#Var - 7 seats|6th constituency]] ([[Brignoles]]) was 180,153 inhabitants, resulting in a ratio of 1 to 2.44. These causes result in the most extreme expression of representational inequality, where the votes of two people living in the least-populated constituency of France (excluding overseas communities), Loz\u00e8re\u2019s [[2nd constituency]], weigh as much as eleven people in the most populous constituency, [[Val-d'Oise]]\u2019s [[Constituency (France)#Val-d.27Oise - 9 seats|2nd constituency]].\n\nIn observations made in May 2003 regarding the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 parliamentary elections]] as well as in July 2005 relating the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2007, the Constitutional Council highlighted the need to reshape electoral constituencies to better align with the principle of [[Suffrage#Equal suffrage|equal suffrage]]. The Council found disparities in representation resulting from the boundaries that were adopted in 1986 on the basis of population figures from the census of 1982.  According to the Council, the constituencies were \"incompatible with the combined clauses of Article 6 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 and Articles 3 and 24 of the [[Constitution of France]],\" even though two national censuses took place in 1990 and 1999.<ref name=\"MoI\">{{cite news|title= ORDONNANCE portant r\u00e9partition des si\u00e8ges et d\u00e9limitation des circonscriptions pour l\u2019\u00e9lection des d\u00e9put\u00e9s|url= http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/Ordonnance_Repartition_sieges_et_delimitation_circonscriptions.pdf|work= French Ministry of the Interior|language= French|accessdate= 2011-07-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111008002504/http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/Ordonnance_Repartition_sieges_et_delimitation_circonscriptions.pdf|archive-date= 2011-10-08|url-status= dead}}</ref>  However, the successive governments of [[Lionel Jospin]], [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], [[Dominique de Villepin]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]] did not alter electoral boundaries, despite the legal requirement of Law No. 86-825 as well as the recommendations of the [[Constitutional Council of France]]. Thus, even the [[2007 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 2007]] used conscriptions defined based on the results of the 1982 census and had not incorporated the changes in population occurring in the intervening 25 years.

However, due to the very sensitive political nature of redistricting, neither de Villepin nor Sarkozy wanted to take the risk of subjecting the changing of constituencies borders to political wrangling ahead of the 2007 legislative elections. In fact, the former president of the Constitutional Council, [[Pierre Mazeaud]], even threatened to void the elections results of the constituencies that would be changed.<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The combination of differences between districts and the disparity of representation between d\u00e9partments makes the risk of seeing one minority party or a minority coalition party gather a majority of seats in the National Assembly less theoretical and more of a reality.\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n |quoted = 1\n |source = '''''June 2005 report by Pierre Bordry'''''<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n}}\nAfter the 2002 legislative elections, the Constitutional Council pointed out that since 1986, two national censuses occurred in 1990 and 1999 and disparities in representation were revealed that contradicted the constitutional principle that the National Assembly should be elected on the basis of population proportion.  Also, the electoral law of 1986 specified that the population differences between districts should not result that a constituency is more than 20% of the average population of districts of the d\u00e9partment. But the report noted that, based on the [[Demographics of France|1999 national census]], 25 districts had a difference of more than 20%.  A total of 41 d\u00e9partments (both in the [[Metropolitan France|M\u00e9tropole]] and overseas) were affected by \"major imbalances\" between districts.\n\nThe electoral law of 1986 specifies that the population differences between districts shall in no case result that a constituency is more than 20% of the average population of districts of the department. But the report noted that, based on the 1999 national census, 25 districts had a difference of more than 20%. The report proposed maintaining the number of constituencies at 577, but this time select a target maximum of 10% deviation in population in relation to the departmental average. According to the method of distribution segments of the population, a parliamentary seat would be awarded for every 116,200 inhabitants instead of for every 108,000 inhabitants, as was the case in the 1986 redistricting. However, the report did not assess the current law that a d\u00e9partment cannot have less than two members.<ref name=\"lemonde1\"/>\n\n== Creating the commission ==\nIn 2008, at the behest of [[President of France|President]] Nicolas Sarkozy, [[Alain Marleix]] initiated a plan to redraw French constituencies in order to replace the previous constituency map from 1986.

The principle of territorial contiguity of constituencies was retained (except for a few enclaves), as well as the contiguity of cantons and communes.

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media.

The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media.

The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

D'autres traits phonologiques (tels le rhotacisme du -n- intervocalique : LUNA > ''lura'' en Oisans et ''luro'' en Brian\u00e7onnais) laissent deviner une importante communication vers le Brian\u00e7onnais, non seulement par le [[Lautaret]] mais aussi vers [[Vallouise]]. \n-->\n\n== Winter sport resorts ==\n[[File:Massif.Oisans.vue.depuis.La.Morte.Isere.01.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Oisans mountains seen from [[La Morte]] ([[Is\u00e8re]])]]\n* [[Alpe d'Huez|L'Alpe d'Huez]]\n* [[Les Deux Alpes]]\n* [[Auris, Is\u00e8re|Auris-en-Oisans]]\n* [[la Grave]] - [[Meije|la Meije]]\n* [[Villard-Reculas]]\n* [[Oz (Is\u00e8re)|Oz-en-Oisans]]\n* [[Ornon|Le Col d'Ornon]]\n* [[Mont-de-Lans]]\n* [[Vaujany]]\n* [[la Garde (Is\u00e8re)|La Garde-en-Oisans]] \n* [[Venosc]]\n\n== Villages in Oisans ==\n* [[Le Bourg-d'Oisans]]\n* [[Livet-et-Gavet]]\n* [[Allemond]]\n* [[Le Freney-d'Oisans]]\n* [[Mizoen]]\n* [[Clavans-en-Haut-Oisans]]\n* [[Oulles]]\n* [[Ornon]]\n* [[Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans]]\n* [[Besse-en-Oisans]]\n* [[Villard-Notre-Dame]]\n* [[Villard-Reymond]]\n* [[Villar-d'Ar\u00eane]]\n* [[Huez]]\n* [[Venosc]]\n* [[La Grave]]\n* [[Vaujany]]\n* [[La Garde (Is\u00e8re)|La Garde]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mountains|France}}\n* [[Parc national des \u00c9crins]]\n* [[Massif des \u00c9crins]]\n==External links==\n* [http://www.oisans.com oisans.com]\n* [http://www.tourisme-oisans.com/ tourisme oisans]\n* [http://www.bike-oisans.com/ bike Oisans]\n[[Category:Landforms of Hautes-Alpes]]\n[[Category:Valleys of France]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]\n", "name_user": "Jmg38", "label": "safe", "comment": "no pipe", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oisans"}
