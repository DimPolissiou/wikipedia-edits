Shani has also been raising her spirited son Jomo, a very energetic young elephant who just wants to play with the other animals, such as lechwes and [[baboons]].\n\nWhen the land is about to dry up, Gaia leads the elephants to an almost dry waterhole to enjoy the mud before leaving the desert. They are soon joined by other elephants who visit, play, and drink from the water. When the water dries up, Gaia notices a baby elephant suffocating and stuck in the mud, so she goes to its rescue, and the baby is reunited with its mother. \n\nThe Herd leaves the desert to join the other elephants on the long journey, they take a lunch break to have a family reunion with other herds of elephants, with some not seeing Gaia for over a year. Jomo starts making new friends with the other baby elephants, and for ages, Shani reunites with many of her long lost cousins. Gaia's herd and other herds of elephants have no luck trying to find food, but a male elephant (who is visiting his family) uses his trunk to drop a bunch of seedpods from trees. Everyone munches happily.\n\nGaia's herd comes across ancient paths that their ancestors created when they migrated. When they've reached a dry waterhole, they noticed an elephant skeleton. Shani shows a confused Jomo a life lesson. The herd moves on and finds another waterhole (this time with water). As the elephants drink, Jomo plays with a group of [[warthogs]]. The water is ruined by its previous visitors, so the elephants munch on Mopani trees but are chased off by caterpillars eating the entire trees.\n\nThe Herd continues their journey to a small little island. There is no water for them to drink, but Gaia leads her herd to Baobab trees which they could drink water from its sap. Shani teaches the young elephants how to get sap by ripping the thick bark. The Herd rests on the island for the night.\n\nContinuing their journey, the Herd trudges through sand storms. Shani and Gaia sense the ground trembling, which meant a river close by, but they are despaired when they reach the river. It is far below the cliffs where the elephants are, but thanks to the help of a flock of Quelea birds, the herd makes their way to [[Victoria Falls]], the place that Gaia has been searching for. The Herd happily drinks, but are soon confronted by [[crocodiles]]. Luckily no one was hurt when they crossed the river. They reach the islands, and The Herd enjoys their times in Victoria Falls and even munch on [[Palm nuts]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the highlands of [[Angola]], rain starts to pour, which means the water is going off to the [[Okavango Delta]], Shani and Jomo's home.\n\nSoon after, Gaia starts to get tired and weak and finds the food hard to eat. She and The Herd start making their way back to Okavango. Shani helps Gaia gather the herd, with Jomo by their side. Gaia realizes that the Angolan falls are early, and she and Shani immediately gather the herd to use the shortest route, but they soon find themselves confronted by a pride of [[Lions]]. As the elephants settle in for the night, the lions attack Jomo, but he is saved by Shani. But by morning, Gaia dies, with the herd sharing a heartbreaking goodbye to their great matriarch, while the lions share their feast. Shani finds her leadership to the other elephants difficult. A week later, an elephant gives birth to a newborn baby calf. Jomo is unimpressed, but soon lets go of being the baby of the family and warms up to his new little playmate.\n\nShani soon uses Gaia's memories, and begins to lead the herd back to the Delta. They are soon confronted by a rival herd of elephants, who are going after the newborn calf. Shani stands her ground at the rival matriarch, and the rival herd retreats. They make their way home to Okavango, where the land is bursting back to life. The Herd soon accepts Shani as the new matriarch, while Jomo teaches his new little playmate how to play with the other animals.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|12036052}}\n* {{Disney+ movie}}\n\n{{Disney+ Films}}\n{{Disneynature}}\n\n[[Category:2020 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Disneynature films]]\n[[Category:Disney+ original films]]\n[[Category:Films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Linfield]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n{{nature-documentary-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Film about elephants}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Elephant\n| image          = Elephant - official release poster.jpg\n| caption        = Official release poster\n| director       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Mark Linfield]]\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n}}\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Linfield\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n* [[Roy Conli]]\n}}\n| writer         = \n| narrator       = [[Meghan Markle]]\n| music          = [[Ramin Djawadi]]\n| cinematography = {{Plainlist|\n* Martyn Colbeck\n* Mike Holding\n* Tom Walker\n}}\n| editing        = \n| studio         = [[Disneynature]]\n| distributor    = [[Disney+]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2020|04|03}}\n| runtime        = 89 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Elephant''''' is an American [[Nature documentary|nature documentary]] film about [[Elephant|elephants]] directed by [[Mark Linfield]] and Vanessa Berlowitz and narrated by [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]].<ref>https://dtcimedia.disney.com/news/earth-month-disneynature-2020</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/meghan-markle-disney-plus-elephants-1203545835/|title=Meghan Markle Narrating Disney Plus Nature Documentary \u2018Elephants\u2019|website=Variety|last=Vary|first=Adam B.|date=March 26, 2020|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> It is the fifteenth nature documentary to be released under the [[Disneynature]] label.

The station is on the [[Ipswich\u2013Ely line]] and all trains calling there are operated by [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early History (1845-1862)===\nThe Ipswich and Bury Railway Company (I&BR), was formed to build a line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds. Its Act of 21 July 1845 authorised capital of \u00a3400,000 and it shared many shareholders and directors with the [[Eastern Union Railway]] (EUR) who were in the process of building their line from Colchester to Ipswich. The companies also shared the same head office location in Brook Street, Ipswich.\n\nThe proposed line was {{convert|26.5|mi}} long, with intermediate stations at [[Bramford railway station|Bramford]], [[Claydon railway station|Claydon]], [[Needham Market railway station|Needham]], [[Stowmarket railway station|Stowmarket]], [[Haughley Road railway station|Haughley Road]], [[Elmswell railway station|Elmswell]] and [[Thurston railway station|Thurston]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=49\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe ground breaking ceremony took place in Ipswich on 1 August 1845 where twelve local worthies (including the mayor of Ipswich, engineer [[Peter Bruff]] and John Chevallier Cobbold) each filled a wheelbarrow with soil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=54\u201359}}</ref> Building the line was challenging with problems at Ipswich with tunnel construction and at Stowmarket where the local marsh swallowed up a lot of material with test probes finding the bog was 80 feet deep!<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 November 1846 the first test train ran to a temporary station at Bury St Edmunds with stops at most stations on the route with the inevitable lavish celebrations.  The official opening followed on 7 December 1846 when a special train ran from Shoreditch (later Bishopsgate railway station) to Bury. The Board of Trade inspection took place on 15 December 1846 and the line opened for traffic on 24 December. The existing station at Bury opened in November 1847.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=66\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe EUR and I&BR were worked as one from 1 January 1847, and formal amalgamation was obtained by Act of 9 July 1847. The [[Eastern Union Railway]] was taken over by the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] in 1854. By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the [[Great Eastern Railway]] was formed by amalgamation. Thus Bury St Edmunds became a GER station in 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Adrian|title=Railwaymen, Politics and Money|year=1997|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=0 7195 5150 1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/railwaymenpoliti0000vaug/page/134 134, 135]|url=https://archive.org/details/railwaymenpoliti0000vaug/page/134}}</ref>\n\n===Great Eastern Railway (1862-1922)===\nThe line from Long Melford opened in 1865 and the line to Thetford opened in 1876.

As first built &ndash; as a terminus &ndash; the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains towards Cambridge or Peterborough) and Platform 2 (for trains towards Ipswich and Harwich International).<ref>{{cite book|author=Biddle, Gordon|title=Britain's Historic Railway Buildings|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866247-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk|journal=Great Eastern Journal|issue=106|pages=23\u20139|date=April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II [[listed building]], has been credited to [[Frederick Barnes (architect)|Frederick Barnes]] (who was a partner of Sancton Wood) and Charles Russell.\n\nThe two platforms are connected by a subway.\n\n===Goods facilities===\nA goods yard was situated on the down side west of the station.\n\n==Engine Shed==\nThe first engine shed was located immediately west of the railway station when Bury St Edmunds was a terminus station for the Ipswich and Bury Railway. The opening of the line to Cambridge in 1854 saw the end of this first shed as it was in the way of the new line. A new engine shed of wooden construction was established on the north side of the line again west of the station. This shed deteriorated over the years and inclement weather in 1901 finished the structure off. The Great Eastern Railway, often parsimonious in matters relating to the locomotive department, left it until 1904 before a new three-road brick built shed with a north-light roof was built.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|pages=267\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Ipswich district in 1914 the shed had 30 men under a fitter-in-charge. The allocation on 1 January 1922 consisted of:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|page=377}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The station is on the [[Ipswich\u2013Ely line]] and all trains calling there are operated by [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early History (1845-1862)===\nThe Ipswich and Bury Railway Company (I&BR), was formed to build a line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds. Its Act of 21 July 1845 authorised capital of \u00a3400,000 and it shared many shareholders and directors with the [[Eastern Union Railway]] (EUR) who were in the process of building their line from Colchester to Ipswich. The companies also shared the same head office location in Brook Street, Ipswich.\n\nThe proposed line was {{convert|26.5|mi}} long, with intermediate stations at [[Bramford railway station|Bramford]], [[Claydon railway station|Claydon]], [[Needham Market railway station|Needham]], [[Stowmarket railway station|Stowmarket]], [[Haughley Road railway station|Haughley Road]], [[Elmswell railway station|Elmswell]] and [[Thurston railway station|Thurston]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=49\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe ground breaking ceremony took place in Ipswich on 1 August 1845 where twelve local worthies (including the mayor of Ipswich, engineer [[Peter Bruff]] and John Chevallier Cobbold) each filled a wheelbarrow with soil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=54\u201359}}</ref> Building the line was challenging with problems at Ipswich with tunnel construction and at Stowmarket where the local marsh swallowed up a lot of material with test probes finding the bog was 80 feet deep!<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 November 1846 the first test train ran to a temporary station at Bury St Edmunds with stops at most stations on the route with the inevitable lavish celebrations.  The official opening followed on 7 December 1846 when a special train ran from Shoreditch (later Bishopsgate railway station) to Bury. The Board of Trade inspection took place on 15 December 1846 and the line opened for traffic on 24 December. The existing station at Bury opened in November 1847.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moffat|first1=Hugh|title=East Anglia's first railways|date=1987|publisher=Terence Dalton Limited|location=Lavenham|isbn=0 86138 038 X|pages=66\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe EUR and I&BR were worked as one from 1 January 1847, and formal amalgamation was obtained by Act of 9 July 1847. The [[Eastern Union Railway]] was taken over by the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] in 1854. By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the [[Great Eastern Railway]] was formed by amalgamation. Thus Bury St Edmunds became a GER station in 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Adrian|title=Railwaymen, Politics and Money|year=1997|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=0 7195 5150 1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/railwaymenpoliti0000vaug/page/134 134, 135]|url=https://archive.org/details/railwaymenpoliti0000vaug/page/134}}</ref>\n\n===Great Eastern Railway (1862-1922)===\nThe line from Long Melford opened in 1865 and the line to Thetford opened in 1876.

As first built &ndash; as a terminus &ndash; the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains towards Cambridge or Peterborough) and Platform 2 (for trains towards Ipswich and Harwich International).<ref>{{cite book|author=Biddle, Gordon|title=Britain's Historic Railway Buildings|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866247-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk|journal=Great Eastern Journal|issue=106|pages=23\u20139|date=April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II [[listed building]], has been credited to [[Frederick Barnes (architect)|Frederick Barnes]] (who was a partner of Sancton Wood) and Charles Russell.\n\nThe two platforms are connected by a subway.\n\n===Goods facilities===\nA goods yard was situated on the down side west of the station.\n\n==Engine Shed==\nThe first engine shed was located immediately west of the railway station when Bury St Edmunds was a terminus station for the Ipswich and Bury Railway. The opening of the line to Cambridge in 1854 saw the end of this first shed as it was in the way of the new line. A new engine shed of wooden construction was established on the north side of the line again west of the station. This shed deteriorated over the years and inclement weather in 1901 finished the structure off. The Great Eastern Railway, often parsimonious in matters relating to the locomotive department, left it until 1904 before a new three-road brick built shed with a north-light roof was built.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|pages=267\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Ipswich district in 1914 the shed had 30 men under a fitter-in-charge.
