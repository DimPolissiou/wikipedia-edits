The headquarters are in [[Wald-Michelbach]], [[Germany]]. The team currently competes in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] as '''Mazda Team Joest''' under a works contract with [[Mazda]].\n\n==Early years==\nAs a combined driver/team owner, Reinhold Joest first began to race a [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908/3]] in the [[European Sportscar Championship]], winning the driver's title. He then switched to [[Porsche 935]]s, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1980. The team won the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft|DRM]] back to back with driver [[Bob Wollek]], in 1982 and 1983. During the 1982 season, whilst the [[Porsche 956]] was only available to the works team, Joest adapted a roof onto a [[Porsche 936]] to enter the [[Group C]] [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]]. They would race the car into the 1983 season until they took delivery of their 956 prior to Le Mans.\n\n==Le Mans successes==\nIn [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]], in absence of the works team, Joest Racing would score the first of their thirteen wins at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Henri Pescarolo]] driving their \"lucky #7\" car a Porsche 956, chassis number 117. In [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]], the works team returned, and despite having little factory support, they defended their title with Ludwig, [[Paolo Barilla]] and incognito German businessman \"[[Louis Krages|John Winter]]\" driving the #7 chassis number 117 again. This would make them the second team to score back to back wins with the same car, the other being [[John Wyer|JW Automotive]] whose [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.I]] won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].\n\nIn 1986, 1988, and 1989 Joest won the [[Supercup]] title for teams and Wollek winning the drivers cup in 1989. They also took the [[Interserie]] title for drivers with Winter in 1985 and [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in 1991, and the teams title in 1991.\n[[Image:962 Joest 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joest Racing's [[Porsche 962]] which they used in the [[IMSA GT Championship]].]]\nIn 1989, [[FIA]] introduced the new 3.5 litre [[Formula One]] engine rule to Group C, which not many teams were happy about, because few, if any, such engines were available to privateer teams like Joest. The previous fuel economy based rules were gradually phased out in favour of short races with cars that were virtually two-seater Formula 1 cars; existing Group C cars such as Joest's Porsche 962s were given higher weights and lower fuel allocation to make them less competitive. The team would instead compete in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTP category]] beginning in 1990, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991 with Wollek, Pescarolo, [[Frank Jelinski]], \"Winter\" and [[Hurley Haywood]]. With their [[Porsche 962]] now being outmoded by the [[Nissan]]s, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]s and [[Toyota]]s, the team would not score any more victories. In 1993, the Nissan and [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] team had withdrawn, and the [[All American Racers|AAR Eagle]] [[Toyota]] would continue to dominate the series final year. Joest managed to score the car's last IMSA victory at the [[Road America 500]], due to Toyota's absence.\n\n==Joest and Opel==\nIn the 1990s, the team also had a successful career developing and racing an [[Opel Calibra]] in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM). They first won the ITR Gold Cup at the [[Donington Park]] round in 1994 with [[Manuel Reuter]] driving, when the leading [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] was disqualified for running out of fuel. They would continue to have a successful career there by the time the series became a full-fledged international championship (ITC), winning the title for the final year in 1996 for [[Opel]].\n\n==Return to Le Mans==\n[[Image:Porsche LMP1 '98 - WSC-002 No. 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise.]]\nIn late 1995, [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] were commissioned by Porsche to produce a [[World Sportscar Championship|WSC]] car to compete in the 1996 Daytona 24-hour race. The resulting [[Porsche WSC-95]] was based on the TWR's 1991  [[Jaguar XJR-14]] chassis, with the roof removed and a flat-six Porsche engine fitted. The car was withdrawn because of a sudden rule change. For 1996 the concept was revived and Joest were chosen to run the WSC-95s at [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] as backup for Porsche's own team of works [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1s]]. Joest won the race with [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]], [[Manuel Reuter]], and [[Alexander Wurz]]. They returned in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]], this time without works support, but again with the same car wearing #7. The winning pilots were by [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Stefan Johansson]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], the latter scoring the first of his nine wins. As with the #7 956 of the 1980s, Joest attempted for a third straight win, although without success, as neither car finished, while Porsche itself prevailed in the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998 race]].\n\n==Audi Sport Team Joest==\n[[File:Audi Sport Team Joest Tent Sebring 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Joest Racing team at work on their cars before dawn for the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]].]]\n[[Image:Audi R8 LeMans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joest's successful Audi R8, winner three years in a row.]]\nIn 1998, after being associated with Porsche for many years, the team signed a works contract with [[Audi]] (its CEO being [[Ferdinand Piech]], a grandson of Porsche) to support them for the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Joest helped them build and develop the [[Audi R8R]]. Audi, not being sure which concept was the better one, also supported an LM-GTP entry, the R8C, developed by [[Racing Technology Norfolk|RTN]]. While the British R8Cs never worked properly, the two Joest R8R were reliable, yet too slow to finish better than 3rd and 4th against one of the works [[BMW V12 LMR]] and a [[Toyota GT-One]].\n\nAudi and Joest went back to develop the highly successful R8, winning its maiden race at the [[2000 12 Hours of Sebring]], and going on the win at [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. Between 2000 and 2002, the R8 cars took a hat-trick of wins at Le Mans, Sebring, and [[Petit Le Mans]], as well as [[American Le Mans Series]] titles in each year.\n\nAudi scaled their sports car racing operation down at the end of 2002, preferring to focus their attention on the [[Bentley Speed 8]] for a year, allowing it to win in 2003 (with support by Joest mechanics).  In 2004, Audi returned to [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] [[touring car racing]], now officially backing up the [[Abt Sportsline]] effort which had been called \"private\" since 2000. Joest and Abt fielded [[Audi A4]]s in the series.\n\nIn 2006, Joest began racing the new [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10]] sports car. They began the 2006 season with a win at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and took also the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], replicating that performance [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|a year later]] and again in 2008, both times against Peugeot's diesel [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]] coupe.\n\nIn 2009, Joest and Audi introduced the [[Audi R15]] sports car, the replacement for the R10. However, reliability issues allowed Peugeot to finish first and second at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with their 908 HDi FAP which had been perfected over its three-year history.\n\nIn an answer to the 2009 issues, Audi reworked the R15 for 2010 (under the '''R15 TDI plus''' designation) with a higher reliability factor; unexpected Peugeot reliability issues of the 908 HDi FAP forced all four cars (including one by [[Oreca]]) to retire before the end of the race and resulted in a clean sweep of the podium in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with all three cars running farther than the former {{24hLM|1971}} race record, despite that the R15s were not using the V10 [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engines at full and were not running faster than the four 908s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |title=Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology |work=joest-racing.de; [[Audi#Motorsports|Audi Sport]] |publisher=Joest Racing |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050259/http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the [[Audi R18]] TDI won the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] despite the loss of 2 cars and a ferocious pace from the opposing Peugeots. The R18s failed to win any of the other races in the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] that year, however, handing the team and drive titles to Peugeot.\n\nFor the first part of 2012, with the collapse of the Peugeot racing program, Audi has run near-unopposed in the first races of the 2012 [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The R18 TDI won the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]] in its last race and its successor, the Audi R18 Ultra, won the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]] with the related R18 E-Tron Quattro finishing in 2nd place. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, Joest Racing Audis won the top 3 positions with two R18 E-Tron Quattros finishing 1st and 2nd and one Audi R18 Ultra taking 3rd.\n\nAfter Le Mans, Audi won 2 further rounds of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the [[2012 6 Hours of Silverstone]] and the [[2012 6 Hours of Bahrain]]. While handing the other three rounds to Toyota, Audi would win the LMP1 Manufacturer Championship 2012 and helped Andre Lotterer, Bernoit Treleuyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler to become Driver World Endurance Champions 2012.\n\nIn late 2016, [[Audi Sport]] announced that they would leave the FIA World Endurance Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/126838|title=Audi WEC Team confirms that they will not be returning to the World Endurance Championship for the 2017 Season.|last=|first=|date=11 November 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==GT3==\nAudi Sport Team Joest entered a pair of [[Audi R8#Motorsport|Audi R8 LMS GT3's]] in the [[2011 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2011 Bathurst 12 Hour]] held at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Australia]] on 6 February. Both cars qualified on the front row with the team of Marc Basseng, Christopher Mies and [[Darryl O'Young]] leading home Australian team mates Mark Eddy, [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Warren Luff]] in a 1-2 finish. With both cars on the same lap racing for the win, the margin was only 0.7141 between the two at the end of 12 hours of racing. The Joest Racing R8's finished one lap in front of the VIP Pet Foods Racing [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup R]] of [[Craig Baird]] and father and son pairing Tony and Klark Quinn.\n\nIt was Joest's 2nd win in Australia in two starts having previously won the ALMS [[Race of a Thousand Years]] on 31 December 2000 with [[Rinaldo Capello|Dindo Capello]] and [[Allan McNish]] winning in an [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] on the old [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Grand Prix circuit]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Capello easily put the R8 on pole position, while McNish was actually laid up with a bad back after he put it out when stepping out of his [[Kilt]] after a pre-event photo shoot. They also had to drive a repaired car after Capello put the crocodile liveried car into the tyre barriers in the race morning warm up session. Despite his troubles, McNish started the race and set the fastest lap. He also drove the 25 laps required and wrapped up the inaugural ALMS Drivers' title as a result.\n\n==Mazda Team Joest==\nOn 18 July 2017 it was announced that Joest Racing would take over the operation of the [[Riley Mk. 30#Mazda RT24-P|Mazda RT24-P]] [[Daytona Prototype#Daytona Prototype International|Daytona Prototype International]] (DPi) entry in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the [[2018 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2018]] season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2017/07/18/joest-to-take-over-mazda-dpi-programme.html |title=Joest To Take Over Mazda DPi Programme |work=dailysportscar.com|publisher=dailysportscar |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2017-07-19|}}</ref> Mazda withdrew from the remainder of the 2017 season in order for Joest to spearhead testing and development of the then uncompetitive DPi.\n\nThe partnership was terminated at the end of March 2020 with Mazda moving to Multimatic Motorsports.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.joest-racing.de}}\n\n{{Audi Sport Team Joest driver timeline}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joest Racing}}\n[[Category:German auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1978]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans teams]]\n[[Category:American Le Mans Series teams]]\n[[Category:FIA Sportscar Championship entrants]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters teams]]\n[[Category:British Touring Car Championship teams]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship teams]]\n[[Category:FIA World Endurance Championship teams]]\n[[Category:European Le Mans Series teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Auto racing team in Germany}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{update|date=March 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}\n}}\n\n<!--an official website link does not count-->\n{{Motor racing team\n| name           = {{flagicon|DEU}} Joest Racing\n| logo           = \n| founded        = 1978\n| principal      = [[Reinhold Joest]]\n| current series = [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]\n| former series  = [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] [[World Sportscar Championship]]<br>[[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]]<br>[[IMSA GT Championship]]<br>[[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]]<br>[[American Le Mans Series]]<br>[[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]]<br>[[Le Mans Series]]<br>[[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]]\n|current drivers        = {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Oliver Jarvis]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jonathan Bomarito]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tristan Nunez]]<br>{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Harry Tincknell]]<br>{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Olivier Pla]]<br>{{flagicon|GER}} [[Timo Bernhard]]\n| driver titles  = 6 ([[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'12 WEC]], [[2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'13 WEC]], '00, '01, '02, '03 [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]])\n| team titles    = 6 ([[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'12 WEC]], [[2013 FIA World Endurance Championship season|'13 WEC]], '00, '01, '02, '03 [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]])\n| folded         = \n}}\n\n'''Joest Racing''' is a [[sports car racing]] team that was established in 1978 by former [[Porsche]] works racer [[Reinhold Joest]]. The headquarters are in [[Wald-Michelbach]], [[Germany]]. The team currently competes in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] as '''Mazda Team Joest''' under a works contract with [[Mazda]].\n\n==Early years==\nAs a combined driver/team owner, Reinhold Joest first began to race a [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908/3]] in the [[European Sportscar Championship]], winning the driver's title. He then switched to [[Porsche 935]]s, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1980. The team won the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft|DRM]] back to back with driver [[Bob Wollek]], in 1982 and 1983. During the 1982 season, whilst the [[Porsche 956]] was only available to the works team, Joest adapted a roof onto a [[Porsche 936]] to enter the [[Group C]] [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]]. They would race the car into the 1983 season until they took delivery of their 956 prior to Le Mans.\n\n==Le Mans successes==\nIn [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]], in absence of the works team, Joest Racing would score the first of their thirteen wins at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Henri Pescarolo]] driving their \"lucky #7\" car a Porsche 956, chassis number 117. In [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]], the works team returned, and despite having little factory support, they defended their title with Ludwig, [[Paolo Barilla]] and incognito German businessman \"[[Louis Krages|John Winter]]\" driving the #7 chassis number 117 again. This would make them the second team to score back to back wins with the same car, the other being [[John Wyer|JW Automotive]] whose [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.I]] won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].\n\nIn 1986, 1988, and 1989 Joest won the [[Supercup]] title for teams and Wollek winning the drivers cup in 1989. They also took the [[Interserie]] title for drivers with Winter in 1985 and [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in 1991, and the teams title in 1991.\n[[Image:962 Joest 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joest Racing's [[Porsche 962]] which they used in the [[IMSA GT Championship]].]]\nIn 1989, [[FIA]] introduced the new 3.5 litre [[Formula One]] engine rule to Group C, which not many teams were happy about, because few, if any, such engines were available to privateer teams like Joest. The previous fuel economy based rules were gradually phased out in favour of short races with cars that were virtually two-seater Formula 1 cars; existing Group C cars such as Joest's Porsche 962s were given higher weights and lower fuel allocation to make them less competitive. The team would instead compete in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTP category]] beginning in 1990, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991 with Wollek, Pescarolo, [[Frank Jelinski]], \"Winter\" and [[Hurley Haywood]]. With their [[Porsche 962]] now being outmoded by the [[Nissan]]s, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]s and [[Toyota]]s, the team would not score any more victories. In 1993, the Nissan and [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] team had withdrawn, and the [[All American Racers|AAR Eagle]] [[Toyota]] would continue to dominate the series final year. Joest managed to score the car's last IMSA victory at the [[Road America 500]], due to Toyota's absence.\n\n==Joest and Opel==\nIn the 1990s, the team also had a successful career developing and racing an [[Opel Calibra]] in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM). They first won the ITR Gold Cup at the [[Donington Park]] round in 1994 with [[Manuel Reuter]] driving, when the leading [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] was disqualified for running out of fuel. They would continue to have a successful career there by the time the series became a full-fledged international championship (ITC), winning the title for the final year in 1996 for [[Opel]].\n\n==Return to Le Mans==\n[[Image:Porsche LMP1 '98 - WSC-002 No. 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise.]]\nIn late 1995, [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] were commissioned by Porsche to produce a [[World Sportscar Championship|WSC]] car to compete in the 1996 Daytona 24-hour race. The resulting [[Porsche WSC-95]] was based on the TWR's 1991  [[Jaguar XJR-14]] chassis, with the roof removed and a flat-six Porsche engine fitted. The car was withdrawn because of a sudden rule change. For 1996 the concept was revived and Joest were chosen to run the WSC-95s at [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] as backup for Porsche's own team of works [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1s]]. Joest won the race with [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]], [[Manuel Reuter]], and [[Alexander Wurz]]. They returned in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]], this time without works support, but again with the same car wearing #7. The winning pilots were by [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Stefan Johansson]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], the latter scoring the first of his nine wins. As with the #7 956 of the 1980s, Joest attempted for a third straight win, although without success, as neither car finished, while Porsche itself prevailed in the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998 race]].\n\n==Audi Sport Team Joest==\n[[File:Audi Sport Team Joest Tent Sebring 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Joest Racing team at work on their cars before dawn for the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]].]]\n[[Image:Audi R8 LeMans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joest's successful Audi R8, winner three years in a row.]]\nIn 1998, after being associated with Porsche for many years, the team signed a works contract with [[Audi]] (its CEO being [[Ferdinand Piech]], a grandson of Porsche) to support them for the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]].

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.

Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own side. \n\nIn the wake of the contested 1872 election for [[governor of Louisiana]] and local offices, a group of white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] armed with rifles and a small cannon, overpowered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[freedmen]] and state [[militia]] (also black) occupying the Grant Parish [[courthouse]] in Colfax.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\">[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877'', p. 437</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_colfax.html ''Ulysses S. Grant'', People and Events: \"The Colfax Massacre\", PBS Website], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref> Most of the [[freedmen]] were killed after they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153; three whites died but the number of black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] or removed for burial. There were rumors of mass graves at the site.\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P. Kellogg]] the victor. A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

On March 2, 1867, they passed the [[Reconstruction Act]], over Johnson's veto, which required that blacks be given the franchise\u2014in Southern states but not in Northern states\u2014and that reconstructed Southern states ratify the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] before admission to the Union.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Randall|first=J.

Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the [[Knights of the White Camelia]].<ref name=\"Lane\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Background in Grant Parish==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThe Red River area of Winn and Rapides parishes was a combination of large plantations and subsistence farmers; before the war, African Americans had worked as slaves on the plantations.{{cn|date=June 2019}} William Smith Calhoun, a major planter, had inherited a {{convert|14000|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation in the area.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 25</ref> A former slaveholder, he lived with a [[mixed-race]] woman as his common-law wife and had come to support black political equality.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn election day in November 1868, Calhoun led a group of freedmen to vote.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The ballot box was originally at a store owned by John Hooe,{{cn|date=June 2019}} who had threatened to whip freedmen \"if they voted Republican\".<ref> Lane 2008, p. 27</ref> Calhoun arranged for the ballot box to be switched to a plantation store owned by a Republican.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The Republicans received 318 votes, and the Democrats received 49.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 28</ref> A group of whites threw the ballot box into the Red River, and Democrats arrested Calhoun, alleging election fraud.{{cn|date=June 2019}} With the original ballot box gone, Democrat Michael Ryan went on to claimed a landslide victory.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41</ref>{{what|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe election was also marked by violence.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Election commissioner Hal Frazier, a black Republican, was murdered by whites.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41f</ref> After this, Calhoun drafted a bill to create a new parish out of parts of [[Winn Parish|Winn]] and [[Rapides Parish|Rapides]] parishes, which passed the Republican legislature; as a major planter, Calhoun thought he would have more political influence in the new parish, which had a black majority.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Other new parishes were created by the Republican state legislature to try to develop areas of Republican political support.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Enforcement against the Klan==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\nAccording to Lane, after [[Ulysses S.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBlack Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}\n\nSuch news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>\n\nThe exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities;<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=265}}</ref> a military report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&GSvcid=117316 Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed]</ref> and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \"at least 105\";<ref name=\"Lane 256-66\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=265\u201366}}</ref> a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colfax Riot Historical Marker|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|year=1950 |url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/Grant/Colfax+Riot.html}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:\n\n{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority. Among blacks in Louisiana, the incident was long remembered as proof that in any large confrontation, they stood at a fatal disadvantage.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/>}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The organization against them is too strong. ...\" Louisiana black teacher and Reconstruction legislator [[John G. Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.

There were rumors of mass graves at the site.\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P.

A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBlack Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}\n\nSuch news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>\n\nThe exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities;<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=265}}</ref> a military report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&GSvcid=117316 Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed]</ref> and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \"at least 105\";<ref name=\"Lane 256-66\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=265\u201366}}</ref> a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colfax Riot Historical Marker|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|year=1950 |url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/Grant/Colfax+Riot.html}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:\n\n{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority.

Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.
