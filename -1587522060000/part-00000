He was consistently rated by the ICC as being among the top international all-rounders in both ODI and Test cricket.\n\nFollowing his debut in 1998, he became an integral player for [[England cricket team|England]], and was \"Man of the Series\" in the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes]].

(Australian TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'', and being part of [[Sky One]]'s sports-based comedy panel show ''[[A League of Their Own (UK game show)|A League of Their Own]]''.

As a boy he played cricket for the Lancashire Schools under-11s and under-15s teams and he was also a keen [[chess]] player. He then played for 2\u00bd years in the England under-19 team.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years: criticism, injury and fitness troubles===\nFlintoff was captain of the England Under-19 team for their \"Test\" match tour to [[Pakistan]] in 1996/7 and at home against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/andrew-flintoff-a-career-in-pictures-2080999.html?action=gallery&ino=3 | title = Andrew Flintoff: A Career In Pictures | publisher = The Independent | accessdate = 25 March 2014 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 September 2010}}</ref> He made his [[Test cricket|Test match]] debut for England in 1998 against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Trent Bridge]], in a match remembered for its second-innings duel between [[Mike Atherton]] and [[Allan Donald]]; in a precursor to their subsequent rivalry, Flintoff and [[Jacques Kallis]] exchanged wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63807.html |title=England v South Africa at Nottingham, 1998 |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref> Nonetheless, his struggle to make the grade at county level continued, he found form only intermittently, though often explosively when he did so.\n\nIn 2000, he hit 135 not out in the quarterfinals of the [[Natwest Trophy]] against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], which [[David Gower]] described as \"the most awesome innings we are ever going to see on a cricket field\". In the same year England's management made clear they were unhappy with his fitness and weight, Flintoff responded to his critics with 42 not out in a one-day game against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] on his home ground of [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]], forming an explosive second-wicket stand with [[Graeme Hick]]; as he collected the Man of the Match award he remarked his performance was \"not bad for a fat lad\".<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/88870.html \"England make light work in wintry weather\"] ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 27 August 2007</ref>\n\nAlthough he lost his England place during 2001, he remodelled his bowling action and gained a place on the 2001\u201302 tour to [[Indian cricket team|India]]. Though he hit possibly his worst international batting form during the Test series, frustrating him to the point that he broke down in tears in the dressing room at one stage, he later saw the tour as a turning point in his career, specifically the crucial final one-day match. Entrusted with bowling the final over with India needing 11 to win, he ran out [[Anil Kumble]] and bowled [[Javagal Srinath]] with successive balls to win the match, taking off his shirt in celebration, which was mimicked by [[Sourav Ganguly]] in a later match.\n\n===Improved consistency, step-up to key international player===\nIn 2002, he scored his maiden Test century. By 2003, a newer, fitter Flintoff started to justify the comparisons with [[Ian Botham|Botham]]. Up to the end of 2002, he had averaged just 19 with the bat and 47 with the ball; from 2003 to the end of the 2005 Ashes series, the corresponding figures were 43 and 28. In the summer of 2003 he scored a century and three fifties in the five Test series against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] at home, and continued to excel on the tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in March and April 2004, taking five wickets in the Test in Barbados, and scoring a century in Antigua. In early 2004 he was named as a ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]], having failed to make Wisden's top 40 list in 2002.\n\nAlthough injury prevented him from bowling, he was called into the England squad for the 2004 NatWest [[One Day International]] (ODI) Series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] as a specialist batsman, scoring two consecutive centuries in the series and hitting seven [[six (cricket)|sixes]] in one [[innings]].\n\nHe matched this haul in the Second Test against the West Indies at [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] in July, hitting a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] best figure of 167. During this innings, watched by a crowd of 20,000, Flintoff hit a [[six (cricket)|six]] into the top tier of the Ryder Stand. A man stood to claim the catch and dropped it \u2013 it was Flintoff's father.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynch, Steven |date= 4 February 2013|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/603071.html |title=ESPNcricinfo XI: Coincidences in cricket &#124; Cricket |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> Over the course of England's record-breaking summer, he hit a half-century in all seven victorious Tests against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]. On returning to the [[One Day International|one-day]] game as an [[all-rounder]] in September he fell agonisingly short of a third [[One Day International|one-day]] century, caught on 99 against [[Indian cricket team|India]], though he went on to hit a further century in the [[ICC Champions Trophy 2004]] pool match against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] two weeks later.\n\nAt the end of the season he was named as the inaugural winner of the [[ICC Awards|ICC Award]] for [[One Day International|one-day]] player of the year, and the [[Professional Cricketers' Association]] player of the year. He also became a father when his fianc\u00e9e Rachael Wools gave birth on 6 September. They now have a second child who was born during the series in India in 2006. Flintoff briefly returned home from the tour to see his son for the first time.\n\n===2005: Ashes winner===\n[[Image:Flintoff in jest.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Flintoff during practice session]]\nFollowing the Test series in [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in December 2004 and January 2005, Flintoff flew home for surgery on his left ankle, leading to worries he might not regain fitness in time for [[The 2005 Ashes|The Ashes]]. In fact, following a rehabilitation programme of swimming and hill-walking, he recovered ahead of schedule and was able to return to action for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in April.\n\nIn the Second Test against Australia at [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] in August 2005, he broke Ian Botham's 1981 record of six sixes in an Ashes Test Match with five in the first innings, and a further four in the second innings: he scored 141 runs in total. In the same game he took a total of seven wickets (across both innings), including the wickets of [[Justin Langer|Langer]] and [[Ricky Ponting|Ponting]] in his first over in Australia's run-chase. He managed all this despite a shoulder injury early in the second innings. England won the game by just two runs, and saved their hopes of regaining the Ashes. Flintoff was named 'Man of the Match' and captain [[Michael Vaughan]] subsequently dubbed the match \"Fred's Test\" in honour of his achievement.\n\nFlintoff scored a century during England's crucial win at Trent Bridge. He took five wickets on the fourth day of the final Test match, enabling England to go off for bad light and helping them eventually to secure a draw and regain the Ashes.\n\nFor his achievements throughout the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes]] series, he was named as \"Man of the Series\" by Australian coach, [[John Buchanan (cricketer, born 1953)|John Buchanan]]. His achievement also won him the inaugural [[Compton-Miller Award|Compton-Miller Medal]]. He was also awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Preston.\n\nIn October 2005, Flintoff shared the [[Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy]] for the ICC player of the year award with [[Jacques Kallis]] of South Africa. In December 2005, Flintoff was crowned [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] for 2005, the first cricketer since Botham in 1981. In the New Year's Honours List for 2006, Flintoff was appointed an MBE for his role in the successful Ashes side. In January 2006, Flintoff was presented with the [[Freedom of the City]] award for [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], Lancashire. The award was presented to Flintoff by the mayor of Preston. Other recipients of the award include Sir [[Tom Finney]] and [[Nick Park]].\n\n===England captaincy===\n[[Image:Andrew Flintoff bowl.jpg|thumb|80px|Flintoff bowls in the nets at [[Adelaide Oval]]]]\nIn February 2006 following England captain [[Michael Vaughan]] and vice-captain [[Marcus Trescothick]] becoming unavailable for the first Test match against India, Flintoff was named captain of the England team and subsequently announced that he would be staying in India for the entire Test series, although he and his wife were expecting their second child. His wife gave birth to a son, Corey, shortly before the second Test on 9 March.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4788320.stm Baby delight for captain Flintoff].\" BBC Sport. 9 March 2006. Retrieved 15 March 2006.</ref>\n\nOn the field, Flintoff was seen as a great success during the drawn series with India, with a 212-run victory in [[Mumbai]]. His contributions with both bat and ball ensured that he was named as the player of the series, with many commentators seeing Flintoff as someone who not only worked better under the responsibility but was also viewed as a great influence of an inexperienced side, which included many debutants, such as [[Alastair Cook]], [[Owais Shah]] and [[Monty Panesar]]. Flintoff amassed four fifties in the series, and took 11 wickets, on unfriendly surfaces for seamers. Flintoff continued to captain England during the seven ODIs in India, although he was rested for two matches. Sri Lanka toured in May and England drew the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|three-Test series]] 1\u20131. The series took a heavy toll on Flintoff physically, and journalist David Hopps remarked\n\n{{quote|By the end of the series, Flintoff was also a crock, succumbing to a further ankle injury that put his role in the winter's Ashes in doubt. Could this be traced back to the opening Test at Lord's when, in his first serious bowl of the season, and somewhat above his fighting weight, he bowled an excessive 68.3 overs and nothing above 85mph? He had gone from shock bowler to stock bowler&nbsp;\u2013 under his own captaincy, too.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/291999.html |title=England v Sri Lanka, 2006 |first=David |last=Hopps |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 April 2012|date=23 April 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nA recurrence of his long-term ankle problem in the Test series meant Flintoff missed both the ODI series against Sri Lanka, and the first Test against Pakistan. It was later announced in July that Flintoff's rehabilitation had not been sufficient to quell the injury, and that further surgery would be required. He was thus ruled out for the entire series against Pakistan. Despite injury concerns, Flintoff was later named for the [[ICC Champions Trophy]], where he played as a specialist batsman, not as an all-rounder.\n\n===2006\u201307 Ashes series===\nAfter his previous stint as captain in the Test series against India, Flintoff returned as captain of the England team for the eagerly anticipated [[2006-07 Ashes series]] in Australia. The series turned out to be a humiliating one for Flintoff, leading his side to five straight losses and thus losing the Ashes after having held them for the shortest time in history. In addition, he presided over England's worst ever defeat in an Ashes series, equalling the 1921 whitewash at the hands of the [[Warwick Armstrong]]-led Australian team in the wake of World War I.\n[[Image:Andrew Flintoff bowling.jpg|thumb|left|Flintoff bowling against Australia in [[2006\u201307 Ashes series|The Ashes]] series]]\n\nFlintoff's own play in the 2006\u201307 series, both bowling and at the crease, was generally deemed disappointing. He made only two scores over 50 in the series, his best bowling figures were 4\u201399 in the first innings of the First Test in Brisbane, and he failed to take five wickets in a match. Flintoff played in only one first-class game in the lead up to the series. He was initially undone by Australia's excellent seam bowling but his batting improved throughout the series as he got more match practice. A persistent ankle injury prevented Flintoff from bowling long spells at full pace and Australia's batsmen took advantage of this. According to Nasser Hussain during the tour he also had three or four warnings for inappropriate behaviour and binge drinking,<ref>[http://worldcup.cricket365.com/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=cricket/07/03/18/manual_155822.html \"Flintoff \u2013 I have no excuses\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181225/http://worldcup.cricket365.com/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=cricket%2F07%2F03%2F18%2Fmanual_155822.html |date=28 September 2007 }} World Cup Cricket 365.

Michael Vaughan's return from knee surgery was cut short by a hamstring injury and he was only able to play two matches, leaving Flintoff in charge for the remaining games. England qualified in the last game of eight group matches for the best-of-three finals against Australia, but reversed their poor form on tour with a 2\u20130 series win in the finals.\n\nFlintoff contributed significantly with the ball in both matches, taking three wickets in the first match and allowing only 10 runs off five overs in the second as Australia chased a reduced total in a rain-hit match.\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup===\nWith [[Michael Vaughan]] returning from injury for the [[Cricket World Cup]] in the [[West Indies]], Flintoff was replaced as captain but appointed [[English cricket team|England]]'s vice-captain.\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], Flintoff was out first ball in England's innings and, although conceding only 17 runs in eight overs, he failed to take a wicket. He did, however, take a stunning one-handed catch at slip to dismiss [[Ross Taylor]] for a duck. On the evening of England's defeat Flintoff, along with some other players and coaches from the England squad, indulged in some late night drinking in a night club, only two days before their vital match against [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]]. In the early hours of the morning, he reportedly had to be rescued after falling off a [[pedalo]] \u2013 this quickly became known in the media as the \"Fredalo\" incident.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/12/andrew-flintoff-pedalo-escapade-piers-morgan|title=Andrew Flintoff: the truth about that pedalo escapade with England|date=2014-09-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-17|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Flintoff and the others involved were reprimanded and fined, with Flintoff being stripped of the vice-captaincy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/6464251.stm |title=England v Canada report |publisher=BBC News |date=18 March 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref> In addition, he was suspended for the match against Canada.

In the Super 8 matches, Flintoff often excelled with the ball but failed to recover his batting form. Against Ireland he took 4\u201343 and scored 43 runs; against Sri Lanka he took 3\u201335 but was out for 2 and against Australia he took 1\u201335 but was out for 4. In the next match against Bangladesh Flintoff took 1\u201338 in eight overs and scored 23 runs off 21 balls. Ultimately, he failed to influence an ailing English side and had a poor tournament. [[Michael Vaughan]] later commented that Flintoff's pedalo antics had adversely affected team morale.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6721459.stm \"Flintoff antics \"dented Cup bid\"\"] BBC News.

After again returning to action in county cricket he was recalled to the England squad for the second Test against South Africa, where he missed the last 17 Tests prior. He took his 200th Test wicket in the Third Test, trapping [[Neil McKenzie]] [[Leg before wicket|lbw]] for 72. Flintoff bowled consistently against the South Africans, but South African coach [[Mickey Arthur]] felt that he was too defensive.<ref name=booth>[[Lawrence Booth|Booth, Lawrence]] (30 June 2009). \"Myths; And stereotypes.\" ''The Spin''.</ref>  His batting also began to show promise as he consistently made starts, before being moved back up to bat at six when [[Kevin Pietersen]] took over as captain. In the following one day series, Flintoff was an important player for England, leading Pietersen to describe him as \"a superstar\". Flintoff scored 78 in both the first and the third matches \u2013 he was not required to bat in the second \u2013 as well as 31 not out off 12 balls in the fourth, whilst taking three wickets in the same match. This led many pundits to speculate that Flintoff might just be back to his best. He won Man of the Series in the ODI home series against South Africa, where England won four-nil: the last match was washed out. He was both the top run-scorer and the top wicket-taker of that series. Still, though, his want of consistency frustrated the pundits. \"Flintoff,\" wrote [[Peter Roebuck]] some time later, \"is a fine cricketer who has never quite worked out how he takes wickets or scores runs.

He was consistently rated by the ICC as being among the top international all-rounders in both ODI and Test cricket.\n\nFollowing his debut in 1998, he became an integral player for [[England cricket team|England]], and was \"Man of the Series\" in the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes]]. He later served as both captain and vice-captain of the team.\n\nHe retired from Test cricket at the end of the [[2009 Ashes series]], and from other forms of the game in 2010.<ref name=\"full retirement\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9005165.stm|title=Andrew Flintoff calls time on cricket career|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513192659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9005165.stm|archivedate=13 May 2014|url-status=live|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> He then had one [[professional boxing]] fight on 30 November 2012 in Manchester, beating American Richard Dawson on a points decision.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/9714885/Andrew-Freddie-Flintoff-v-Richard-Dawson-live.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rod | last=Gilmour | title=Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff v Richard Dawson: live | date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Flintoff came out of retirement to play [[Twenty20]] cricket for Lancashire, before being signed by [[Brisbane Heat]] to play in the Australian [[Big Bash League]] for the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nSince his retirement, Flintoff has been involved with numerous projects, including designing his own fashion range and becoming the face of the brand Jacamo, winning the first series of the Australian version of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (Australian TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'', and being part of [[Sky One]]'s sports-based comedy panel show ''[[A League of Their Own (UK game show)|A League of Their Own]]''. Flintoff became a presenter of the [[BBC Two]] show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nFlintoff's father Colin was a plumber and factory maintenance worker and the captain of Dutton Forshaw second XI cricket team. Andrew attended Greenlands Community Primary School and Ribbleton Hall High School (subsequently renamed City of Preston High School).<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|last=Davies |first=Gareth A |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/2364865/Flintoff-the-early-years....html |title=Flintoff: the early years... |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> His first trip abroad at age 14 was to Argentina.<ref name=\"Telegraph: 2019 by Paper\">{{Citation \n| date       =June 24, 2019\n| title      ='Holiday friends?

As a boy he played cricket for the Lancashire Schools under-11s and under-15s teams and he was also a keen [[chess]] player. He then played for 2\u00bd years in the England under-19 team.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years: criticism, injury and fitness troubles===\nFlintoff was captain of the England Under-19 team for their \"Test\" match tour to [[Pakistan]] in 1996/7 and at home against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/andrew-flintoff-a-career-in-pictures-2080999.html?action=gallery&ino=3 | title = Andrew Flintoff: A Career In Pictures | publisher = The Independent | accessdate = 25 March 2014 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 September 2010}}</ref> He made his [[Test cricket|Test match]] debut for England in 1998 against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Trent Bridge]], in a match remembered for its second-innings duel between [[Mike Atherton]] and [[Allan Donald]]; in a precursor to their subsequent rivalry, Flintoff and [[Jacques Kallis]] exchanged wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63807.html |title=England v South Africa at Nottingham, 1998 |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref> Nonetheless, his struggle to make the grade at county level continued, he found form only intermittently, though often explosively when he did so.\n\nIn 2000, he hit 135 not out in the quarterfinals of the [[Natwest Trophy]] against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], which [[David Gower]] described as \"the most awesome innings we are ever going to see on a cricket field\". In the same year England's management made clear they were unhappy with his fitness and weight, Flintoff responded to his critics with 42 not out in a one-day game against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] on his home ground of [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]], forming an explosive second-wicket stand with [[Graeme Hick]]; as he collected the Man of the Match award he remarked his performance was \"not bad for a fat lad\".<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/88870.html \"England make light work in wintry weather\"] ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 27 August 2007</ref>\n\nAlthough he lost his England place during 2001, he remodelled his bowling action and gained a place on the 2001\u201302 tour to [[Indian cricket team|India]]. Though he hit possibly his worst international batting form during the Test series, frustrating him to the point that he broke down in tears in the dressing room at one stage, he later saw the tour as a turning point in his career, specifically the crucial final one-day match. Entrusted with bowling the final over with India needing 11 to win, he ran out [[Anil Kumble]] and bowled [[Javagal Srinath]] with successive balls to win the match, taking off his shirt in celebration, which was mimicked by [[Sourav Ganguly]] in a later match.\n\n===Improved consistency, step-up to key international player===\nIn 2002, he scored his maiden Test century. By 2003, a newer, fitter Flintoff started to justify the comparisons with [[Ian Botham|Botham]]. Up to the end of 2002, he had averaged just 19 with the bat and 47 with the ball; from 2003 to the end of the 2005 Ashes series, the corresponding figures were 43 and 28. In the summer of 2003 he scored a century and three fifties in the five Test series against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] at home, and continued to excel on the tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in March and April 2004, taking five wickets in the Test in Barbados, and scoring a century in Antigua. In early 2004 he was named as a ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]], having failed to make Wisden's top 40 list in 2002.\n\nAlthough injury prevented him from bowling, he was called into the England squad for the 2004 NatWest [[One Day International]] (ODI) Series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] as a specialist batsman, scoring two consecutive centuries in the series and hitting seven [[six (cricket)|sixes]] in one [[innings]].\n\nHe matched this haul in the Second Test against the West Indies at [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] in July, hitting a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] best figure of 167. During this innings, watched by a crowd of 20,000, Flintoff hit a [[six (cricket)|six]] into the top tier of the Ryder Stand. A man stood to claim the catch and dropped it \u2013 it was Flintoff's father.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynch, Steven |date= 4 February 2013|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/603071.html |title=ESPNcricinfo XI: Coincidences in cricket &#124; Cricket |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> Over the course of England's record-breaking summer, he hit a half-century in all seven victorious Tests against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]. On returning to the [[One Day International|one-day]] game as an [[all-rounder]] in September he fell agonisingly short of a third [[One Day International|one-day]] century, caught on 99 against [[Indian cricket team|India]], though he went on to hit a further century in the [[ICC Champions Trophy 2004]] pool match against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] two weeks later.\n\nAt the end of the season he was named as the inaugural winner of the [[ICC Awards|ICC Award]] for [[One Day International|one-day]] player of the year, and the [[Professional Cricketers' Association]] player of the year. He also became a father when his fianc\u00e9e Rachael Wools gave birth on 6 September. They now have a second child who was born during the series in India in 2006. Flintoff briefly returned home from the tour to see his son for the first time.\n\n===2005: Ashes winner===\n[[Image:Flintoff in jest.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Flintoff during practice session]]\nFollowing the Test series in [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in December 2004 and January 2005, Flintoff flew home for surgery on his left ankle, leading to worries he might not regain fitness in time for [[The 2005 Ashes|The Ashes]]. In fact, following a rehabilitation programme of swimming and hill-walking, he recovered ahead of schedule and was able to return to action for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in April.\n\nIn the Second Test against Australia at [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] in August 2005, he broke Ian Botham's 1981 record of six sixes in an Ashes Test Match with five in the first innings, and a further four in the second innings: he scored 141 runs in total. In the same game he took a total of seven wickets (across both innings), including the wickets of [[Justin Langer|Langer]] and [[Ricky Ponting|Ponting]] in his first over in Australia's run-chase. He managed all this despite a shoulder injury early in the second innings. England won the game by just two runs, and saved their hopes of regaining the Ashes. Flintoff was named 'Man of the Match' and captain [[Michael Vaughan]] subsequently dubbed the match \"Fred's Test\" in honour of his achievement.\n\nFlintoff scored a century during England's crucial win at Trent Bridge. He took five wickets on the fourth day of the final Test match, enabling England to go off for bad light and helping them eventually to secure a draw and regain the Ashes.\n\nFor his achievements throughout the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes]] series, he was named as \"Man of the Series\" by Australian coach, [[John Buchanan (cricketer, born 1953)|John Buchanan]]. His achievement also won him the inaugural [[Compton-Miller Award|Compton-Miller Medal]]. He was also awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Preston.\n\nIn October 2005, Flintoff shared the [[Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy]] for the ICC player of the year award with [[Jacques Kallis]] of South Africa. In December 2005, Flintoff was crowned [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] for 2005, the first cricketer since Botham in 1981. In the New Year's Honours List for 2006, Flintoff was appointed an MBE for his role in the successful Ashes side. In January 2006, Flintoff was presented with the [[Freedom of the City]] award for [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], Lancashire. The award was presented to Flintoff by the mayor of Preston. Other recipients of the award include Sir [[Tom Finney]] and [[Nick Park]].\n\n===England captaincy===\n[[Image:Andrew Flintoff bowl.jpg|thumb|80px|Flintoff bowls in the nets at [[Adelaide Oval]]]]\nIn February 2006 following England captain [[Michael Vaughan]] and vice-captain [[Marcus Trescothick]] becoming unavailable for the first Test match against India, Flintoff was named captain of the England team and subsequently announced that he would be staying in India for the entire Test series, although he and his wife were expecting their second child. His wife gave birth to a son, Corey, shortly before the second Test on 9 March.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4788320.stm Baby delight for captain Flintoff].\" BBC Sport. 9 March 2006. Retrieved 15 March 2006.</ref>\n\nOn the field, Flintoff was seen as a great success during the drawn series with India, with a 212-run victory in [[Mumbai]]. His contributions with both bat and ball ensured that he was named as the player of the series, with many commentators seeing Flintoff as someone who not only worked better under the responsibility but was also viewed as a great influence of an inexperienced side, which included many debutants, such as [[Alastair Cook]], [[Owais Shah]] and [[Monty Panesar]]. Flintoff amassed four fifties in the series, and took 11 wickets, on unfriendly surfaces for seamers. Flintoff continued to captain England during the seven ODIs in India, although he was rested for two matches. Sri Lanka toured in May and England drew the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|three-Test series]] 1\u20131. The series took a heavy toll on Flintoff physically, and journalist David Hopps remarked\n\n{{quote|By the end of the series, Flintoff was also a crock, succumbing to a further ankle injury that put his role in the winter's Ashes in doubt. Could this be traced back to the opening Test at Lord's when, in his first serious bowl of the season, and somewhat above his fighting weight, he bowled an excessive 68.3 overs and nothing above 85mph? He had gone from shock bowler to stock bowler&nbsp;\u2013 under his own captaincy, too.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/291999.html |title=England v Sri Lanka, 2006 |first=David |last=Hopps |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 April 2012|date=23 April 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nA recurrence of his long-term ankle problem in the Test series meant Flintoff missed both the ODI series against Sri Lanka, and the first Test against Pakistan. It was later announced in July that Flintoff's rehabilitation had not been sufficient to quell the injury, and that further surgery would be required. He was thus ruled out for the entire series against Pakistan. Despite injury concerns, Flintoff was later named for the [[ICC Champions Trophy]], where he played as a specialist batsman, not as an all-rounder.\n\n===2006\u201307 Ashes series===\nAfter his previous stint as captain in the Test series against India, Flintoff returned as captain of the England team for the eagerly anticipated [[2006-07 Ashes series]] in Australia. The series turned out to be a humiliating one for Flintoff, leading his side to five straight losses and thus losing the Ashes after having held them for the shortest time in history. In addition, he presided over England's worst ever defeat in an Ashes series, equalling the 1921 whitewash at the hands of the [[Warwick Armstrong]]-led Australian team in the wake of World War I.\n[[Image:Andrew Flintoff bowling.jpg|thumb|left|Flintoff bowling against Australia in [[2006\u201307 Ashes series|The Ashes]] series]]\n\nFlintoff's own play in the 2006\u201307 series, both bowling and at the crease, was generally deemed disappointing. He made only two scores over 50 in the series, his best bowling figures were 4\u201399 in the first innings of the First Test in Brisbane, and he failed to take five wickets in a match. Flintoff played in only one first-class game in the lead up to the series. He was initially undone by Australia's excellent seam bowling but his batting improved throughout the series as he got more match practice. A persistent ankle injury prevented Flintoff from bowling long spells at full pace and Australia's batsmen took advantage of this. According to Nasser Hussain during the tour he also had three or four warnings for inappropriate behaviour and binge drinking,<ref>[http://worldcup.cricket365.com/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=cricket/07/03/18/manual_155822.html \"Flintoff \u2013 I have no excuses\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181225/http://worldcup.cricket365.com/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=cricket%2F07%2F03%2F18%2Fmanual_155822.html |date=28 September 2007 }} World Cup Cricket 365.

Retrieved 27 August 2007</ref>\n\nFlintoff also captained England for several of the subsequent [[2006\u201307 Commonwealth Bank Series]] [[One Day International]] matches. Michael Vaughan's return from knee surgery was cut short by a hamstring injury and he was only able to play two matches, leaving Flintoff in charge for the remaining games. England qualified in the last game of eight group matches for the best-of-three finals against Australia, but reversed their poor form on tour with a 2\u20130 series win in the finals.\n\nFlintoff contributed significantly with the ball in both matches, taking three wickets in the first match and allowing only 10 runs off five overs in the second as Australia chased a reduced total in a rain-hit match.\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup===\nWith [[Michael Vaughan]] returning from injury for the [[Cricket World Cup]] in the [[West Indies]], Flintoff was replaced as captain but appointed [[English cricket team|England]]'s vice-captain.\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], Flintoff was out first ball in England's innings and, although conceding only 17 runs in eight overs, he failed to take a wicket.

After again returning to action in county cricket he was recalled to the England squad for the second Test against South Africa, where he missed the last 17 Tests prior. He took his 200th Test wicket in the Third Test, trapping [[Neil McKenzie]] [[Leg before wicket|lbw]] for 72. Flintoff bowled consistently against the South Africans, but South African coach [[Mickey Arthur]] felt that he was too defensive.<ref name=booth>[[Lawrence Booth|Booth, Lawrence]] (30 June 2009). \"Myths; And stereotypes.\" ''The Spin''.</ref>  His batting also began to show promise as he consistently made starts, before being moved back up to bat at six when [[Kevin Pietersen]] took over as captain. In the following one day series, Flintoff was an important player for England, leading Pietersen to describe him as \"a superstar\". Flintoff scored 78 in both the first and the third matches \u2013 he was not required to bat in the second \u2013 as well as 31 not out off 12 balls in the fourth, whilst taking three wickets in the same match. This led many pundits to speculate that Flintoff might just be back to his best. He won Man of the Series in the ODI home series against South Africa, where England won four-nil: the last match was washed out. He was both the top run-scorer and the top wicket-taker of that series. Still, though, his want of consistency frustrated the pundits. \"Flintoff,\" wrote [[Peter Roebuck]] some time later, \"is a fine cricketer who has never quite worked out how he takes wickets or scores runs.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.
