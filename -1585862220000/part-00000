During the [[World Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture]] (1935), Aragon opposed his former friend Andr\u00e9 Breton, who wanted to use the opportunity as a tribune to defend the writer [[Victor Serge]], associated with [[Leon Trotsky]]'s [[Left Opposition]].\n\nNevertheless, Aragon was also critical of the [[USSR]], particularly after the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1956) during which [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[personality cult]] was [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced]] by [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nThe French surrealists had long claimed [[Lewis Carroll]] as one of their own, and Aragon published his translation of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''<ref>''La Chasse au Snark'', Pierre Seghers, Paris 1949</ref> in 1929, \"shortly before he completed his transition from Snarxism to Marxism\", as [[Martin Gardner]] puts it.<ref>''The Annotated Snark'', edited by Martin Gardner, Penguin Books, 1974</ref> Witness the key stanza of the poem in Aragon's translation:\n\n{{cquote|''Ils le traqu\u00e8rent avec des gobelets ils le traqu\u00e8rent avec soin''<br />\n''Ils le poursuivirent avec des fourches et de l'espoir''<br />\n''Ils menac\u00e8rent sa vie avec une action de chemin de fer''<br />\n''Ils le charm\u00e8rent avec des sourires et du savon''}}\n\nGardner, who calls the translation \"pedestrian\" and deems the rest of Aragon's writings on Carroll's nonsense poetry full of factual errors, says that there is no evidence that Aragon intended any of it as a joke.\n\n=== The ''Commune'' (1933\u20131939) ===\n\nApart from working as a [[journalist]] for ''L'Humanit\u00e9'', Louis Aragon also became, along with [[Paul Nizan]], editor secretary of the journal ''[[Commune (journal)|Commune]]'', published by the ''[[Association des \u00c9crivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires]]'' (Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), which aimed at gathering [[intellectual]]s and artists in a common front [[anti-fascism|against fascism]]. Aragon became a member of the directing committee of the ''Commune'' journal in January 1937, along with [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Romain Rolland]] and [[Paul Vaillant-Couturier]]. The journal then took the name of \"French literary review for the defence of culture\" (''\u00ab revue litt\u00e9raire fran\u00e7aise pour la d\u00e9fense de la culture \u00bb''). With Gide's withdrawal in August 1937, Vaillant-Couturier's death in autumn 1937 and Romain Rolland's old age, Aragon became its effective director. In December 1938, he called as [[chief editor]] the young writer [[Jacques Decour]]. The ''Commune'' journal was strongly involved in the mobilization of French intellectuals in favor of the [[Spanish Second Republic|Spanish Republic]].\n\n=== Director of ''Ce soir'' (1937\u20131953) ===\n\nIn March 1937, Aragon was called on by the PCF to head the new evening daily, ''[[Ce soir]]'', which he was charged with launching, along with the writer [[Jean-Richard Bloch]]. ''Ce soir'' attempted to compete with ''[[Paris-Soir]]''. Outlawed in August 1939, ''Ce soir'' was re-opened after the Liberation, and Aragon again became its lead, first with Bloch then alone after Bloch's death in 1947. The newspaper, which counted [[Emile Dano\u00ebn]] among its collaborators, closed in March 1953.\n\n== World War II (1939\u20131945) ==\n\nIn 1939 he married Russian-born author [[Elsa Triolet]], the sister of [[Lilya Brik]], a mistress and then partner of Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Elsa Triolet and Aragon|url=https://www.maison-triolet-aragon.com/elsa-triolet-and-louis-aragon|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> He had met her in 1928, and she became his [[muse]] starting in the 1940s. Aragon and Triolet collaborated in the [[French Left|left-wing French]] media before and during World War II, going underground for most of the [[Vichy France|German occupation]].\n\nAragon was mobilized in 1939, and awarded the ''[[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945|Croix de guerre]]'' (War Cross) and the military medal for acts of bravery. After the [[Battle of France|May 1940 defeat]], he took refuge in the [[Vichy France|Southern Zone]]. He was one of several poets, along with [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Jean Pr\u00e9vost]], [[Jean-Pierre Rosnay]], etc., to join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts.\n\n[[Otto Abetz]] was the German governor, and produced a series of \"black lists\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] were both on these \"Otto Lists\" of forbidden authors.<ref>Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press ''[[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit]]'' and was a member of the [[National Front (Resistance)|National Front]] Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors ([[Jean Bruller]]), [[Pierre Seghers]] or [[Paul \u00c9luard|Paul Eluard]] in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher [[Fran\u00e7ois Lachenal]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ONJXAAAAYAAJ&q=fran%C3%A7ois+lachenal+luis+aragon&dq=fran%C3%A7ois+lachenal+luis+aragon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS5PWP2LvWAhXFfFAKHc2MCgMQ6AEIXDAI|title=Livres hebdo|date=1995|publisher=\u00c9ditions professionelles du livre.|isbn=9782877302500|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nHe participated with his wife in the setting-up of the National Front of Writers in the Southern Zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]], who had chosen [[Collaborationism]].\n\nAlong with Paul \u00c9luard, [[Pierre Seghers]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, ''[[L'affiche rouge (Poem)|Strophes pour se souvenir]]'' in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e]]'' (FTP-MOI).\n\nThe theme of the poem was the [[Affiche Rouge|Red Poster]] affair, mainly the last letter that [[Missak Manouchian]], an Armenian-French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife [[M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Manouchian|M\u00e9lin\u00e9e]] before his execution on 21 February 1944.<ref>M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Manouchian: ''Manouchian'', EFR, Paris 1954</ref> This poem was then set to music by [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]].\n\n== After the war ==\n\nAt the Liberation, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the ''[[Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains]]'' (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, [[Maurice Thorez]], and defended the [[Kominform]]'s condemnation of the [[Titoist]] regime in [[Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal, ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'', published a drawing by [[Pablo Picasso]] on the occasion of Stalin's death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of [[Stalinist]] repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'' (1953\u20131972) ===\n\nIn the days following the disappearance of ''Ce soir'', in March 1953, Aragon became the director of ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' 's literary supplement, ''[[French Letters|Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises]]''. Assisted by its chief editor, [[Pierre Daix]], Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against [[Stalinism]] and its consequences in [[Eastern Europe]]. He published the writings of dissidents such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] or [[Milan Kundera]]. The monetary loss caused by ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'' led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded.\n\nIn 1956, Aragon supported the [[Budapest insurrection]], provoking the dissolution of the ''Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains'', which [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]] quit. The same year, he was nevertheless granted the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. He now harshly condemned Soviet totalitarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned [[show trial]]s against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 [[Sinyavsky-Daniel trial]]). He strongly supported the student movement of [[May '68]], although the PCF was skeptical about it. The crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of [[Milan Kundera]]'s books (''La Plaisanterie'').<ref>French: ''\u00ab Et voil\u00e0 qu'une fin de nuit, au transistor, nous avons entendu la condamnation de nos illusions perp\u00e9tuelles... \u00bb''</ref> Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF's central committee until his death.\n\n=== The publisher ===\n\nBeside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also [[CEO]] of the ''[[Editeurs fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9unis]]'' (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, ''La Biblioth\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Hier et Aujourd'hui''. He directed the EFR along with [[Madeleine Braun]], and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the \"[[Socialist Realism]]\" current. Among other works, the EFR published [[Andr\u00e9 Stil]]'s ''Premier choc'', which owed to the future [[Goncourt Academy|Goncourt Academician]] the [[Stalin Peace Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1953. But they also published other writers, such as [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Y\u00e1nnis R\u00edtsos]] or [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. In the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Sovietic writers, such as [[Tchinguiz A\u00eftmatov]], or Russian writers belong to the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], such as [[Galina Nicola\u00ebva]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]'s ''Babi Iar'' in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of [[Christa Wolf]] in 1964, and launched the poetic collection ''Petite sir\u00e8ne'', which collected works by [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic]], [[Nicolas Guillen]], but also less known poets such as [[Dominique Grandmont]], [[Alain Lance]] or [[Jean Ristat]].\n\n=== Back to surrealism ===\n\nFree from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of ''[[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]'' \u2014 ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'''s literary supplement \u2014 in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots.  During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: ''[[Henri Matisse Roman]]'' and ''[[Les Adieux]]''.\n\nLouis Aragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend [[Jean Ristat]] sitting up with him. He was buried in the parc of [[Moulin de Villeneuve]], in his property of [[Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines]], alongside his wife Elsa Triolet.\n\nHe was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various singers : [[Lino L\u00e9onardi]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Martin]], [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]] (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough ''[[Les Chansons d'Aragon]]'' album), [[Jean Ferrat]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Alain Barri\u00e8re]], [[Isabelle Aubret]], [[Nicole Rieu]], [[Monique Morelli]], [[Marc Ogeret]], et al.

Aragon's mother passed Andrieux off to her son as his [[godparent|godfather]]. Aragon was only told the truth at the age of 19, as he was leaving to serve in the [[First World War]], from which neither he nor his parents believed he would return. Andrieux's refusal or inability to recognize his son would influence Aragon's poetry later on.\n\nHaving been involved in [[Dada]]ism from 1919 to 1924, he became a founding member of [[Surrealism]] in 1924,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lblcBR7uDoYC&lpg=PA71&dq=louis%20aragon%20dadaism%201919%201924&hl=en&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Facts on File Companion to World Poetry: 1900 to the Present|last=Arana|first=R.

He was one of several poets, along with [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Jean Pr\u00e9vost]], [[Jean-Pierre Rosnay]], etc., to join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts.\n\n[[Otto Abetz]] was the German governor, and produced a series of \"black lists\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] were both on these \"Otto Lists\" of forbidden authors.<ref>Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press ''[[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit]]'' and was a member of the [[National Front (Resistance)|National Front]] Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors ([[Jean Bruller]]), [[Pierre Seghers]] or [[Paul \u00c9luard|Paul Eluard]] in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher [[Fran\u00e7ois Lachenal]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ONJXAAAAYAAJ&q=fran%C3%A7ois+lachenal+luis+aragon&dq=fran%C3%A7ois+lachenal+luis+aragon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS5PWP2LvWAhXFfFAKHc2MCgMQ6AEIXDAI|title=Livres hebdo|date=1995|publisher=\u00c9ditions professionelles du livre.|isbn=9782877302500|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nHe participated with his wife in the setting-up of the National Front of Writers in the Southern Zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]], who had chosen [[Collaborationism]].\n\nAlong with Paul \u00c9luard, [[Pierre Seghers]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, ''[[L'affiche rouge (Poem)|Strophes pour se souvenir]]'' in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e]]'' (FTP-MOI).\n\nThe theme of the poem was the [[Affiche Rouge|Red Poster]] affair, mainly the last letter that [[Missak Manouchian]], an Armenian-French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife [[M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Manouchian|M\u00e9lin\u00e9e]] before his execution on 21 February 1944.<ref>M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Manouchian: ''Manouchian'', EFR, Paris 1954</ref> This poem was then set to music by [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]].\n\n== After the war ==\n\nAt the Liberation, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the ''[[Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains]]'' (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, [[Maurice Thorez]], and defended the [[Kominform]]'s condemnation of the [[Titoist]] regime in [[Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal, ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'', published a drawing by [[Pablo Picasso]] on the occasion of Stalin's death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of [[Stalinist]] repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'' (1953\u20131972) ===\n\nIn the days following the disappearance of ''Ce soir'', in March 1953, Aragon became the director of ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' 's literary supplement, ''[[French Letters|Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises]]''. Assisted by its chief editor, [[Pierre Daix]], Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against [[Stalinism]] and its consequences in [[Eastern Europe]]. He published the writings of dissidents such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] or [[Milan Kundera]]. The monetary loss caused by ''Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises'' led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded.\n\nIn 1956, Aragon supported the [[Budapest insurrection]], provoking the dissolution of the ''Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains'', which [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]] quit. The same year, he was nevertheless granted the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. He now harshly condemned Soviet totalitarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned [[show trial]]s against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 [[Sinyavsky-Daniel trial]]). He strongly supported the student movement of [[May '68]], although the PCF was skeptical about it. The crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of [[Milan Kundera]]'s books (''La Plaisanterie'').<ref>French: ''\u00ab Et voil\u00e0 qu'une fin de nuit, au transistor, nous avons entendu la condamnation de nos illusions perp\u00e9tuelles... \u00bb''</ref> Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF's central committee until his death.\n\n=== The publisher ===\n\nBeside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also [[CEO]] of the ''[[Editeurs fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9unis]]'' (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, ''La Biblioth\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Hier et Aujourd'hui''. He directed the EFR along with [[Madeleine Braun]], and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the \"[[Socialist Realism]]\" current. Among other works, the EFR published [[Andr\u00e9 Stil]]'s ''Premier choc'', which owed to the future [[Goncourt Academy|Goncourt Academician]] the [[Stalin Peace Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1953. But they also published other writers, such as [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Y\u00e1nnis R\u00edtsos]] or [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. In the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Sovietic writers, such as [[Tchinguiz A\u00eftmatov]], or Russian writers belong to the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], such as [[Galina Nicola\u00ebva]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]'s ''Babi Iar'' in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of [[Christa Wolf]] in 1964, and launched the poetic collection ''Petite sir\u00e8ne'', which collected works by [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic]], [[Nicolas Guillen]], but also less known poets such as [[Dominique Grandmont]], [[Alain Lance]] or [[Jean Ristat]].\n\n=== Back to surrealism ===\n\nFree from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of ''[[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]'' \u2014 ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'''s literary supplement \u2014 in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots.  During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: ''[[Henri Matisse Roman]]'' and ''[[Les Adieux]]''.\n\nLouis Aragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend [[Jean Ristat]] sitting up with him. He was buried in the parc of [[Moulin de Villeneuve]], in his property of [[Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines]], alongside his wife Elsa Triolet.\n\nHe was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various singers : [[Lino L\u00e9onardi]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Martin]], [[L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9]] (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough ''[[Les Chansons d'Aragon]]'' album), [[Jean Ferrat]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Alain Barri\u00e8re]], [[Isabelle Aubret]], [[Nicole Rieu]], [[Monique Morelli]], [[Marc Ogeret]], et al. Many of his poems put into music by Jean Ferrat have been translated into German by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser) and are sung by his Duo.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Novels and short stories ===\n* ''Anicet ou le Panorama, roman'' ([[1921 in literature|1921]])\n* ''[[Les Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque (Louis Aragon)|Les Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque]]'' ([[1922 in literature|1922]])\n* ''Le Libertinage'' ([[1924 in literature|1924]])\n* ''[[Le Paysan de Paris]]'' ([[1926 in literature|1926]])\n* ''[[Irene's Cunt (Le Con d'Ir\u00e8ne)|Le Con d'Ir\u00e8ne]]'' ([[1927 in literature|1927]], published under the pseudonym Albert de Routisie)\n* ''Les Cloches de B\u00e2le'' (\"Le Monde r\u00e9el\", [[1934 in literature|1934]])\n* ''Les Beaux Quartiers'' (\"Le Monde r\u00e9el\", [[1936 in literature|1936]], Renaudot Prize winner)\n* ''Les Voyageurs de l'Imp\u00e9riale'' (\"Le Monde r\u00e9el\", [[1942 in literature|1942]])\n* ''Aur\u00e9lien (roman)|Aur\u00e9lien'' (\"Le Monde r\u00e9el\", [[1944 in literature|1944]])\n* ''Servitude et Grandeur des Fran\u00e7ais.
