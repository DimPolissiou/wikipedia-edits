The game is a sequel to the 1981 board game [[Dark Tower (game)|''Dark Tower'']], by [[Milton Bradley Company]]. ''Return to Dark Tower'' has players cooperate or compete as they rule over kingdoms surrounding the titular Tower, with their chosen \"heroes\" gathering resources, defeating monsters and enhancing their strength. As the game progresses, the Tower dispenses corruption across the land, which players must cleanse, while also looking to identify the foe inhabiting the Tower, so that they may defeat it, to win the game. ''Return to Dark Tower'' features a circular mat that is sectioned into quarters, to represent the kingdoms, with a [[Bluetooth]]-powered Tower at the center, which is connected to an app that runs the game.\n\n''Return to Dark Tower'' was designed by a team of board game industry veterans - most notably the creator of ''[[Gloomhaven]]'', Isaac Childres and the creator of ''[[Pandemic (board game)#Pandemic Legacy: Season 1|Pandemic: Legacy]]'', Rob Daviau. The game was in development for three years prior to the launch of a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Kickstarter]] in January 2020. The Kickstarter campaign proved to be successful, with over $4 million raised, against a goal of $850,000. ''Return to Dark Tower'' is tentatively set to be released in February 2021.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe premise of ''Return to Dark Tower'' is that the Tower, which was once destroyed, has been rebuilt over many years by an unknown evil and now threatens to corrupt all the land. The central objective of the game is for the players to repel the attacks from the Tower, to identify the foe inside and to break in and kill it. One to four players take up position around a circular game mat representative of the realm, with a plastic electronic obelisk, representative of the Tower, situated at the center. The Tower is connected via [[Bluetooth]] to an app that prompts it to move with certain in-game events, as well as virtually organize and run the whole game.<ref>{{cite web | last = Romain | first = Lindsey | url = https://nerdist.com/article/return-to-dark-tower-kickstarter/ | title = RETURN TO DARK TOWER Updates an Iconic Role-Playing Game | date = January 14, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist.com]]}}</ref> Players are given command over their kingdom that includes their quarter of the game mat, complete with fortresses, communities and locations, which may produce economic resources or be the sites for quests and battles. Each player controls a character called a \"hero\", who may traverse between locations with every turn and retains special starting items and scale-able abilities dictated by a special card.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/an-80s-electronic-game-classic-gets-an-app-driven-reboot-in-return-to-dark-tower/ | title = A cult '80s electronic game gets an app-driven reboot in Return to Dark Tower | date = March 11, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[CNET]]}}</ref> At the end of their turn, the player is to insert a plastic skull - representative of corruption - into an opening at the top of the Tower. When the skulls are released into a kingdom by the Tower, the kingdom's player must allocate them onto their structures and look to use their turns to battle the corruption. The skulls may be released either immediately or when a player is tasked with opening a compartment in the side of the Tower, causing the corruption to be released ''en masse''. Players are allotted with an amount of turns representative of six months - the game becomes increasingly challenging, with more quests to complete, while also contending with the flow of corruption out of the Tower. If the Tower becomes too powerful and overwhelms the kingdoms, the game is lost.<ref name=\"IGNImpressions\">{{cite web | last = Marks | first = Tom | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-dark-tower-first-impressions-and-unboxing-its-massive-mechanical-tower | title = Return to Dark Tower: First Impressions and Unboxing Its Massive Mechanical Tower | date = January 30, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[IGN]]}}</ref> ''Return to Dark Tower'' features two cooperative and game modes, with mindfulness pertaining to the others' kingdoms being crucial.

A strictly competitive game, ''Dark Tower'' pits up to four players against one another, with each player controlling a kingdom identical to the others, encompassing a quarter of the circular map board. At the center of the board is the battery-powered Tower, which contains a small [[membrane keyboard]] beneath a carousel that features a backlit display, depicting any number of pictures.

The game is a sequel to the 1981 board game [[Dark Tower (game)|''Dark Tower'']], by [[Milton Bradley Company]]. ''Return to Dark Tower'' has players cooperate or compete as they rule over kingdoms surrounding the titular Tower, with their chosen \"heroes\" gathering resources, defeating monsters and enhancing their strength. As the game progresses, the Tower dispenses corruption across the land, which players must cleanse, while also looking to identify the foe inhabiting the Tower, so that they may defeat it, to win the game. ''Return to Dark Tower'' features a circular mat that is sectioned into quarters, to represent the kingdoms, with a [[Bluetooth]]-powered Tower at the center, which is connected to an app that runs the game.\n\n''Return to Dark Tower'' was designed by a team of board game industry veterans - most notably the creator of ''[[Gloomhaven]]'', Isaac Childres and the creator of ''[[Pandemic (board game)#Pandemic Legacy: Season 1|Pandemic: Legacy]]'', Rob Daviau. The game was in development for three years prior to the launch of a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Kickstarter]] in January 2020. The Kickstarter campaign proved to be successful, with over $4 million raised, against a goal of $850,000. ''Return to Dark Tower'' is tentatively set to be released in February 2021.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe premise of ''Return to Dark Tower'' is that the Tower, which was once destroyed, has been rebuilt over many years by an unknown evil and now threatens to corrupt all the land. The central objective of the game is for the players to repel the attacks from the Tower, to identify the foe inside and to break in and kill it. One to four players take up position around a circular game mat representative of the realm, with a plastic electronic obelisk, representative of the Tower, situated at the center. The Tower is connected via [[Bluetooth]] to an app that prompts it to move with certain in-game events, as well as virtually organize and run the whole game.<ref>{{cite web | last = Romain | first = Lindsey | url = https://nerdist.com/article/return-to-dark-tower-kickstarter/ | title = RETURN TO DARK TOWER Updates an Iconic Role-Playing Game | date = January 14, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist.com]]}}</ref> Players are given command over their kingdom that includes their quarter of the game mat, complete with fortresses, communities and locations, which may produce economic resources or be the sites for quests and battles. Each player controls a character called a \"hero\", who may traverse between locations with every turn and retains special starting items and scale-able abilities dictated by a special card.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/an-80s-electronic-game-classic-gets-an-app-driven-reboot-in-return-to-dark-tower/ | title = A cult '80s electronic game gets an app-driven reboot in Return to Dark Tower | date = March 11, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[CNET]]}}</ref> At the end of their turn, the player is to insert a plastic skull - representative of corruption - into an opening at the top of the Tower. When the skulls are released into a kingdom by the Tower, the kingdom's player must allocate them onto their structures and look to use their turns to battle the corruption. The skulls may be released either immediately or when a player is tasked with opening a compartment in the side of the Tower, causing the corruption to be released ''en masse''. Players are allotted with an amount of turns representative of six months - the game becomes increasingly challenging, with more quests to complete, while also contending with the flow of corruption out of the Tower. If the Tower becomes too powerful and overwhelms the kingdoms, the game is lost.<ref name=\"IGNImpressions\">{{cite web | last = Marks | first = Tom | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-dark-tower-first-impressions-and-unboxing-its-massive-mechanical-tower | title = Return to Dark Tower: First Impressions and Unboxing Its Massive Mechanical Tower | date = January 30, 2020 | accessdate = March 24, 2020 | website = [[IGN]]}}</ref> ''Return to Dark Tower'' features two cooperative and game modes, with mindfulness pertaining to the others' kingdoms being crucial.

A strictly competitive game, ''Dark Tower'' pits up to four players against one another, with each player controlling a kingdom identical to the others, encompassing a quarter of the circular map board. At the center of the board is the battery-powered Tower, which contains a small [[membrane keyboard]] beneath a carousel that features a backlit display, depicting any number of pictures. Commanding a single hero game piece for their kingdom, each player inputs their actions and movements into the keyboard, followed by the Tower dictating what events will transpire. If the game determines that the player will face combat, the carousel will rotate and illuminate a picture associated with a foe and the game will determine if the battle is successful and how many troops the players has lost. After each turn, the Tower is to be rotated To win the game, players must obtain three keys within their kingdom, muster their forces and overcome the Tower itself in an attack.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kelly | first = James Floyd | url = https://www.wired.com/2011/06/geekdad-retro-gaming-dark-tower/ | title = GeekDad Retro Gaming: Dark Tower | date = June 30, 2011 | accessdate = April 1, 2020 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Though Milton Bradley was the third-largest toy manufacturer in the United States at the time of the ''Dark Tower'''s release, sales had slowed down, motivating the company to invest heavily in the game's success.

For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU > A & S > Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern's donation===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.
