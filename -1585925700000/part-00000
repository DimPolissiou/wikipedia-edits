Sreedhara 2007\" /> He realised that Dutch power in Kerala stemmed from their flourishing spice trade at the port of [[Kochi]]. He set out to conquer the major spice-producing areas supplying cargo to Kochi. After declaring a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, between then and 1752, the king annexed [[Kollam|Quilon]], [[Kayamkulam]], [[Thekkumkur]], Vadakkumkur and [[Purakkad]] to Travancore (thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch).<ref name=\"Sharma2010\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTTGWSme30YC|title=Coastal Histories: Society and Ecology in Pre-modern India|last1=Sharma|first1=Yogesh|publisher=Primus Books|year=2010|isbn=978-93-80607-00-9|pages=83\u201384}}</ref>\n\n* In 1731, the port of [[Kollam]] (Quilon) - which was ruled by a branch of the Venadu family to which Marthanda Varma also belonged - was defeated and its last chief was made to sign a treaty allowing the annexation of his chiefdom by Travancore after his death. The chief was brought to Trivandrum and lodged almost as a state prisoner in the Valikoikkal Palace. A contingent of the Travancore army under Dalavay Arumukham Pillai was stationed at Kollam.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n\n* Marthanda Varma next turned his attention towards the little chiefdom of Marta and seized it. The neighbouring chiefdom of [[Kayamkulam]] - sensing an imminent invasion by Travancore - soon allied itself with [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]], Purakkad and Vadakkumkur. The Kayamkulam chief was also successful in rescuing the Kollam chief from his Trivandrum prison. The allies built new fortifications and strengthened their defences against the threat of Travancore. The [[Dutch East India Company]] also professed to support the war effort.\n* The subsequent invasion of Marta by the Kayamkulam chief signalled the outbreak of the war. The Travancore army seized Nedumangadu and Kottarakkara and prevented the joined forces of Elayadathu and Kayamkulam. Travancore Dalavay Ramayyan then lead an expeditionary force to capture the city of Kollam. But, he was forced to withdraw without accomplishing his mission.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* Having equipped their forces with the help of the French and the English Companies, Travancore renewed a military operation against the chief of Kollam. In the campaigns that ensued, the ruler of Kayamkulam was killed (1734). But the defence of Kollam continued under the leadership of the brother of the deceased chief and Travancore forces were forced to fall back once again.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* Travancore's next campaign was against Elayadathu Swaroopam ([[Kottarakara]]). When the chief of Kottarakara who was kept in solitary confinement in Trivandrum died in 1739, Marthanda Varma refused to recognise the claim of the senior female member to succession. The princess fled to Thekkumkur where the chief gave granted her asylum. At this juncture, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]] sensed an opportunity to involve further in the politics of Kerala.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* In 1739, van Imhoff arrived in Kochi, took up the cause of the female ruler of Kottarakara and protested against the annexation of that chiefdom by Marthanda Varma in a meeting between the two. In 1741, the Dutch reinstated the female ruler of Kottarakara against the wishes of Marthanda Varma, who attacked the chiefdom and defeated the combined Kottarakkara - Dutch forces before finally fully annexing the chiefdom to Travancore while the female ruler fled to [[Kochi]].<ref name=\"Menon, A.

Eustachius de Lannoy's tomb is located in the chapel cemetery.|left|193x193px]]\n\nTravancore then launched a series of raids on the Dutch forts in the area and captured them all. In retaliation, a Dutch artillery force landed at [[Colachel]] from Ceylon and conquered up to [[Kottar]]. The Dutch forces then advanced against [[Kalkulam]], Travancore's capital. Marthanda Varma, who was then in the north of his state promptly marched his forces to the south and arrived at Kalkulam just in time to prevent its fall to the Dutch.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\"/>\n\nIn the following battle at Colachel (10 August 1741), the Travancore forces won a resounding victory over the Dutch. More than twenty Dutch were taken as prisoners of war from Colachel. Among them was [[Eustachius De Lannoy|Eustachius de Lannoy]], who attracted the king's special notice. Eustachius de Lannoy, commonly known in Travancore as the 'Valiya Kappittan' (Senior Captain) was entrusted with the organisation and drilling of a special regiment, which he did to the \"entire satisfaction of the king\". De Lannoy was raised to the rank of general in Travancore army and proved of considerable service to Marthanda Varma in subsequent battles.\n\n=== Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753) ===\n\n* Following the expulsion of the Dutch, Marthanda Varma now turned his attention once again towards Kayamkulam (which continued to seek help from the Dutch Company). In 1742, Travancore forces attacked Kayamkulam possessions at Kollam and fought the Kayamkulam army led by Achuta Warrier and chiefs from Valiya Kakkanadu Madhom. Although Travancore was defeated in this battle, Marthanada Varma reinforced his army with cavalry brought in from [[Tirunelveli]] before mounting an attack on Kayamkulam, which led to the final defeat of the chiefdom. A treaty known as the [[Treaty of Mannar]] (1742) was signed, under which Kayamkulam became a tributary state of Travancore.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* However, by 1746, the Kayamkulam chief once again showed signs of rebellion and when his \"conspiracies\" with the northern chiefdoms such as [[Kottayam]], [[Changanassery]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]] and [[Ambalapuzha]] came to the attention of Marthanda Varma, Kayamkulam was annexed by a final battle in which the chief fled to Kochi and a branch of the family settled near Charamood known as \"Moothantedom\".<ref name=\"Menon, A.

The tenure was found along with the Otti tenure, similar to the Kanam tenure (found elsewhere in Kerala). A number of commercial crops were cultivated in lands under this tenure. The Kulikkanam cultivators usually went to the market to sell their goods for cash (and hence the Kulikkanam dues were collected as cash).<ref name=\":4\" />\n*The basis for the changes in the political and economic relations was provided by the transformation of the old agrarian relations.<ref name=\":4\" /> Extensive land survey and settlement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n*However it is not to be forgotten that caste suppression on people was at its peak. Notorious practices like the prohibition on both men and women wearing clothes above their waist and below their knees were notable.

He undertook the Prayaschittam retribution that was long over due from the earlier Venadu kings.<ref name=\":4\" /> He reorganised the collection of dues from the temple lands.

Sreedhara 2007\" /> He realised that Dutch power in Kerala stemmed from their flourishing spice trade at the port of [[Kochi]]. He set out to conquer the major spice-producing areas supplying cargo to Kochi. After declaring a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, between then and 1752, the king annexed [[Kollam|Quilon]], [[Kayamkulam]], [[Thekkumkur]], Vadakkumkur and [[Purakkad]] to Travancore (thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch).<ref name=\"Sharma2010\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTTGWSme30YC|title=Coastal Histories: Society and Ecology in Pre-modern India|last1=Sharma|first1=Yogesh|publisher=Primus Books|year=2010|isbn=978-93-80607-00-9|pages=83\u201384}}</ref>\n\n* In 1731, the port of [[Kollam]] (Quilon) - which was ruled by a branch of the Venadu family to which Marthanda Varma also belonged - was defeated and its last chief was made to sign a treaty allowing the annexation of his chiefdom by Travancore after his death. The chief was brought to Trivandrum and lodged almost as a state prisoner in the Valikoikkal Palace. A contingent of the Travancore army under Dalavay Arumukham Pillai was stationed at Kollam.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n\n* Marthanda Varma next turned his attention towards the little chiefdom of Marta and seized it. The neighbouring chiefdom of [[Kayamkulam]] - sensing an imminent invasion by Travancore - soon allied itself with [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]], Purakkad and Vadakkumkur. The Kayamkulam chief was also successful in rescuing the Kollam chief from his Trivandrum prison. The allies built new fortifications and strengthened their defences against the threat of Travancore. The [[Dutch East India Company]] also professed to support the war effort.\n* The subsequent invasion of Marta by the Kayamkulam chief signalled the outbreak of the war. The Travancore army seized Nedumangadu and Kottarakkara and prevented the joined forces of Elayadathu and Kayamkulam. Travancore Dalavay Ramayyan then lead an expeditionary force to capture the city of Kollam. But, he was forced to withdraw without accomplishing his mission.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* Having equipped their forces with the help of the French and the English Companies, Travancore renewed a military operation against the chief of Kollam. In the campaigns that ensued, the ruler of Kayamkulam was killed (1734). But the defence of Kollam continued under the leadership of the brother of the deceased chief and Travancore forces were forced to fall back once again.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* Travancore's next campaign was against Elayadathu Swaroopam ([[Kottarakara]]). When the chief of Kottarakara who was kept in solitary confinement in Trivandrum died in 1739, Marthanda Varma refused to recognise the claim of the senior female member to succession. The princess fled to Thekkumkur where the chief gave granted her asylum. At this juncture, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]] sensed an opportunity to involve further in the politics of Kerala.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* In 1739, van Imhoff arrived in Kochi, took up the cause of the female ruler of Kottarakara and protested against the annexation of that chiefdom by Marthanda Varma in a meeting between the two. In 1741, the Dutch reinstated the female ruler of Kottarakara against the wishes of Marthanda Varma, who attacked the chiefdom and defeated the combined Kottarakkara - Dutch forces before finally fully annexing the chiefdom to Travancore while the female ruler fled to [[Kochi]].<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n\n===Battle of Colachel (1741)===\n{{main article|Battle of Colachel}}\n[[File:De_lannoy_Tomb.JPG|thumbnail|The chapel at [[Udayagiri Fort]], [[Kanyakumari]]. Eustachius de Lannoy's tomb is located in the chapel cemetery.|left|193x193px]]\n\nTravancore then launched a series of raids on the Dutch forts in the area and captured them all. In retaliation, a Dutch artillery force landed at [[Colachel]] from Ceylon and conquered up to [[Kottar]]. The Dutch forces then advanced against [[Kalkulam]], Travancore's capital. Marthanda Varma, who was then in the north of his state promptly marched his forces to the south and arrived at Kalkulam just in time to prevent its fall to the Dutch.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\"/>\n\nIn the following battle at Colachel (10 August 1741), the Travancore forces won a resounding victory over the Dutch. More than twenty Dutch were taken as prisoners of war from Colachel. Among them was [[Eustachius De Lannoy|Eustachius de Lannoy]], who attracted the king's special notice. Eustachius de Lannoy, commonly known in Travancore as the 'Valiya Kappittan' (Senior Captain) was entrusted with the organisation and drilling of a special regiment, which he did to the \"entire satisfaction of the king\". De Lannoy was raised to the rank of general in Travancore army and proved of considerable service to Marthanda Varma in subsequent battles.\n\n=== Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753) ===\n\n* Following the expulsion of the Dutch, Marthanda Varma now turned his attention once again towards Kayamkulam (which continued to seek help from the Dutch Company). In 1742, Travancore forces attacked Kayamkulam possessions at Kollam and fought the Kayamkulam army led by Achuta Warrier and chiefs from Valiya Kakkanadu Madhom. Although Travancore was defeated in this battle, Marthanada Varma reinforced his army with cavalry brought in from [[Tirunelveli]] before mounting an attack on Kayamkulam, which led to the final defeat of the chiefdom. A treaty known as the [[Treaty of Mannar]] (1742) was signed, under which Kayamkulam became a tributary state of Travancore.<ref name=\"Menon, A. Sreedhara 2007\" />\n* However, by 1746, the Kayamkulam chief once again showed signs of rebellion and when his \"conspiracies\" with the northern chiefdoms such as [[Kottayam]], [[Changanassery]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]] and [[Ambalapuzha]] came to the attention of Marthanda Varma, Kayamkulam was annexed by a final battle in which the chief fled to Kochi and a branch of the family settled near Charamood known as \"Moothantedom\".<ref name=\"Menon, A.

The tenure was found along with the Otti tenure, similar to the Kanam tenure (found elsewhere in Kerala). A number of commercial crops were cultivated in lands under this tenure. The Kulikkanam cultivators usually went to the market to sell their goods for cash (and hence the Kulikkanam dues were collected as cash).<ref name=\":4\" />\n*The basis for the changes in the political and economic relations was provided by the transformation of the old agrarian relations.<ref name=\":4\" /> Extensive land survey and settlement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n*However it is not to be forgotten that caste suppression on people was at its peak. Notorious practices like the prohibition on both men and women wearing clothes above their waist and below their knees were notable. Taxes levied for having mustache, umbrella, walking sticks were some of the dark sides during the rule.\n\n==Culture and religion==\nMarthanda Varma started normalising the relation between the royal family (the ruler) and the [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] (the administrative body of the temple) as soon as he came to the throne. He undertook the Prayaschittam retribution that was long over due from the earlier Venadu kings.<ref name=\":4\" /> He reorganised the collection of dues from the temple lands.
