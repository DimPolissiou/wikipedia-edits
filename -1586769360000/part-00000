Its climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. Areas inside the [[Arctic Circle]] (66\u00b034\u2032 latitude) experience some days in summer when the Sun never sets, and some days during the winter when it never rises. The duration of these phases varies from one day for locations right on the Arctic Circle to several months near the Pole, which is the middle of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nBetween the Arctic Circle and the [[Tropic of Cancer]] (23\u00b026\u2032 latitude) lies the [[Northern temperate zone]]. The changes in these regions between summer and winter are generally mild, rather than extreme hot or cold. However, a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather.\n\n[[Tropics|Tropical]] regions (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, 0\u00b0 latitude) are generally hot all year round and tend to experience a [[Wet season|rainy season]] during the summer months, and a [[dry season]] during the winter months.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, objects moving across or above the surface of the Earth tend to turn to the right because of the [[Coriolis effect]]. As a result, large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to form clockwise-turning [[Ocean gyre|gyres]]. These are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]] oceans.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nFor the same reason, flows of air down toward the northern surface of the Earth tend to spread across the surface in a clockwise pattern. Thus, clockwise air circulation is characteristic of [[high pressure]] weather cells in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, air rising from the northern surface of the Earth (creating a region of low pressure) tends to draw air toward it in a counter-clockwise pattern. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] (massive low-pressure systems) spin counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe shadow of a sundial moves clockwise on latitudes north of the [[subsolar point]]. During the day on these latitudes, the Sun tends to rise to its maximum at a southerly position. Between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the sun can be seen to the north, directly overhead, or to the south at noon dependent on the time of year. In the Southern Hemisphere the midday Sun is predominantly at north.\n\nWhen viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the [[Moon]] appears inverted compared to a view from the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/our-solar-system/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/135-does-the-moon-look-different-in-the-northern-and-southern-hemispheres-beginner|title=Does the Moon look different in the northern and southern hemispheres?

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981.

Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

Filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. In January 2019, it was announced that the 20-episode sixth season, which was ordered on September 12, 2017, ahead of its fifth-season premiere, would be the final season of the series. The sixth season premiered on December 4, 2019. A sequel series, titled ''Vikings: Valhalla'', is in development for [[Netflix]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n''Vikings'' is inspired by the [[saga]]s of [[Vikings|Viking]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]], one of the best-known legendary [[Norse mythology|Norse]] heroes and notorious as the scourge of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and [[West Francia|France]]. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes a [[Scandinavia]]n King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the [[Norsemen]] of [[early medieval]] [[Scandinavia]]. It broadly follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] and his crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagas ''[[Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]]'' and ''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'', as well as in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s 12th-century work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Norse [[legendary sagas]] were partially fictional tales based in the Norse [[oral tradition]], written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] depicted in the second episode, or [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th-century account of the [[Varangians]]. The series begins at the start of the [[Viking Age]], marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Vikings characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Travis Fimmel]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Ragnar Lothbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] (seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Lagertha|Lagertha]]\n* [[Clive Standen]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Rollo|Rollo]] (seasons 1\u20134;

Filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. In January 2019, it was announced that the 20-episode sixth season, which was ordered on September 12, 2017, ahead of its fifth-season premiere, would be the final season of the series. The sixth season premiered on December 4, 2019. A sequel series, titled ''Vikings: Valhalla'', is in development for [[Netflix]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n''Vikings'' is inspired by the [[saga]]s of [[Vikings|Viking]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]], one of the best-known legendary [[Norse mythology|Norse]] heroes and notorious as the scourge of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and [[West Francia|France]]. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes a [[Scandinavia]]n King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the [[Norsemen]] of [[early medieval]] [[Scandinavia]]. It broadly follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] and his crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagas ''[[Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]]'' and ''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'', as well as in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s 12th-century work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Norse [[legendary sagas]] were partially fictional tales based in the Norse [[oral tradition]], written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] depicted in the second episode, or [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th-century account of the [[Varangians]]. The series begins at the start of the [[Viking Age]], marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Vikings characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Travis Fimmel]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Ragnar Lothbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] (seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Lagertha|Lagertha]]\n* [[Clive Standen]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Rollo|Rollo]] (seasons 1\u20134;
