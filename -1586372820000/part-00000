He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

His government also saw the [[abolition of slavery]] in the British Empire, in which the government purchased slaves from their owners in 1833. Grey was a strong opponent of the foreign and domestic policies of [[William Pitt the Younger]] in the 1790s.  In 1807, he resigned as foreign secretary to protest the King's uncompromising rejection of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Grey finally resigned in 1834 over disagreements in his cabinet regarding Ireland, and retired from politics. His biographer [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n{{quote|in our domestic history 1832 is the next great landmark after [[Glorious Revolution|1688]]&nbsp;...

He was educated at [[Richmond School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fretwell.kangaweb.com.au/pdfs/Edward%20Kay.pdf |title=Info |website=fretwell.kangaweb.com.au }}</ref> followed by [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=GRY781C|name=Grey, Charles}}</ref> acquiring a facility in Latin and in English composition and declamation that enabled him to become one of the foremost parliamentary orators of his generation.\n\n==Titles==\nHe became the second [[Earl Grey]], Viscount Howick and Baron Grey of Howick on 14 November 1807 upon the death of his father. Upon the death of his uncle on 30 March 1808 he became the third Baronet Grey of Howick.\n\n==Government career==\n\n===Elected to Parliament, 1786===\nGrey was elected to Parliament for the [[Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Northumberland constituency]] on 14 September 1786, aged just 22. He became a part of the Whig circle of [[Charles James Fox]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], and the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], and soon became one of the major leaders of the Whig party. He was the youngest manager on the committee for prosecuting [[Warren Hastings]]. The Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|T. B. Macaulay]] wrote in 1841:\n{{quote|At an age when most of those who distinguish themselves in life are still contending for prizes and fellowships at college, he had won for himself a conspicuous place in Parliament. No advantage of fortune or connection was wanting that could set off to the height his splendid talents and his unblemished honour. At twenty-three he had been thought worthy to be ranked with the veteran statesmen who appeared as the delegates of the British Commons, at the bar of the British nobility. All who stood at that bar, save him alone, are gone, culprit, advocates, accusers. To the generation which is now in the vigour of life, he is the sole representative of a great age which has passed away. But those who, within the last ten years, have listened with delight, till the morning sun shone on the tapestries of the House of Lords, to the lofty and animated eloquence of Charles Earl Grey, are able to form some estimate of the powers of a race of men among whom he was not the foremost.<ref>Thomas Babington Macaulay, [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/hastings/txt_complete.html \u2018Warren Hastings\u2019], ''Edinburgh Review'' LXXIV (October 1841), pp. 160\u2013255.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Charles Grey (1764-1845), by Henry Bone.jpg|thumb|Grey in a blue coat, white waistcoat and tied cravat, and powdered hair, by Henry Bone (after Thomas Lawrence), August 1794.]]\nGrey was also noted for advocating Parliamentary reform and [[Catholic emancipation]]. His affair with the [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Devonshire]], herself an active political campaigner, did him little harm although it nearly caused her to be divorced by her husband.\n\n===Foreign Secretary, 1806\u201307===\n\nIn 1806, Grey, by then Lord Howick owing to his father's elevation to the peerage as [[Earl Grey]], became a part of the [[Ministry of All the Talents]] (a coalition of [[Foxite]] Whigs, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Grenvillites]], and [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addingtonites]]) as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]].\n\nFollowing Fox's death later that year, Howick took over both as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and as leader of the Whigs.  The ministry broke up in 1807 when [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] blocked Catholic Emancipation legislation and required that all ministers individually sign a pledge, which Howick refused to do, that they would not, \"propose any further concessions to the Catholics.\"<ref>Smith paperback 1996 p125</ref>\n\n===Years in Opposition, 1807\u201330===\n[[File:Charon's Boat.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of naked British Whig politicians, including three Grenvilles, Sheridan, St. Vincent, Moira, Temple, Erskine, Howick, Petty, Whitbread, Sheridan, Windham,and Tomline, Bishop of Lincoln, crossing the river Styx in a boat named the Broad Bottom Packet.

He continued in opposition for the next 23 years.  There were times during this period when Grey came close to joining the Government.  In 1811, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|the Prince Regent]] tried to court Grey and his ally [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|William Grenville]] to join the [[Spencer Perceval]] ministry following the resignation of [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]].

In 1831, he was made a member of the [[Order of the Garter]]. His term was a notable one, seeing passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]], which finally saw the reform of the House of Commons, and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1833. As the years had passed, however, Grey had become more conservative, and he was cautious about initiating more far-reaching reforms, particularly since he knew that [[William IV of England|the King]] was at best only a reluctant supporter of reform.\n\nGrey contributed to a plan to [[European settlement of South Australia|found a new colony in South Australia]]: in 1831 a \"Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia\" was prepared under the auspices of  [[Robert Gouger]], [[Anthony Bacon (British Army officer)|Anthony Bacon]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Grey, but its ideas were considered too radical, and it was unable to attract the required investment.<ref name=samem>{{cite web|website=SA Memory|url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=349&startRow=13|publisher=State Library of South Australia|title=Foundation of the Province|date=5 February 2015|access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was the issue of Ireland which precipitated the end of Grey's premiership in 1834.  Lord Anglesey, the Viceroy of Ireland, preferred conciliatory reform including the partial redistribution of the income from the church tithe to the Catholic church and away from the established Protestant one, a policy known as \u201cappropriation\u201d.<ref>Smith paperback 1996 pp 288\u201393</ref>  The Chief Secretary for Ireland, [[Edward Geoffrey Smith Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], however, preferred coercive measures.<ref>Smith paperback 1996 p301</ref>  The cabinet was divided and when [[Lord John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] drew attention in the House of Commons to their differences over \"appropriation\", Stanley and others resigned.<ref>Smith paperback pp 304\u20135</ref>  This triggered Grey to retire from public life, leaving [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] as his successor.  Unlike most politicians, he seems to have genuinely preferred a private life; colleagues remarked caustically that he threatened to resign at every setback.\n\nGrey returned to Howick but kept a close eye on the policies of the new cabinet under Melbourne, whom he, and especially his family, regarded as a mere understudy until he began to act in ways of which they disapproved. Grey became more critical as the decade went on, being particularly inclined to see the hand of [[Daniel O'Connell]] behind the scenes and blaming Melbourne for subservience to the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] with whom he identified the Irish patriot. He made no allowances for Melbourne's need to keep the radicals on his side to preserve his shrinking majority in the Commons, and in particular he resented any slight on his own great achievement, the Reform Act, which he saw as a final solution of the question for the foreseeable future. He continually stressed its conservative nature. As he declared in his last great public speech, at the Grey Festival organised in his honour at [[Edinburgh]] in September 1834, its purpose was to strengthen and preserve the established constitution, to make it more acceptable to the people at large, and especially the middle classes, who had been the principal beneficiaries of the Reform Act, and to establish the principle that future changes would be gradual, \"according to the increased intelligence of the people, and the necessities of the times\".<ref>''Edinburgh Weekly Journal'', 17 September 1834.</ref> It was the speech of a conservative statesman.<ref name=\"ODNB\">E.

Before he married Mary, his engagement to her nearly suffered because of his affair with [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]]. The young Grey met Georgiana sometime in the late 1780s to early 1790s while attending a Whig society meeting in [[Devonshire House]]. Grey and Georgiana became lovers, and in 1791 she became pregnant. Grey wanted Georgiana to leave her husband the duke and live with him, but the duke told Georgiana if she did, she would never see her children again. Georgiana was sent to France where, on 20 February 1792 in [[Aix-en-Provence]], she gave birth to a daughter, whom she named [[Eliza Courtney]]. She returned to England with the child in September 1793, and entrusted her to Grey's parents, who raised her as though she were his sister.\n\nGeorgiana and Charles spent time with their daughter, who was informed of her true parentage some time after Georgiana's death in 1806. She married General [[Robert Ellice]]. Her maternal aunt, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]], visited the Greys in 1808 (without knowing she was Eliza's aunt) and later wrote of her strange observations in which she stated \"he (Charles) seems very fond of her\". Eliza later named her youngest child Charles and named her eldest daughter Georgiana.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:The Grave of Earl Grey - geograph.org.uk - 385392.jpg|thumb|Grave at [[Howick Hall]] in \tHowick, Northumberland]]\nGrey spent his last years in contented, if sometimes fretful, retirement at Howick with his books, his family, and his dogs. The one great personal blow he suffered in old age  was the death of his favourite grandson, Charles, at the age of 13.

July 1845), known as '''Viscount Howick''' between 1806 and 1807, was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from November 1830 to July 1834.\n\nA member of the [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]], he was a long-time leader of multiple [[reform movement]]s, most famously the [[Reform Act 1832]]. His government also saw the [[abolition of slavery]] in the British Empire, in which the government purchased slaves from their owners in 1833. Grey was a strong opponent of the foreign and domestic policies of [[William Pitt the Younger]] in the 1790s.  In 1807, he resigned as foreign secretary to protest the King's uncompromising rejection of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Grey finally resigned in 1834 over disagreements in his cabinet regarding Ireland, and retired from politics. His biographer [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n{{quote|in our domestic history 1832 is the next great landmark after [[Glorious Revolution|1688]]&nbsp;...

Durham. He had four brothers and two sisters. He was educated at [[Richmond School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fretwell.kangaweb.com.au/pdfs/Edward%20Kay.pdf |title=Info |website=fretwell.kangaweb.com.au }}</ref> followed by [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=GRY781C|name=Grey, Charles}}</ref> acquiring a facility in Latin and in English composition and declamation that enabled him to become one of the foremost parliamentary orators of his generation.\n\n==Titles==\nHe became the second [[Earl Grey]], Viscount Howick and Baron Grey of Howick on 14 November 1807 upon the death of his father. Upon the death of his uncle on 30 March 1808 he became the third Baronet Grey of Howick.\n\n==Government career==\n\n===Elected to Parliament, 1786===\nGrey was elected to Parliament for the [[Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Northumberland constituency]] on 14 September 1786, aged just 22. He became a part of the Whig circle of [[Charles James Fox]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], and the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], and soon became one of the major leaders of the Whig party. He was the youngest manager on the committee for prosecuting [[Warren Hastings]]. The Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|T. B. Macaulay]] wrote in 1841:\n{{quote|At an age when most of those who distinguish themselves in life are still contending for prizes and fellowships at college, he had won for himself a conspicuous place in Parliament. No advantage of fortune or connection was wanting that could set off to the height his splendid talents and his unblemished honour. At twenty-three he had been thought worthy to be ranked with the veteran statesmen who appeared as the delegates of the British Commons, at the bar of the British nobility. All who stood at that bar, save him alone, are gone, culprit, advocates, accusers. To the generation which is now in the vigour of life, he is the sole representative of a great age which has passed away. But those who, within the last ten years, have listened with delight, till the morning sun shone on the tapestries of the House of Lords, to the lofty and animated eloquence of Charles Earl Grey, are able to form some estimate of the powers of a race of men among whom he was not the foremost.<ref>Thomas Babington Macaulay, [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/hastings/txt_complete.html \u2018Warren Hastings\u2019], ''Edinburgh Review'' LXXIV (October 1841), pp. 160\u2013255.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Charles Grey (1764-1845), by Henry Bone.jpg|thumb|Grey in a blue coat, white waistcoat and tied cravat, and powdered hair, by Henry Bone (after Thomas Lawrence), August 1794.]]\nGrey was also noted for advocating Parliamentary reform and [[Catholic emancipation]]. His affair with the [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Devonshire]], herself an active political campaigner, did him little harm although it nearly caused her to be divorced by her husband.\n\n===Foreign Secretary, 1806\u201307===\n\nIn 1806, Grey, by then Lord Howick owing to his father's elevation to the peerage as [[Earl Grey]], became a part of the [[Ministry of All the Talents]] (a coalition of [[Foxite]] Whigs, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Grenvillites]], and [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addingtonites]]) as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]].\n\nFollowing Fox's death later that year, Howick took over both as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and as leader of the Whigs.  The ministry broke up in 1807 when [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] blocked Catholic Emancipation legislation and required that all ministers individually sign a pledge, which Howick refused to do, that they would not, \"propose any further concessions to the Catholics.\"<ref>Smith paperback 1996 p125</ref>\n\n===Years in Opposition, 1807\u201330===\n[[File:Charon's Boat.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of naked British Whig politicians, including three Grenvilles, Sheridan, St. Vincent, Moira, Temple, Erskine, Howick, Petty, Whitbread, Sheridan, Windham,and Tomline, Bishop of Lincoln, crossing the river Styx in a boat named the Broad Bottom Packet.

He continued in opposition for the next 23 years.  There were times during this period when Grey came close to joining the Government.  In 1811, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|the Prince Regent]] tried to court Grey and his ally [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|William Grenville]] to join the [[Spencer Perceval]] ministry following the resignation of [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]].

In 1831, he was made a member of the [[Order of the Garter]]. His term was a notable one, seeing passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]], which finally saw the reform of the House of Commons, and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1833. As the years had passed, however, Grey had become more conservative, and he was cautious about initiating more far-reaching reforms, particularly since he knew that [[William IV of England|the King]] was at best only a reluctant supporter of reform.\n\nGrey contributed to a plan to [[European settlement of South Australia|found a new colony in South Australia]]: in 1831 a \"Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia\" was prepared under the auspices of  [[Robert Gouger]], [[Anthony Bacon (British Army officer)|Anthony Bacon]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Grey, but its ideas were considered too radical, and it was unable to attract the required investment.<ref name=samem>{{cite web|website=SA Memory|url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=349&startRow=13|publisher=State Library of South Australia|title=Foundation of the Province|date=5 February 2015|access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was the issue of Ireland which precipitated the end of Grey's premiership in 1834.  Lord Anglesey, the Viceroy of Ireland, preferred conciliatory reform including the partial redistribution of the income from the church tithe to the Catholic church and away from the established Protestant one, a policy known as \u201cappropriation\u201d.<ref>Smith paperback 1996 pp 288\u201393</ref>  The Chief Secretary for Ireland, [[Edward Geoffrey Smith Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], however, preferred coercive measures.<ref>Smith paperback 1996 p301</ref>  The cabinet was divided and when [[Lord John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] drew attention in the House of Commons to their differences over \"appropriation\", Stanley and others resigned.<ref>Smith paperback pp 304\u20135</ref>  This triggered Grey to retire from public life, leaving [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] as his successor.  Unlike most politicians, he seems to have genuinely preferred a private life; colleagues remarked caustically that he threatened to resign at every setback.\n\nGrey returned to Howick but kept a close eye on the policies of the new cabinet under Melbourne, whom he, and especially his family, regarded as a mere understudy until he began to act in ways of which they disapproved. Grey became more critical as the decade went on, being particularly inclined to see the hand of [[Daniel O'Connell]] behind the scenes and blaming Melbourne for subservience to the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] with whom he identified the Irish patriot. He made no allowances for Melbourne's need to keep the radicals on his side to preserve his shrinking majority in the Commons, and in particular he resented any slight on his own great achievement, the Reform Act, which he saw as a final solution of the question for the foreseeable future. He continually stressed its conservative nature. As he declared in his last great public speech, at the Grey Festival organised in his honour at [[Edinburgh]] in September 1834, its purpose was to strengthen and preserve the established constitution, to make it more acceptable to the people at large, and especially the middle classes, who had been the principal beneficiaries of the Reform Act, and to establish the principle that future changes would be gradual, \"according to the increased intelligence of the people, and the necessities of the times\".<ref>''Edinburgh Weekly Journal'', 17 September 1834.</ref> It was the speech of a conservative statesman.<ref name=\"ODNB\">E.

Henry Cavendish Grey (16 October 1814 \u2013 5 September 1880)\n*William George Grey (15 February 1819 \u2013 19 December 1865). He married Theresa Stedink on 20 September 1858.\n\nHe also had an illegitimate daughter with [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]]:\n*[[Eliza Courtney]] (20 February 1792 \u2013 2 May 1859). She married [[Robert Ellice|General Robert Ellice]] on 10 December 1814.\n\n[[File:Inscription Grey Monument.jpg|thumb|Inscription on [[Grey's Monument]]]]\n\n===Relationship with Georgiana Cavendish===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nWhile [[Mary Grey, Countess Grey|Mary]] was frequently pregnant during their marriage and remained at home, Grey travelled alone and had affairs with other women. Before he married Mary, his engagement to her nearly suffered because of his affair with [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]]. The young Grey met Georgiana sometime in the late 1780s to early 1790s while attending a Whig society meeting in [[Devonshire House]]. Grey and Georgiana became lovers, and in 1791 she became pregnant. Grey wanted Georgiana to leave her husband the duke and live with him, but the duke told Georgiana if she did, she would never see her children again. Georgiana was sent to France where, on 20 February 1792 in [[Aix-en-Provence]], she gave birth to a daughter, whom she named [[Eliza Courtney]]. She returned to England with the child in September 1793, and entrusted her to Grey's parents, who raised her as though she were his sister.\n\nGeorgiana and Charles spent time with their daughter, who was informed of her true parentage some time after Georgiana's death in 1806. She married General [[Robert Ellice]]. Her maternal aunt, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]], visited the Greys in 1808 (without knowing she was Eliza's aunt) and later wrote of her strange observations in which she stated \"he (Charles) seems very fond of her\". Eliza later named her youngest child Charles and named her eldest daughter Georgiana.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:The Grave of Earl Grey - geograph.org.uk - 385392.jpg|thumb|Grave at [[Howick Hall]] in \tHowick, Northumberland]]\nGrey spent his last years in contented, if sometimes fretful, retirement at Howick with his books, his family, and his dogs. The one great personal blow he suffered in old age  was the death of his favourite grandson, Charles, at the age of 13. Grey became physically feeble in his last years and died quietly in his bed on 17 July 1845, forty-four years to the day since going to live at Howick.<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: SEP 1845 XXV 130 ALNWICK</ref> He was buried in the [[St Michael and All Angels Church (Howick, Northumberland)|Church of St Michael and All Angels]] there on the 26th in the presence of his family, close friends, and the labourers on his estate.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nCharles Grey is portrayed by [[Dominic Cooper]] in the 2008 film ''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'', directed by [[Saul Dibb]] and starring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. The film is based on [[Amanda Foreman (biographer)|Amanda Foreman's]] biography of [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]].\n\n===Commemoration and tea===\n[[File:Cup of Earl Gray.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Earl Grey tea]] is named after Grey]]\n[[Earl Grey tea]], a blend which uses [[Bergamot essential oil|bergamot oil]] to flavour the brew, is named after Grey.<ref>{{cite news | last = Wallop | first = Harry | title = Lady Grey tea: fact file   | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8411595/Lady-Grey-tea-fact-file.html   | accessdate = 18 October 2012| date = 2011-03-28 }}</ref>\n\nGrey is commemorated by [[Grey's Monument]] in the centre of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], which consists of a [[statue]] of Lord Grey standing atop a {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[column]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The monument was once struck by lightning and Earl Grey's head was seen lying in the gutter in Grey Street.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The monument lends its name to [[Monument Metro station]] on the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] (at that point effectively Newcastle's 'underground' system), located directly underneath.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Grey Street, Newcastle|Grey Street]] in Newcastle upon Tyne and [[Grey College, Durham]] are also named after Grey.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brett, Peter. \"Grey, Charles, 2nd Earl Grey\" in {{cite book|author=D.

He was educated at [[Truro School]] and at the [[University of East Anglia]] where he was one of the first 105 students admitted, and where he founded the Dramatic Society. After teaching at [[Watton, Norfolk|Watton]] County Secondary School in Norfolk, he won a place at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].\n\n==Career==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Sallah.gif|thumb|left|Rhys-Davies as [[Sallah]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'']] -->\nHe appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster Laughing Spam Fritter opposite [[Adam Faith]] in ''[[Budgie (TV series)|Budgie]]''. Later he played [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian]] officer [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]] in ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Shogun]]'', based on the novel by [[James Clavell]], and as [[Sallah]] in two of the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films. In 1989, he played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in The Trial of the Incredible Hulk. Rhys-Davies also starred in another Clavell adaption, ''[[Noble House (miniseries)|Noble House]]'', set in Hong Kong, in which he plays Ian Dunross' corporate enemy, Quillian Gornt. He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series ''[[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' as well as a leading role in the television series ''[[Sliders]]'' as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997. \n\nHe also appeared in ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]'' in 1983, made several appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' as a [[holodeck]] version of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], starred as an ally of [[James Bond]] in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and appeared in the film ''[[One Night with the King]]''. Davies has played the character [[Porthos]] in two separate projects; a two-part episode of ''[[The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne]]'', and the Hallmark Channel film ''[[La Femme Musketeer]]''. He appears in the [[full motion video]] [[cut scene]]s of computer games including ''[[Ripper (computer game)|Ripper]]'' (as Vigo Haman) (1996), ''[[Dune 2000]]'' (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' series (as [[General James Taggart (Wing Commander)|James Taggart]], doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).\n\nIn 2004, he narrated ''The Privileged Planet'', a documentary that makes the case for [[intelligent design]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002E34C0 |title=The Privileged Planet: John Rhys-Davies, Lad Allen: Movies & TV |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he appeared in the family history programme ''[[Coming Home (UK TV series)|Coming Home]]'', in which he discovered information about his grandfather's life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.<ref name=\"cominghome\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03kkf0w |accessdate=5 January 2014|title=BBC One \u2013 Coming Home, Series 8, John Rhys-Davies}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the television show ''[[M\u00e9tal Hurlant Chronicles|Metal Hurlant Chronicles]]'' to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclu: de nouvelles photos de la saison 2 de \"Metal Hurlant\" [PHOTOS] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18627124.html |website=AlloCin\u00e9 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game ''[[Star Citizen]]'' alongside [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Gary Oldman]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Star Citizen features Gary Oldman, Gillian Anderson, Mark Hamill |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen-features-gary-oldman-gillian-anderson-mark-hamill/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> The work consisted of full body [[motion capture]], including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at [[the Imaginarium]] studios in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Shows How Star Citizen intends to Use Motion Capture |url=http://www.loadthegame.com/2015/02/21/video-shows-star-citizen-intends-use-motion-capture/ |website=Load the Game |accessdate=30 November 2015 |first=Kieran |last=Mackintosh}}</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy===\nHe is also known for his popular portrayal of the dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.

When asked whether he would consider returning to the role for the [[The Hobbit (film series)|film version of ''The Hobbit'']], he said, \"I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.\" He added that this time around \"They've got a different set of problems... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them...

When using [[calcium chloride]] or [[potassium chloride]], the products contain calcium or potassium instead of sodium. Related processes are known that use molten NaCl to give chlorine and sodium metal or condensed [[hydrogen chloride]] to give hydrogen and chlorine.\n\nThe process has a high energy consumption, for example around 2500 kWh of electricity per tonne of sodium hydroxide produced. Because the process yields [[Equivalent_(chemistry)|equivalent]] amounts of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (two moles of sodium hydroxide per mole of chlorine), it is necessary to find a use for these products in the same proportion. For every mole of chlorine produced, one mole of hydrogen is produced. Much of this hydrogen is used to produce [[hydrochloric acid]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], or is combusted for power and/or steam production.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[R. Norris Shreve]]|author2=[[Joseph Brink]]|title=Chemical Process Industries|date=1977|page=219|edition=4th|ASIN=B000OFVCCG}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]\n\n==Process systems==\nThree production methods are in use. While the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] cell method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, the use of several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed.\n\nThe performance of these devices is governed by the considerations of [[electrochemical engineering]].\n\n===Membrane cell===\nThe most common chloralkali process involves the electrolysis of [[aqueous]] [[sodium chloride]] (a brine) in a [[Sodium hydroxide#Production|membrane cell]]. A membrane, such as one made from [[Nafion#Chlor-alkali_production_cell_membrane|Nafion]], is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions.\n\n[[Image:Chloralkali_membrane.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Basic membrane cell used in the [[electrolysis]] of brine. At the anode ('''A'''), chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane ('''B''') allows the counterion Na+ to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode ('''C'''), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The net process is the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl into industrially useful products sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas.]]\n\nSaturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell where the [[chloride]] ions are [[redox|oxidised]] at the [[anode]], losing electrons to become [[chlorine]] gas ('''A''' in figure):\n:2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + 2[[electron|e<sup>\u2212</sup>]]\n\nAt the [[cathode]], positive [[hydrogen ion]]s pulled from water molecules are [[redox|reduced]] by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing [[hydroxide]] ions into the solution ('''C''' in figure):\n:2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe ion-permeable [[ion exchange membrane]] at the center of the cell allows the [[sodium]] ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce [[caustic soda]] (NaOH) ('''B''' in figure).<ref name = Du/> The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus:\n:2NaCl + 2{{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2}} + 2NaOH\n\n===Diaphragm cell===\nIn the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of [[asbestos|asbestos fibers]]. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.\n\n===Mercury cell===\n{{main|Castner\u2013Kellner process}}\n[[File:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Mercury cell for chloralkali process]]\n\nIn the mercury-cell process, also known as the [[Castner\u2013Kellner process]], a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a [[Sodium amalgam|sodium-mercury amalgam]] with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about [[mercury poisoning]] from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see [[Ontario Minamata disease]]) and Japan (see [[Minamata disease]]).\n\n==Unpartitioned cell==\nWithout a membrane, the chlorine and hydroxide ions react, and the chlorine [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to form chloride and [[hypochlorite]] ions:\n:{{chem|Cl|2}} + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + ClO<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nAbove about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[chlorate]] can be formed:\n:3{{chem|Cl|2}} + 6OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 5Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3{{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nIf current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will [[corrosion|dissolve]] in unpartitioned cells.\n\nIf producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% [[Sodium chromate|sodium]] or [[potassium chromate]] to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.<ref name=\"Thom1911\">{{cite book |title=Applied Electrochemistry |author=Thompson, M. de Kay |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1911 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom/page/89 89]-90 |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom}}</ref>\n\n==Electrodes==\nDue to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal<ref name=\"Faraday1849\">{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |year=1849 |title=Experimental Researches In Electricity |volume=1 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14986/14986-h/14986-h.htm |location=London |publisher=The University of London |author-link=Michael Faraday}}</ref>, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time)<ref name=\"Faraday1849\" />, platinized titanium<ref name=\"Land1972\">{{cite journal |title=Anodic chlorate formation on platinized titanium |author=Landolt, D.; Ibl, N. |journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=201-210 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Ltd. |doi=10.1007/BF02354977}}</ref>.

A membrane, such as one made from [[Nafion#Chlor-alkali_production_cell_membrane|Nafion]], is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions.\n\n[[Image:Chloralkali_membrane.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Basic membrane cell used in the [[electrolysis]] of brine. At the anode ('''A'''), chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane ('''B''') allows the counterion Na+ to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode ('''C'''), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The net process is the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl into industrially useful products sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas.]]\n\nSaturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell where the [[chloride]] ions are [[redox|oxidised]] at the [[anode]], losing electrons to become [[chlorine]] gas ('''A''' in figure):\n:2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + 2[[electron|e<sup>\u2212</sup>]]\n\nAt the [[cathode]], positive [[hydrogen ion]]s pulled from water molecules are [[redox|reduced]] by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing [[hydroxide]] ions into the solution ('''C''' in figure):\n:2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe ion-permeable [[ion exchange membrane]] at the center of the cell allows the [[sodium]] ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce [[caustic soda]] (NaOH) ('''B''' in figure).<ref name = Du/> The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus:\n:2NaCl + 2{{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2}} + 2NaOH\n\n===Diaphragm cell===\nIn the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of [[asbestos|asbestos fibers]]. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.\n\n===Mercury cell===\n{{main|Castner\u2013Kellner process}}\n[[File:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Mercury cell for chloralkali process]]\n\nIn the mercury-cell process, also known as the [[Castner\u2013Kellner process]], a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a [[Sodium amalgam|sodium-mercury amalgam]] with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about [[mercury poisoning]] from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see [[Ontario Minamata disease]]) and Japan (see [[Minamata disease]]).\n\n==Unpartitioned cell==\nWithout a membrane, the chlorine and hydroxide ions react, and the chlorine [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to form chloride and [[hypochlorite]] ions:\n:{{chem|Cl|2}} + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + ClO<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nAbove about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[chlorate]] can be formed:\n:3{{chem|Cl|2}} + 6OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 5Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3{{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nIf current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will [[corrosion|dissolve]] in unpartitioned cells.\n\nIf producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% [[Sodium chromate|sodium]] or [[potassium chromate]] to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.<ref name=\"Thom1911\">{{cite book |title=Applied Electrochemistry |author=Thompson, M. de Kay |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1911 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom/page/89 89]-90 |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom}}</ref>\n\n==Electrodes==\nDue to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal<ref name=\"Faraday1849\">{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |year=1849 |title=Experimental Researches In Electricity |volume=1 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14986/14986-h/14986-h.htm |location=London |publisher=The University of London |author-link=Michael Faraday}}</ref>, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time)<ref name=\"Faraday1849\" />, platinized titanium<ref name=\"Land1972\">{{cite journal |title=Anodic chlorate formation on platinized titanium |author=Landolt, D.; Ibl, N. |journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=201-210 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Ltd. |doi=10.1007/BF02354977}}</ref>.
