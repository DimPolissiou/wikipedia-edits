The book collects letters he received from John F.

The tabloid press frequently speculates that Donovan is gay and [[closeted]]; when gossip regarding Donovan soliciting male prostitutes makes headlines, his correspondence with Turner is made public, sparking malicious speculation about the nature of Turner and Donovan's relationship. Donovan writes his final letter to Turner, and dies shortly after. \n\nIn the present, Turner says he does not know whether or not Donovan's death was related to the scandal.

Newhouse muses that she initially dismissed Turner's book as \"[[First World problem|mishaps from the First World]],\" but has reconsidered based on their meeting.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kit Harington]] as John F.

The film was originally released as a mini-series of several episodes which was later edited to create the theatrical version. Both versions follow the basic storyline structure, although the mini-series provides richer detail and background for the main characters and the antagonists.\n\nThe film remains relatively obscure to the general public, although over the years it has gained a large [[cult following]] among martial arts cinema enthusiasts.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo sewage workers, Jack Do ([[Alexander Lou]]) and Charlie Wu (Charlema Hsu), get mixed up in heavy business when their mobster boss is assassinated by another mobster who wants to control [[Shanghai]] and overflow the streets with [[opium]], along with the usual mafia-related affairs such as [[gambling]] and [[prostitution]]. He is aided by a team of four professional assassins, the most notable two being foreigners: one an african american fighter called Mr. Jones (Eugene Thomas), the other an Italian knife throwing expert called Mimo (Silvio Azzolini). The other two are a japanese swordsman named Fuji and a ninjitsu [[kusarigama]] master confusingly also called Mimo.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*'''[[Alexander Lou]]''' as Jack Do:<br /> \nA poor young man who arrives to Shanghai and finds work as a sewage collector, after befriending the local Charlie. After saving the life of William Chung, Jack's fortunes change and he becomes part of ''The Organization'' as Chung's bodyguard and a threat to Hikari's japanese crime syndicate.\n\n*'''Charlema Hsu''' as Charlie Wu:<br /> \nA sewage worker from Shanghai, who befriends Jack and later become members of ''The Organization'', to protect innocent people from the threats of the japanese Ninja criminal syndicate. Despite behaving cowardly in the face of danger, he is a loyal friend and a very capable and skilled fighter. Originally Baisheng ({{zh|s={{linktext| \u767e\u52dd}}|p=B\u01ceish\u00e8ng|l=}}) in the chinese dub, his name is a intentional pun that means \"a hundred victories\"\n\n*'''Wang Hsieh''' as William Chung:<br />\nThe fatherly and kind leader of the Shanghai [[Tiandihui|''Organization'']], which he employs to protect the innocent and uphold justice. He hires Jack and Charlie after they foil an attempt on his life.\n\n*'''Silvio Azzolini''' as Mimo:<br />\nAn italian assassin, a master of knife throwing and a supreme master of ''Kungfu''. He is hired by Hikari to work for his crime syndicate and takes part in the plot to assassinate William Chung.\n\n*'''H\u00fa Xu\u011b-r\u00e9n''' (Sliver How) as Susan:<br />\nA japanese young woman who is in love with Jack, who she met by chance. Meek and kind hearted, she's secretly a member of the Ninja crime syndicate and Hikari's sister. Susan is a very skilled and powerful assassin, and forced by his brother to commit crimes against her will.\n\n*'''Eugene Thomas''' as Mr. Jones:<br />\nAn american fighter and hitman, he is hired by the Japanese crime syndicate to assassinate William Chung. His friendly personality hides his lethal skills. In the original chinese dub, he is called H\u0113igu\u01d0 ({{zh|s={{linktext|\u9ed2\u9b3c}}|p=h\u0113igu\u01d0|l=Black demon}}) by Jack and Charlie.\n\n*'''Tong Lung''' as Hikari :<br />\nThe ruthless leader of the japanese crime syndicate, who aims to take over Shanghai.

Both versions follow the basic storyline structure, although the mini-series provides richer detail and background for the main characters and the antagonists.\n\nAlthough the storyline both the series and the film share is basically the same, some changes were made to the story when producing the film version, in order to condense the story, adding and removing certain scenes as needed. Reshoots took place in order to bring coherence and continuity to the film version and accommodate the narrative to the modifications made for the theatrical release. In the film, large portions of footage from the series, irrelevant to the overall narrative, are absent and long, new sequences were shot to replace them. \n\nCertain characters, such as Charlie's love interest in the series is entirely absent in the film, and other characters, such as Hikari's sister Susan, have greatly expanded roles in the film, while others that are far more relevant in the series, such as the \"Mafia brothers\" or Mimo the assassin, have their roles diminished to some extent in the film. A key difference of the film from the series is the presence in the latter of an additional main villain, who pulls the strings of the events of the story and to whom Hikari the japanese mobster is subordinate; he is entirely absent from the film in which Hikari is the sole main antagonist. Additionally, Jack and Charlie face two more enemies present only in the series, a pair of non-asian fighters who are even more powerful than Hikari's hitmen, after defeating them, then they face their final enemy, the previously mentioned main antagonist whom they have to kill to finally avenge William Chung and save Shanghai for good.\n\nDue to the series' episodic nature, the characters are more developed and their backgrounds and motivations explored in much more detail than in the theatrical version. In the series, Jack and Charlie are portrayed to some extent, less ideally as in the film and more as flawed, ordinary human beings: Jack even abandons Charlie during a bloody battle fearing for his life and Charlie harbors a deep xenophobic grudge against Susan, going as far as to hit her and try to murder her. Conversely, the series also explores Jack and Charlie's positive aspects, such as their loyalty to their Mafia brothers and their deep bond and friendship. The series also does so with some of the antagonists, such as the japanese ninja assassin Mimo, whom despite being ruthless and cold-blooded, is capable of acknowledging his enemies' courage after murdering a group of young men from ''The Organization'' and call them \"chinese brave men\". \n\nNarratively, the film is an abridged version of the series, although some events in it are entirely absent in the film due to the condensing of the story. In the series and in the film, Jack and Charlie's struggles against the japanese syndicate puts them in dire situations, although in the series, the odds they face are even greater; when they battle each one of the assassins, they suffer utter defeat several times. In the series, they face Mr. Jones and Mimo two times, suffering humiliating defeats the first time they battle agains each one of them; in the film they fight them to the death only once, these battle sequences in the series are longer, in the film, they are shortened and new sequences were created for these events through reshoots. The battle sequences against Fuji the swordsman and Mimo the Ninja are identical in both the series and the theatrical version, although slightly shorter in the latter.\n\n==Notes==\n* The film uses several poorly made special effects, where wiring and other equipment is clearly visible, which along with the generally poor acting and editing leaves quite a comedic result.\n* Dave Kelly, aka \"Shmorky\", of [[Something Awful]] fame exploited the also comical over-the-top fighting sound effects and poor English overdubbing of the film for use in one of his Flash Tubs, [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/flash-tub/ninja-vs-peasant.php \"Ninja Vs.
