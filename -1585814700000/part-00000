Such social groups function as protective [[clique]]s within the physical groups in which the primates live. The number of social group members a primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex.

Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate [[genera]], Dunbar predicted a human \"mean group size\" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).<ref name=\"dunbar92\"/>\n\nDunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans.  Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], Dunbar searched the [[anthropological]] and [[ethnographical]] literature for census-like group size information for various [[hunter\u2013gatherer]] societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories\u2014small, medium and large, equivalent to [[Band society|bands]], [[Kinship|cultural lineage groups]] and [[tribe]]s\u2014with respective size ranges of 30\u201350, 100\u2013200 and 500\u20132500 members each.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a [[Neolithic]] farming village; 150 as the splitting point of [[Hutterite]] settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional [[army|armies]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]] and in [[modern world|modern times]] since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate [[Company (military unit)|company]] size.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} such as [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] villages, [[nomad]]ic tribes, and historical [[war|military]] groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: \"[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.\" Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity\u2014due to intense environmental and economic pressures.\n\nDunbar, in ''[[Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language]]'', proposes furthermore that [[language]] may have arisen as a \"cheap\" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social intimacy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |title=Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36336-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674363366 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{ citation | first1 = Robin | last1 =  Dunbar | date = 2004 | journal = Review of General Psychology | number = 2 | pages = 100\u2013110 | title = Gossip in Evolutionary Perspective | url = http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | volume = 8 | doi =  10.1037/1089-2680.8.2.100 | citeseerx =  10.1.1.530.9865 }}</ref> This result is confirmed by the mathematical formulation of the social brain hypothesis, that showed that it is unlikely that increased brain size would have led to large groups without the kind of complex communication that only language allows.<ref name=\":DavidBarrett1\">{{Cite journal|last = D\u00e1vid-Barrett|first = T.|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

Many primates that eat specialized diets that rely on scarce food have evolved small brains to conserve nutrients and are limited to living in small groups or even alone, and they lower average brain size for solitary or small group primates. Small-brained species of primate that are living in large groups are successfully predicted by diet theory to be the species that eat food that is abundant but not very nutritious. Along with the existence of complex deception in small-brained primates in large groups with the opportunity (both abundant food eaters in their natural environments and originally solitary species that adopted social lifestyles under artificial food abundances), this is cited as evidence against the model of social groups selecting for large brains and/or intelligence.<ref>Alex R.

Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate [[genera]], Dunbar predicted a human \"mean group size\" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).<ref name=\"dunbar92\"/>\n\nDunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans.  Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], Dunbar searched the [[anthropological]] and [[ethnographical]] literature for census-like group size information for various [[hunter\u2013gatherer]] societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories\u2014small, medium and large, equivalent to [[Band society|bands]], [[Kinship|cultural lineage groups]] and [[tribe]]s\u2014with respective size ranges of 30\u201350, 100\u2013200 and 500\u20132500 members each.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a [[Neolithic]] farming village; 150 as the splitting point of [[Hutterite]] settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional [[army|armies]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]] and in [[modern world|modern times]] since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate [[Company (military unit)|company]] size.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} such as [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] villages, [[nomad]]ic tribes, and historical [[war|military]] groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: \"[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.\" Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity\u2014due to intense environmental and economic pressures.\n\nDunbar, in ''[[Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language]]'', proposes furthermore that [[language]] may have arisen as a \"cheap\" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently.

Many primates that eat specialized diets that rely on scarce food have evolved small brains to conserve nutrients and are limited to living in small groups or even alone, and they lower average brain size for solitary or small group primates. Small-brained species of primate that are living in large groups are successfully predicted by diet theory to be the species that eat food that is abundant but not very nutritious. Along with the existence of complex deception in small-brained primates in large groups with the opportunity (both abundant food eaters in their natural environments and originally solitary species that adopted social lifestyles under artificial food abundances), this is cited as evidence against the model of social groups selecting for large brains and/or intelligence.<ref>Alex R.

The company started building company buildings with a limit of 150 employees and only 150 parking spaces. When the parking spaces were filled, the company would build another 150-employee building. Sometimes these buildings would be placed only short distances apart. The company is also known for the [[open allocation]] company structure.\n* The number has been used in the study of [[virtual communities]], especially [[MMORPG]]s, such as ''[[Ultima Online]]'', and [[social network service|social networking]] websites, such as [[Facebook]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13176775 |work=The Economist |title=Primates on Facebook |date=26 February 2009}}</ref> (Dunbar himself did a study on Facebook in 2010<ref name=\"facebook study\">{{cite web| title=Sorry, Facebook friends: Our brains can't keep up| url=https://www.cnet.com/news/sorry-facebook-friends-our-brains-cant-keep-up/| first=Don| last=Reisinger| date=25 January 2010| website=[[CNET]]| access-date=9 April 2018| quote=Dunbar has now decided to shift focus to see whether Facebook has changed the number.}}</ref>) and [[MySpace]].<ref>One example is Christopher Allen, \"[http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation]\".</ref>\n* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] tax authority planned to reorganise its functions in 2007 with a maximum 150 employees per office, referring to Dunbar's research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/7972/20070723/|title=Swedish tax collectors organized by apes|last=|first=|date=2007-07-23|website=The Local \u2013 Sweden's news in English|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816042836/http://www.thelocal.se/7972/20070723/|archive-date=2007-08-16|access-date=}}</ref>\n* In 2007, [[Cracked.com]] editor [[David Wong (writer)|David Wong]] wrote a humour piece titled \"What is the Monkeysphere?\" explaining Dunbar's number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html |title=What is the Monkeysphere? |date=30 September 2007 |access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n* In the 2012 novel ''[[This Book Is Full of Spiders]]'', also by David Wong, the character Marconi explains to David the impact Dunbar's number has on human society.

Baylor Law School is affiliated with [[Baylor University]] and located in [[Waco]], [[Texas]]. The school has been accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] since 1931, and has been a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1938. The program offers training in all facets of law, including theoretical analysis, practical application, legal writing, advocacy, professional responsibility, and negotiation and counseling skills.\n\nEstablished in 1849, Baylor Law School was the first law school in Texas and one of the first west of the Mississippi River.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Baylor Law School at Dusk.JPG|thumb|right|Baylor Law School at dusk.]]\nBaylor originally established the law school in 1849; at that time it was the second law school established west of the Mississippi. Law classes continued until 1883 when the school was discontinued. In 1920, the Board of Trustees reestablished the law school (called the Law Department at that time) under the direction of Dean Allen G. Flowers. The school was temporarily suspended from 1943\u20131946 as a result of World War II. Baylor is also unique in that it allows students and professors to engage in romantic relationships. Bradley J.B. Toben currently serves as Dean of the Law School.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Baylor University School of Law.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Baylor Law School on the banks of the Brazos River.]]\nUnlike the rest of Baylor's programs, the Baylor Law School operates on a [[quarter system]]; a student may begin classes in either February (spring quarter), May (summer quarter), or August (fall quarter). Students that begin classes in the spring quarter receive special treatment and usually enjoy an easier law school experience than students who begin in the summer or fall quarters. The Law School also has four graduating classes per year (coinciding with the end of each quarter including the winter quarter). Each matriculate class has a separate application pool, and applicants are required to apply to the quarter in which they would like to begin (if a student wants to be considered for admission in different quarters a separate application package is required for each). \n\nA typical academic year consists of three quarters, with students choosing to take off the fourth quarter of the year to complete a clerkship or internship. However, students may elect to complete the program in only 27 months by attending every quarter. The school\u2019s curriculum is a practical one, focused more on the positive state of the law than a normative one. \n\n* First-year students are required to take 13 mandatory courses (41 credit hours) with no electives permitted. The required courses are in appellate advocacy and procedure; basic taxation principles for lawyers; civil procedure; contracts (I and II); criminal law; criminal procedure; legal analysis, research and communication (LARC, I and II), legislation, administrative power and procedure (LAPP); property (I and II); and torts (I and II).<ref name=\"baylor.edu\">http://www.baylor.edu/law/cs/index.php?id=76102</ref>\n* The second-year program consists of a mix of mandatory and elective courses. The four mandatory classes (which must be taken in the student's fourth and fifth quarters) are business organization (I), constitutional law, remedies, and trust and estates (I). At this point students can choose to concentrate in one of nine specialized areas of law (administrative practice, business litigation, business transactions, criminal practice, estate planning, general civil litigation, healthcare law, intellectual property, and real estate and natural resources), though a concentration is not required for graduation.<ref name=\"baylor.edu\"/>\n* The third-year program consists primarily of the School's Practice Court Program. Practice Court traces its roots to the original school, and was returned in 1922 shortly after the school was reinstituted.  Though Practice Court is designed primarily for students who will practice law before trial courts; it is mandatory for all students. Practice Court consists of four classes.  The first three classes (Professional Responsibility, Practice Court I: Pre-Trial Practice and Procedure, and Practice Court II: Trial Evidence, Procedure, and Practice) must be taken as a package within a quarter (and students cannot be enrolled in any other courses during that quarter); Practice Court III: Trial and Post-Trial Practice, Procedure, and Evidence must be taken immediately thereafter in the following quarter (and though students may take electives, any elective cannot be in a class scheduled after 2:15&nbsp;pm).<ref name=\"baylor.edu\"/>  The Practice Court program covers not only mock trials but all aspects of the law and procedure process from the filing of a suit to post-verdict motions.<ref>http://www.baylor.edu/law/Advocacy/index.php?id=76233</ref>\n\nIn addition to the standard [[Juris Doctor]] degree, Baylor Law students can obtain a combined JD with either the [[Master of Business Administration]] (both traditional and with an emphasis in healthcare administration), the [[Master of Taxation]], the [[Master of Public Policy and Administration]], or the [[Master of Divinity]] degree.\n\nIn its law specialties rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Baylor Law's trial advocacy program as the second best in the nation.

The first three classes (Professional Responsibility, Practice Court I: Pre-Trial Practice and Procedure, and Practice Court II: Trial Evidence, Procedure, and Practice) must be taken as a package within a quarter (and students cannot be enrolled in any other courses during that quarter); Practice Court III: Trial and Post-Trial Practice, Procedure, and Evidence must be taken immediately thereafter in the following quarter (and though students may take electives, any elective cannot be in a class scheduled after 2:15&nbsp;pm).<ref name=\"baylor.edu\"/>  The Practice Court program covers not only mock trials but all aspects of the law and procedure process from the filing of a suit to post-verdict motions.<ref>http://www.baylor.edu/law/Advocacy/index.php?id=76233</ref>\n\nIn addition to the standard [[Juris Doctor]] degree, Baylor Law students can obtain a combined JD with either the [[Master of Business Administration]] (both traditional and with an emphasis in healthcare administration), the [[Master of Taxation]], the [[Master of Public Policy and Administration]], or the [[Master of Divinity]] degree.\n\nIn its law specialties rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Baylor Law's trial advocacy program as the second best in the nation.

{"title_page": "Compliance gaining", "text_new": "'''Compliance gaining''' is a term used in the [[social sciences]] that encompasses the intentional act of altering another's behavior. Research in this area originated in the field of [[social psychology]], but communication scholars have also provided ample research in compliance gaining. While [[persuasion]] focuses on attitudes and beliefs, compliance gaining focuses on behavior.\n\n==Overview==\nCompliance gaining occurs whenever a person intentionally induces another person to do something that they might have not done otherwise.<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=S.R.|title=Introductions to the special issue on seeking and resisting compliance: the  vitality of compliance-gaining research.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|pages=273\u2013275|doi=10.1080/10510979809368537}}</ref> Compliance gaining and persuasion are related; however, they are not one and the same. Changes in attitudes and beliefs are often the goal in persuasion; compliance gaining seeks to change the behavior of a target. It is not necessary to change a person's attitude or beliefs to gain compliance. For instance, an automobile driver might have positive attitudes towards driving fast. The threat of a speeding ticket from a police officer positioned in a speed trap may gain compliance from the driver. Conversely, persuading someone to change their attitude or belief will not necessarily gain compliance. A doctor might tell a patient that tobacco use poses a serious threat to a smoker's health. The patient may accept this as a fact and view smoking negatively, but might also continue to use tobacco.\n\n==Developments==\nCompliance gaining research has its roots in social psychology, but overlaps with many other disciplines such as communication and sociology.

The latter study identified six different typologies of situations that can influence compliance gaining behaviors: personal benefits (how much personal gain an actor can yield from the influencing behavior), dominance (the power relation between the actor and the target), rights (whether the actor has the right to expect compliance), resistance (how easy will the target be influenced), intimacy (whether the relation between actor and target is shallow), and consequences (what sort of effect this situation would have on the relationship between actor and target). Dillard and Burgoon (1985)<ref name=autogenerated10 /> later investigated the Cody-McLaughlin typologies. They concluded that situational variables, as described by Cody and McLaughlin, did very little to predict compliance gaining strategy selection. As early as 1982, there was already strong criticism about the strength of the relationships between situational variables and compliance gaining message selection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=S|last2=Backus|first2=D|title=Are compliance-gaining strategies dependent on situational  variables?|journal=Central States Speech Journal|date=1982|volume=33|pages=469\u2013479|doi=10.1080/10510978209388453}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, many research efforts attempting to link compliance gaining strategy selection and features of a situation or features of the individual \"failed to coalesce into a coherent body of knowledge\".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal|last1=Schrader|first1=D.C.|last2=Dillard|first2=J.P.|title=Goal structures and interpersonal influence.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|page=134,1,89}}</ref> Situational dimensions and individual differences were not effective in predicting so researchers went into other perspectives in an effort to understand compliance gaining.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> For instance, Schrader and Dillard (1998)<ref name=autogenerated1 /> linked primary and secondary goals to compliance gaining strategy. Using the theoretical framework of Goals-Plans-Actions developed by Dillard in 1980, Schrader and Dillard operate from the assumption that individuals possess and act on multiple goals. In any compliance seeking situation, the actor has primary goals that drive the attempt to influence a target. The primary goal is what the interaction is all about. For instance, if an actor wants a target to stop smoking, this is the primary goal and this is what drives the interaction. However, in the course of pursuing that goal, there are \"secondary\" goals to consider. These are goals that limit the behavior of the actor. If getting a target to stop smoking is the primary goal, then a secondary goal might be to maintain a friendly relationship with the target. Dillard specifies five types of secondary goals that temper the compliance gaining behavior: identity goals (morals and personal standards), interaction goals (impression management), relational resource goals (relationship management), personal resource goals (material concerns of the actor), and arousal management goals (efforts to manage anxiety about the compliance gaining attempt).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDespite the charges of individual differences making very little progress in prediction compliance gaining strategies, some researchers in the 2000s have focused their efforts to rectify this weakness in the research to link individual differences with compliance gaining effectiveness. King (2001),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=P.E.|title=Automatic responses, target resistance, and the adaptation of compliance \u2013 seeking requests|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2001|volume=68|issue=4|pages=386\u2013399|doi=10.1080/03637750128067}}</ref> acknowledging the paucity of robust situational and trait studies linked to compliance gaining, attempted to isolate one situation as a predictor for compliance gaining message selection. King's research suggested that when target of compliance gaining were perceived to be less resistant to influence attempts, the actors used more compliance gaining tactics.

As mentioned above, the field of compliance gaining originated in social psychology, but was adopted by many communication scholars as well.

There is literally centuries' worth of literature available about persuasion. However, changing attitudes and beliefs about a product does not necessarily change behaviors. Purchasing a product is a behavior. Researchers such as Parrish-Sprowl, Carveth, & Senk (1994)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parrish-Sprowl|first1=J|last2=Carveth|first2=R|last3=Senk|first3=M|title=The effect of compliance gaining strategy  choice and communicator style on sales success|journal=Journal of Business Communication|date=1994|volume=31|issue=4|pages=291\u2013310|doi=10.1177/002194369403100404}}</ref> have applied compliance gaining research to effective sales.\n\n==Compliance==\nCompliance gaining was not originally conceived in the field of communication but found its roots in the late 1960s as a result of studies and research by two sociologists, [[Gerald Marwell]] and [[David Schmitt]]. In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt produced some interesting compliance-gaining tactics concerning the act of getting a teenager to study. The tactics, sixteen in all, are as follows.\n\n# '''Promise''': If you comply, I will reward you. For example, you offer to increase Dick's allowance if he studies more.\n# '''Threat''': If you do not comply, I will punish you. For example, you threaten to forbid Dick to use the car if he doesn't start studying more.\n# '''Expertise''' (positive): If you comply, you will be rewarded because of the \"nature of things.\" For example, you tell Dick that if he gets good grades he be able to get into college and get a good job.\n# '''Expertise''' (negative): If you do not comply, you will be punished because of the \"nature of things.\" For example, you tell Dick that if he does not get good grades he will not be able to get into college or get a good job.\n# '''Liking''': Act friendly and helpful to get the person in a \"good frame of mind\" so they comply with the request. For example, you try to be as friendly and pleasant as possible to put Dick in a good mood before asking him to study.\n# '''Pre-giving''': Reward the person before requesting compliance. For example, raise Dick's allowance and tell him you now expect him to study.\n# '''Aversive stimulation''': Continuously punish the person, making cessation contingent on compliance. For example, you tell Dick he may not use the car until he studies more.\n# '''Debt''': You owe me compliance because of past favors. For example, you point out that you have sacrificed and saved to pay for Dick's education and that he owes it to you to get good enough grades to get into a good college.\n# '''Moral appeal''': You are immoral if you do not comply. You tell Dick that it is morally wrong for anyone not to get as good grades as possible and that he should study more.\n# '''Self-feeling''' (positive): You will feel better about yourself if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel proud if he gets himself to study more.\n# '''Self-feeling''' (negative): You will feel worse about yourself if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel ashamed of himself if he gets bad grades.\n# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (positive): A person with \"good\" qualities would comply. For example, you tell Dick that because he is a mature and intelligent person he naturally will want to study more and get good grades.\n# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (negative): Only a person with \"bad\" qualities would not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he should study because only someone very childish does not study.\n# '''Altruism''': I need your compliance very badly, so do it for me. For example, you tell Dick that you really want very badly for him to get into a good college and that you wish he would study more as a personal favor to you.\n# '''Esteem''' (positive): People you value will think better of you if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very proud of him if he gets good grades.\n# '''Esteem''' (negative): People you value will think the worse of you if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very disappointed in him if he gets poor grades.\n\nIn 1967, Marwell and Schmitt conducted [[Experiment|experimental research]], using the sixteen compliance gaining tactics and identified five basic compliance-gaining strategies: Rewarding activity, Punishing activity, Expertise, Activation of impersonal commitments, and Activation of personal commitments.\n\n===Power===\nAnother element of compliance-gaining was produced in the early 1960s, as French and Raven were researching the concepts of power, legitimacy, and politeness. They identified five influential aspects associated with power, which help illustrate elements of the study of compliance. The fives [[Power (sociology)|bases of power]] are as follows:\n\n# '''Reward Power''': A person with reward power has control over some valued resource (e.g., promotions and raises).\n# '''Coercive Power''': A person with coercive power has the ability to inflict punishments (e.g., fire you).\n# '''Expert Power''': Expert power is based on what a person knows (e.g., you may do what a doctor tells you to do because they know more about medicine than you do).\n# '''Legitimate Power''': Legitimate power is based on formal rank or position (e.g., you obey someone's commands because they are the vice president in the company for which you work).\n# '''Referent Power''': People have referent power when the person they are trying to influence wants to be like them (e.g., a mentor often has this type of power).\n\n(French & Raven, 1960)\n\n==Techniques==\nThe study of compliance gaining has been central in the development of many commonly used or heard of techniques. The following techniques are a few of what has evolved as a product of the study of compliance gaining strategies. Note, many of these techniques have been empirically documented increasing compliance.\n\n=== Foot-in-the-door (FITD) ===\n{{Main article|Foot-in-the-door technique}}\nWith research starting in 1966 by Freedman & Fraser, foot-in-the door is one of the earliest and most researched compliance gaining techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The \"Just-One-More\"  Technique of Gaining Compliance|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163\u2013170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}</ref> This technique gains compliance by making a smaller easy  request then a larger more difficult request at a later time. The smaller request is usually one that would be widely accepted without scrutiny. The larger request is usually the actual the task or goal wanted to be completed.\n\n==== Effectivity ====\nFreedman and Fraser thought that after satisfying the smaller initial request, if the person was not forced to do then they must be \"the type of person who fulfills such requests\".<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=D|title=The Nature of the First Small Request as a Decisive Factor in the  Effectiveness of the Foot-in-the-Door Technique|journal=Applied Psychology|date=2011|pages=437\u2013453}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller task/request should relate to the larger request and not be trivial. For the foot-in-the-door technique to be successful it must generate the self-aware \"I am the kind of person who fulfills this type of request\" other wise known as the [[self-perception theory]].<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Other studies found that if the initial request is easy but unusual or bizarre, it would also generate the foot-in-the-door effectiveness.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> This idea was developed further into the Disrupt-Then-Reframe technique.\n\nThere are other reasons besides the self-perception theory that makes the foot-in-the-door technique successful.\n\n'''Consistency''' \u2013 Cialdini and Guadagno, Asher, and Demaine believe that what makes people want to fulfill larger request is the need to be consistent.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n'''The Norm to Help Others''' \u2013 Harris believed that after the first request, the norm to help others becomes clear. It only becomes evident after the person reviews his or her reason why they completed the original request.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n'''Satisfying the First Request''' \u2013 Crano and Sivacek thought what made the technique so effective was personal satisfaction. \"The person learns that the fulfillment of request brings the reward of a positive experience. One may assume that the likelihood that satisfaction of this type appears willi increase if the person has to react to something unusual that awakens his or her mindfulness, and will decrease in situations in which the person reacts automatically and habitually\".<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n=== Door-in-the-face (DITF) ===\n{{Main article|Door-in-the-face technique}}\nDoor-in-the-face was first introduced in 1975 by Cialdini and colleagues. The opposite of foot-in-the-door, in the door-in-the-face technique, the requestor asks a large objectionable request which is denied by the target instead of gaining compliance by asking a smaller easy request. The requestor seeking compliance ask a smaller more reasonable request.<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite journal|last1=Feeley|first1=T|last2=Anker|first2=A|last3=Aloe|first3=A|title=The Door-in-the-Face Persuasive Message Strategy: A  Meta-Analysis of the First 35 Years|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2012|volume=79|issue=3|pages=316\u2013343|doi=10.1080/03637751.2012.697631}}</ref>\n\nThere are several theories that explain why door-in-the-face is an effective gaining compliance technique.\n\n'''Self-presentation theory''' \u2013 \"that individuals will comply with a second request due to fears one will be perceived negatively by rejecting successive prosocial request for compliance\".<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n'''Reciprocal concessions''' \u2013 this theory describes the effects of door-in-the-face as a \"process of mutual concessions\". \"The second request represents a concession on the part of the sender (from his or her initial request), and compliance to the second request represents a concession on the part of the receiver (from his or her inclination to not comply with the first request)\".<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n'''Guilt''' \u2013 One reason that makes door-in-the-face such an effective technique is people feel guilty for refusing to comply with a request twice.<ref>(Carpenter, p 163)</ref>\n\n'''Social Responsibility''' \u2013 this theory describes the social repercussions and pressures that occur if an individual declines a request.\n\nAll together the theories propose that a target who declines the first request feel a \"personal or social responsibility\" to comply with the second request. In an effort to avoid feeling guilty or reduce the sense of obligation the target would have.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n== Recent techniques ==\n\n=== Disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) ===\nDTR was first introduced by Barbara Price Davis and Eric S. Knowles in 1999. This technique states that a person will be more likely to comply with a request if the initial request or pitch is confusing. The pitch is immediately followed by a reframing or a reason to comply with the request.<ref name=autogenerated9>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|last2=Boster|first2=F|title=A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Disrupt-Then- Reframe Compliance Gaining Technique|journal=Communication Reports|date=2009|volume=22|issue=2|pages=55\u201362|doi=10.1080/08934210903092590}}</ref>\n\nAn example of this technique is: A waiter states that \"the steak dinner is on special for 800 pennies; it's a really good deal\". Disrupting the couple by saying \"800 pennies\" instead of \"8 dollars\", the waiter is able to increase the likelihood that they will buy the steak dinner.\n\nDTR was found to be a very effective way to gain compliance in non-profit instances such as raising money for charities or asking people to take a survey.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> DTR was found to be less successful as a sales technique; this may be because the message is more scrutinized, making it harder to confuse the target.<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n=== Persistence ===\nPersistence used as a compliance gaining technique, gets the target to comply by repeating the message. In 1979, Cacioppo and Petty found that repeating the message more than five times lead to decrease in compliance.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J.|last2=Shaw|first2=A.S|last3=Hughes|first3=M|last4=Kotowski|first4=M.R.|last5=Strom|first5=R.E.|last6=Deatrick|first6=L.M|title=Dump-and-chase: The effectiveness of persistence as a sequential request compliance-gaining strategy|journal=Communication Studies|date=2009|volume=60|issue=3|pages=219\u2013234|doi=10.1080/10510970902955976}}</ref> Success is enhanced if the repetition comes from more than one person and is enhanced further if the message has the same idea or meaning but is not exact.\n\nAn example of this technique would be: \"My wife kept reminding me to take out the trash until I finally did it.\"\n\n=== Dump and chase (DAC) ===\nPersistence has a high probability of annoying the target and creating a negative interaction which could be viewed as \"nagging\".<ref name=autogenerated7 /> A way to avoid this would be rejecting the targets objection to your request by asking \"why not?\", then forming another message to overcome the second objection to gain compliance. This technique is called dump and chase.\n\nMechanics of this technique are urgency and guilt. When the repeated message is presented to the target it may be perceived as urgent, thus making it seem more important, and more willing to comply. By creating a sense of obligation in the request, the target may develop guilt if not willing to comply.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\n=== Just-One-More (JOM) ===\nJust-One-More was developed as a way to make a donation seem more important. The use of this technique involves using the language of \"Just-One-More\" to gain compliance.<ref>(Carpenter, p. 164)</ref> The technique is found to most useful in instances regarding volunteering and donations. It is seen as \"the last person to help will be more rewarding than being one of the first or those in the middle, due to the expectation that the requestor will appreciate the last person more than any of those who complied previously\".<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The \"Just-One-More\"  Technique of Gaining Compliance.|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163\u2013170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}</ref>\nFor Example: \"Do you want to buy this car? I need just one more sale to reach my quota this month.\"\n\nIf the target finds that the requestor is lying or being deceptive about being the last one, it will create a negative outlook on the person and the organization that he or she represents.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Even though losing some of the effectiveness the requestor could state that they are \"close to their goal\" or \"almost there\".<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n=== 64 compliance gaining strategies ===\nIn \"Classifying Compliance Gaining Messages: Taxonomic Disorder and Strategic Confusion\",<ref name=Kellerman>{{cite journal|last1=Kellermann|first1=K|last2=Cole|first2=T|title=Classifying Compliance Gaining Messages: Taxonomic  Disorder and Strategic Confusion.|journal=Communication Theory|date=1994|pages=3\u201360}}</ref> Kathy Kellermann and Tim Cole put together 64 compliance gaining strategies as an attempt to classify more than 820 previous strategies.<ref name=Kellerman/>\n# '''Actor Takes Responsibility:'''  Try to get others to comply by stating your willingness to help them or even work on the request yourself.  That is, try to gain their compliance by offering to do it yourself as a means of getting them to do what you want. Example: \"Is there anything I can do to so you can finish the project on time?\"\n# '''Altercasting (Negative):'''  Try to get others to comply by pointing out that only a bad person would not do what is wanted.  That is, try to gain their compliance by noting that only a person with negative qualities wouldn't comply. Example: \"You should stop watching these types of television shows as only a disturbed  person would like them.\"  \n# '''Altercasting (Positive):'''  Try to get others to comply by pointing out that a good person would do what is wanted.  That is, try to gain their compliance by noting that any person with positive qualities would comply. Example: \"A good boy would eat all his vegetables.\"\n# '''Altruism:'''  Try to get others to comply by asking them to give you a hand out of the goodness of their heart.  That is, try to gain their compliance by asking them to be altruistic and just do it for you. Example: \"Could you help me move, I would really appreciate it.\"\n# '''Assertion:'''  Try to get others to comply by asserting (forcefully stating) what you want.  That is, try to gain their compliance by demanding (commanding) them to comply. Example: \"Go get a bandaid now!\"\n# '''Audience-Use:'''  Try to get others to comply by having a group of other people present when you make your request.  That is, try to gain their compliance by asking them in front of other people as a way to back up your request. Example: \"I asked her to go to the prom with me in front of her friends.\" \n# '''Authority Appeal:'''  Try to get others to comply on the basis of the authority that you or other people have.  That is, try to gain their compliance by using or relying on a position of power over them to get them do to what you want. Example: \"My boss told me to get him the reports by 10 am so I did.\"\n# '''Aversive Stimulation:'''  Try to get others to comply by doing things they don't like until they agree to comply.  That is, try to gain their compliance by bothering them until they do what you want. Example: \"My co-worker kept bothering me to quit smoking until I finally did.\"\n# '''Bargaining:'''  Try to get others to comply by striking a bargain with them.  That is, try to gain their compliance by negotiating a deal where you each do something for the other so everyone gets what they want. Example: \"If you help me with the dishes, I will help you with the laundry.\"\n# '''Benefit (Other):'''  Try to get others to comply by telling them people other than themselves would benefit if they do what you want.  That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps people other than themselves if they comply. Example: \"By donating to our fundraiser, You ensure that everyone will have a coat this winter.\"\n#'''Benefit (Self):'''  Try to get others to comply by telling them you personally would benefit if they do what you want.  That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps oneself if they comply. Example:  \"If you helped me with the yard work, then I won't get a ticket by the city tomorrow.\"\n#'''Benefit (Target):'''  Try to get others to comply by telling them they personally would benefit if they do what you want.  That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps them if they comply. Example: \"If you go grocery shopping for me tonight then you will have something for lunch tomorrow.\"\n#'''Challenge:'''  Try to get others to comply by challenging them to do what you want.  That is, try to gain their compliance by provoking, stimulating, tempting, goading, and/or galvanizing them to comply. Example: I didn't want to race until his car pulled beside mine and he revved the engine. \n#'''Compliment:'''  Try to get others to comply by complimenting them on their abilities or accomplishments.  That is, try to gain their compliance by praising them to get them to do what you want. Example: With that jump shot, you would be really good at basketball. \n#'''Compromise''':  Try to get others to comply by offering to compromise with them.  That is, try to gain their compliance by making a concession to them so they'll make their concession to you and do what you want. Example: \"I will drop you off at the airport if you will go to the dentist with me.\"\n# '''Cooperation:'''  Try to get others to comply by being cooperative and collaborating with them.  That is, try to gain their compliance not by telling the other person what to do but by offering to discuss things and work them out together. Example: \"We should get the team together and brainstorm new ideas for this problem.\"\n#'''Criticize:'''  Try to get others to comply by criticizing them.  That is, try to gain their compliance by attacking them on a personal level to get them to do what you want. Example: \"It looks like you're really gaining some weight, why don't you go on a run with me.\"\n#'''Debasement:'''  Try to get others to comply by acting pitiful and pleading.  That is, try to gain their compliance by debasing, demeaning, degrading, devaluing, humiliating, and/or lowering yourself so as to deprive yourself of esteem or self-worth to get them to do what you want. Example: \"I am so stupid, I can't believe I deleted the report. Can you please go delay the presentation.\" \n#'''Debt:'''  Try to get others to comply by reminding them they are in debt to you because of things you have done for them in the past.  That is, try to gain their compliance by indicating that they owe it to you to do what you want. Example: \"You should paid for my lunch, I bought your lunch last time.\"\n#'''Deceit:'''  Try to get others to comply by misleading them.  That is, try to gain their compliance by lying to or deceiving them. Example: \"We told them the car was in perfect working order, but the transmission is about to go out.\"\n#'''Direct Request:'''  Try to get others to comply by just making a direct request.  That is, try to gain their compliance by simply asking or stating what you want without giving any reasons for them to comply. Example: \"Can I use the computer?\"\n#'''Disclaimer (Norms/Rules):'''  Try to get others to comply by downplaying or disavowing restrictions and constraints that might prevent them from doing what you want them to do.  That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out that otherwise applicable procedures, rules, norms, and/or expectations should be broken in this instance. Example: \"You should drive faster than the speed limit, this is an emergency!\"\n#'''Disclaimer (Other):'''  Try to get others to comply by downplaying or disavowing the ability of anyone else to do so.  That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out that other people can't help you or do what is needed. Example: \"I would ask Ted for his help but we know that he is not good at presentations.\"\n#'''Disclaimer (Self):'''  Try to get others to comply by downplaying or disavowing your reasons for asking.

Research in this area originated in the field of [[social psychology]], but communication scholars have also provided ample research in compliance gaining. While [[persuasion]] focuses on attitudes and beliefs, compliance gaining focuses on behavior.\n\n==Overview==\nCompliance gaining occurs whenever a person intentionally induces another person to do something that they might have not done otherwise.<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=S.R.|title=Introductions to the special issue on seeking and resisting compliance: the  vitality of compliance-gaining research.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|pages=273\u2013275|doi=10.1080/10510979809368537}}</ref> Compliance gaining and persuasion are related; however, they are not one and the same. Changes in attitudes and beliefs are often the goal in persuasion; compliance gaining seeks to change the behavior of a target. It is not necessary to change a person's attitude or beliefs to gain compliance. For instance, an automobile driver might have positive attitudes towards driving fast. The threat of a speeding ticket from a police officer positioned in a speed trap may gain compliance from the driver. Conversely, persuading someone to change their attitude or belief will not necessarily gain compliance. A doctor might tell a patient that tobacco use poses a serious threat to a smoker's health. The patient may accept this as a fact and view smoking negatively, but might also continue to use tobacco.\n\n==Developments==\nCompliance gaining research has its roots in social psychology, but overlaps with many other disciplines such as communication and sociology. Compliance gaining can occur via mediated channels, but the research is most associated with interpersonal communication.<ref name=autogenerated6 />  In 1967,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marwell|first1=G|last2=Schmitt|first2=D|title=Dimensions of compliance-gaining behavior: an empirical  analysis.|journal=Sociometry|volume=30|pages=350\u2013364|doi=10.2307/2786181}}</ref> sociologists Marwell and Schmitt attempted to explain how people select compliance gaining messages.<ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite journal|last1=Dillard|first1=J.P|last2=Burgoon|first2=M|title=Situational influences on the selection of compliance-gaining  messages: two tests of the predictive utility of the Cody-McLaughlin typology.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1985|volume=52|pages=289\u2013304|doi=10.1080/03637758509376113}}</ref> The researchers posited that people have a mental bank of strategies that they draw from when selecting a message.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J|last2=Shaw|first2=A.S|last3=Hughes|first3=M|last4=Kotowski|first4=M.R|last5=Strom|first5=R.E|last6=Deatrick|first6=L.M|title=Dump-and-chase: The effectiveness of persistence as a sequential request compliance-gaining strategy|journal=Communication Studies|date=2009|volume=60|issue=3|pages=219\u2013234|doi=10.1080/10510970902955976}}</ref> Marwell and Schmitt created a typology for compliance gaining techniques: promise, threat, positive expertise, negative expertise, liking, pregiving, aversive stimulation, debt, moral appeal, positive self-feeling, negative self-feeling, positive altercasting, negative altertcasting, altruism, positive esteem, and negative esteem.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marwell|first1=G|last2=Schmitt|first2=D.R|title=Dimensions of compliance-gaining behavior: an empirical  analysis|journal=Sociometry|date=1967|volume=30|pages=350\u2013367|doi=10.2307/2786181}}</ref> This study was the catalyst for more interest in compliance gaining from communication scholars.\n\nMiller, Boster, Roloff, and Seibold (1977)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=G.R.|last2=Boster|first2=F|last3=Roloff|first3=M.E.|last4=Siebold|first4=D|title=Compliance\u2010gaining message  strategies: A typology and some findings concerning effects of situational differences.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1977|volume=44|issue=1|pages=37\u201351|doi=10.1080/03637757709390113}}</ref> as well as Cody and McLaughlin (1980)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cody|first1=M.J.|last2=Mclaughlin|first2=M.L|title=Perceptions of compliance-gaining situations: a  dimensional analysis.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1980|volume=47|issue=2|pages=132\u2013148|doi=10.1080/03637758009376026}}</ref> studied the situational variables that influences compliance gaining strategies. The latter study identified six different typologies of situations that can influence compliance gaining behaviors: personal benefits (how much personal gain an actor can yield from the influencing behavior), dominance (the power relation between the actor and the target), rights (whether the actor has the right to expect compliance), resistance (how easy will the target be influenced), intimacy (whether the relation between actor and target is shallow), and consequences (what sort of effect this situation would have on the relationship between actor and target). Dillard and Burgoon (1985)<ref name=autogenerated10 /> later investigated the Cody-McLaughlin typologies. They concluded that situational variables, as described by Cody and McLaughlin, did very little to predict compliance gaining strategy selection. As early as 1982, there was already strong criticism about the strength of the relationships between situational variables and compliance gaining message selection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=S|last2=Backus|first2=D|title=Are compliance-gaining strategies dependent on situational  variables?|journal=Central States Speech Journal|date=1982|volume=33|pages=469\u2013479|doi=10.1080/10510978209388453}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, many research efforts attempting to link compliance gaining strategy selection and features of a situation or features of the individual \"failed to coalesce into a coherent body of knowledge\".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal|last1=Schrader|first1=D.C.|last2=Dillard|first2=J.P.|title=Goal structures and interpersonal influence.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|page=134,1,89}}</ref> Situational dimensions and individual differences were not effective in predicting so researchers went into other perspectives in an effort to understand compliance gaining.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> For instance, Schrader and Dillard (1998)<ref name=autogenerated1 /> linked primary and secondary goals to compliance gaining strategy. Using the theoretical framework of Goals-Plans-Actions developed by Dillard in 1980, Schrader and Dillard operate from the assumption that individuals possess and act on multiple goals. In any compliance seeking situation, the actor has primary goals that drive the attempt to influence a target. The primary goal is what the interaction is all about. For instance, if an actor wants a target to stop smoking, this is the primary goal and this is what drives the interaction. However, in the course of pursuing that goal, there are \"secondary\" goals to consider. These are goals that limit the behavior of the actor. If getting a target to stop smoking is the primary goal, then a secondary goal might be to maintain a friendly relationship with the target. Dillard specifies five types of secondary goals that temper the compliance gaining behavior: identity goals (morals and personal standards), interaction goals (impression management), relational resource goals (relationship management), personal resource goals (material concerns of the actor), and arousal management goals (efforts to manage anxiety about the compliance gaining attempt).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDespite the charges of individual differences making very little progress in prediction compliance gaining strategies, some researchers in the 2000s have focused their efforts to rectify this weakness in the research to link individual differences with compliance gaining effectiveness. King (2001),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=P.E.|title=Automatic responses, target resistance, and the adaptation of compliance \u2013 seeking requests|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2001|volume=68|issue=4|pages=386\u2013399|doi=10.1080/03637750128067}}</ref> acknowledging the paucity of robust situational and trait studies linked to compliance gaining, attempted to isolate one situation as a predictor for compliance gaining message selection. King's research suggested that when target of compliance gaining were perceived to be less resistant to influence attempts, the actors used more compliance gaining tactics. When targets were perceived as strongly resistant, the actors used less tactics.

There is literally centuries' worth of literature available about persuasion. However, changing attitudes and beliefs about a product does not necessarily change behaviors. Purchasing a product is a behavior. Researchers such as Parrish-Sprowl, Carveth, & Senk (1994)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parrish-Sprowl|first1=J|last2=Carveth|first2=R|last3=Senk|first3=M|title=The effect of compliance gaining strategy  choice and communicator style on sales success|journal=Journal of Business Communication|date=1994|volume=31|issue=4|pages=291\u2013310|doi=10.1177/002194369403100404}}</ref> have applied compliance gaining research to effective sales.\n\n==Compliance==\nCompliance gaining was not originally conceived in the field of communication but found its roots in the late 1960s as a result of studies and research by two sociologists, [[Gerald Marwell]] and [[David Schmitt]]. In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt produced some interesting compliance-gaining tactics concerning the act of getting a teenager to study. The tactics, sixteen in all, are as follows.\n\n# '''Promise''': If you comply, I will reward you. For example, you offer to increase Dick's allowance if he studies more.\n# '''Threat''': If you do not comply, I will punish you. For example, you threaten to forbid Dick to use the car if he doesn't start studying more.\n# '''Expertise''' (positive): If you comply, you will be rewarded because of the \"nature of things.\" For example, you tell Dick that if he gets good grades he be able to get into college and get a good job.\n# '''Expertise''' (negative): If you do not comply, you will be punished because of the \"nature of things.\" For example, you tell Dick that if he does not get good grades he will not be able to get into college or get a good job.\n# '''Liking''': Act friendly and helpful to get the person in a \"good frame of mind\" so they comply with the request. For example, you try to be as friendly and pleasant as possible to put Dick in a good mood before asking him to study.\n# '''Pre-giving''': Reward the person before requesting compliance. For example, raise Dick's allowance and tell him you now expect him to study.\n# '''Aversive stimulation''': Continuously punish the person, making cessation contingent on compliance. For example, you tell Dick he may not use the car until he studies more.\n# '''Debt''': You owe me compliance because of past favors. For example, you point out that you have sacrificed and saved to pay for Dick's education and that he owes it to you to get good enough grades to get into a good college.\n# '''Moral appeal''': You are immoral if you do not comply. You tell Dick that it is morally wrong for anyone not to get as good grades as possible and that he should study more.\n# '''Self-feeling''' (positive): You will feel better about yourself if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel proud if he gets himself to study more.\n# '''Self-feeling''' (negative): You will feel worse about yourself if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel ashamed of himself if he gets bad grades.\n# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (positive): A person with \"good\" qualities would comply. For example, you tell Dick that because he is a mature and intelligent person he naturally will want to study more and get good grades.\n# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (negative): Only a person with \"bad\" qualities would not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he should study because only someone very childish does not study.\n# '''Altruism''': I need your compliance very badly, so do it for me. For example, you tell Dick that you really want very badly for him to get into a good college and that you wish he would study more as a personal favor to you.\n# '''Esteem''' (positive): People you value will think better of you if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very proud of him if he gets good grades.\n# '''Esteem''' (negative): People you value will think the worse of you if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very disappointed in him if he gets poor grades.\n\nIn 1967, Marwell and Schmitt conducted [[Experiment|experimental research]], using the sixteen compliance gaining tactics and identified five basic compliance-gaining strategies: Rewarding activity, Punishing activity, Expertise, Activation of impersonal commitments, and Activation of personal commitments.\n\n===Power===\nAnother element of compliance-gaining was produced in the early 1960s, as French and Raven were researching the concepts of power, legitimacy, and politeness. They identified five influential aspects associated with power, which help illustrate elements of the study of compliance. The fives [[Power (sociology)|bases of power]] are as follows:\n\n# '''Reward Power''': A person with reward power has control over some valued resource (e.g., promotions and raises).\n# '''Coercive Power''': A person with coercive power has the ability to inflict punishments (e.g., fire you).\n# '''Expert Power''': Expert power is based on what a person knows (e.g., you may do what a doctor tells you to do because they know more about medicine than you do).\n# '''Legitimate Power''': Legitimate power is based on formal rank or position (e.g., you obey someone's commands because they are the vice president in the company for which you work).\n# '''Referent Power''': People have referent power when the person they are trying to influence wants to be like them (e.g., a mentor often has this type of power).\n\n(French & Raven, 1960)\n\n==Techniques==\nThe study of compliance gaining has been central in the development of many commonly used or heard of techniques. The following techniques are a few of what has evolved as a product of the study of compliance gaining strategies. Note, many of these techniques have been empirically documented increasing compliance.\n\n=== Foot-in-the-door (FITD) ===\n{{Main article|Foot-in-the-door technique}}\nWith research starting in 1966 by Freedman & Fraser, foot-in-the door is one of the earliest and most researched compliance gaining techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The \"Just-One-More\"  Technique of Gaining Compliance|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163\u2013170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}</ref> This technique gains compliance by making a smaller easy  request then a larger more difficult request at a later time. The smaller request is usually one that would be widely accepted without scrutiny. The larger request is usually the actual the task or goal wanted to be completed.\n\n==== Effectivity ====\nFreedman and Fraser thought that after satisfying the smaller initial request, if the person was not forced to do then they must be \"the type of person who fulfills such requests\".<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=D|title=The Nature of the First Small Request as a Decisive Factor in the  Effectiveness of the Foot-in-the-Door Technique|journal=Applied Psychology|date=2011|pages=437\u2013453}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller task/request should relate to the larger request and not be trivial. For the foot-in-the-door technique to be successful it must generate the self-aware \"I am the kind of person who fulfills this type of request\" other wise known as the [[self-perception theory]].<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Other studies found that if the initial request is easy but unusual or bizarre, it would also generate the foot-in-the-door effectiveness.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> This idea was developed further into the Disrupt-Then-Reframe technique.\n\nThere are other reasons besides the self-perception theory that makes the foot-in-the-door technique successful.\n\n'''Consistency''' \u2013 Cialdini and Guadagno, Asher, and Demaine believe that what makes people want to fulfill larger request is the need to be consistent.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n'''The Norm to Help Others''' \u2013 Harris believed that after the first request, the norm to help others becomes clear. It only becomes evident after the person reviews his or her reason why they completed the original request.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n'''Satisfying the First Request''' \u2013 Crano and Sivacek thought what made the technique so effective was personal satisfaction. \"The person learns that the fulfillment of request brings the reward of a positive experience. One may assume that the likelihood that satisfaction of this type appears willi increase if the person has to react to something unusual that awakens his or her mindfulness, and will decrease in situations in which the person reacts automatically and habitually\".<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n=== Door-in-the-face (DITF) ===\n{{Main article|Door-in-the-face technique}}\nDoor-in-the-face was first introduced in 1975 by Cialdini and colleagues. The opposite of foot-in-the-door, in the door-in-the-face technique, the requestor asks a large objectionable request which is denied by the target instead of gaining compliance by asking a smaller easy request. The requestor seeking compliance ask a smaller more reasonable request.<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite journal|last1=Feeley|first1=T|last2=Anker|first2=A|last3=Aloe|first3=A|title=The Door-in-the-Face Persuasive Message Strategy: A  Meta-Analysis of the First 35 Years|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2012|volume=79|issue=3|pages=316\u2013343|doi=10.1080/03637751.2012.697631}}</ref>\n\nThere are several theories that explain why door-in-the-face is an effective gaining compliance technique.\n\n'''Self-presentation theory''' \u2013 \"that individuals will comply with a second request due to fears one will be perceived negatively by rejecting successive prosocial request for compliance\".<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n'''Reciprocal concessions''' \u2013 this theory describes the effects of door-in-the-face as a \"process of mutual concessions\". \"The second request represents a concession on the part of the sender (from his or her initial request), and compliance to the second request represents a concession on the part of the receiver (from his or her inclination to not comply with the first request)\".<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n'''Guilt''' \u2013 One reason that makes door-in-the-face such an effective technique is people feel guilty for refusing to comply with a request twice.<ref>(Carpenter, p 163)</ref>\n\n'''Social Responsibility''' \u2013 this theory describes the social repercussions and pressures that occur if an individual declines a request.\n\nAll together the theories propose that a target who declines the first request feel a \"personal or social responsibility\" to comply with the second request. In an effort to avoid feeling guilty or reduce the sense of obligation the target would have.<ref name=autogenerated8 />\n\n== Recent techniques ==\n\n=== Disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) ===\nDTR was first introduced by Barbara Price Davis and Eric S. Knowles in 1999. This technique states that a person will be more likely to comply with a request if the initial request or pitch is confusing. The pitch is immediately followed by a reframing or a reason to comply with the request.<ref name=autogenerated9>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|last2=Boster|first2=F|title=A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Disrupt-Then- Reframe Compliance Gaining Technique|journal=Communication Reports|date=2009|volume=22|issue=2|pages=55\u201362|doi=10.1080/08934210903092590}}</ref>\n\nAn example of this technique is: A waiter states that \"the steak dinner is on special for 800 pennies; it's a really good deal\". Disrupting the couple by saying \"800 pennies\" instead of \"8 dollars\", the waiter is able to increase the likelihood that they will buy the steak dinner.\n\nDTR was found to be a very effective way to gain compliance in non-profit instances such as raising money for charities or asking people to take a survey.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> DTR was found to be less successful as a sales technique; this may be because the message is more scrutinized, making it harder to confuse the target.<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n=== Persistence ===\nPersistence used as a compliance gaining technique, gets the target to comply by repeating the message. In 1979, Cacioppo and Petty found that repeating the message more than five times lead to decrease in compliance.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J.|last2=Shaw|first2=A.S|last3=Hughes|first3=M|last4=Kotowski|first4=M.R.|last5=Strom|first5=R.E.|last6=Deatrick|first6=L.M|title=Dump-and-chase: The effectiveness of persistence as a sequential request compliance-gaining strategy|journal=Communication Studies|date=2009|volume=60|issue=3|pages=219\u2013234|doi=10.1080/10510970902955976}}</ref> Success is enhanced if the repetition comes from more than one person and is enhanced further if the message has the same idea or meaning but is not exact.\n\nAn example of this technique would be: \"My wife kept reminding me to take out the trash until I finally did it.\"\n\n=== Dump and chase (DAC) ===\nPersistence has a high probability of annoying the target and creating a negative interaction which could be viewed as \"nagging\".<ref name=autogenerated7 /> A way to avoid this would be rejecting the targets objection to your request by asking \"why not?\", then forming another message to overcome the second objection to gain compliance. This technique is called dump and chase.\n\nMechanics of this technique are urgency and guilt. When the repeated message is presented to the target it may be perceived as urgent, thus making it seem more important, and more willing to comply. By creating a sense of obligation in the request, the target may develop guilt if not willing to comply.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\n=== Just-One-More (JOM) ===\nJust-One-More was developed as a way to make a donation seem more important. The use of this technique involves using the language of \"Just-One-More\" to gain compliance.<ref>(Carpenter, p. 164)</ref> The technique is found to most useful in instances regarding volunteering and donations. It is seen as \"the last person to help will be more rewarding than being one of the first or those in the middle, due to the expectation that the requestor will appreciate the last person more than any of those who complied previously\".<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The \"Just-One-More\"  Technique of Gaining Compliance.|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163\u2013170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}</ref>\nFor Example: \"Do you want to buy this car? I need just one more sale to reach my quota this month.\"\n\nIf the target finds that the requestor is lying or being deceptive about being the last one, it will create a negative outlook on the person and the organization that he or she represents.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Even though losing some of the effectiveness the requestor could state that they are \"close to their goal\" or \"almost there\".<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n=== 64 compliance gaining strategies ===\nIn \"Classifying Compliance Gaining Messages: Taxonomic Disorder and Strategic Confusion\",<ref name=Kellerman>{{cite journal|last1=Kellermann|first1=K|last2=Cole|first2=T|title=Classifying Compliance Gaining Messages: Taxonomic  Disorder and Strategic Confusion.|journal=Communication Theory|date=1994|pages=3\u201360}}</ref> Kathy Kellermann and Tim Cole put together 64 compliance gaining strategies as an attempt to classify more than 820 previous strategies.<ref name=Kellerman/>\n# '''Actor Takes Responsibility:'''  Try to get others to comply by stating your willingness to help them or even work on the request yourself.
