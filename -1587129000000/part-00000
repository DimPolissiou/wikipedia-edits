About 1898-1900 his family fell on hard times and moved to [[Donetsk]], where his father found work as a coachman. Zadov graduated at a Jewish [[heder|elementary school]] there and started to work as a manual laborer at a mill, later working at Yuzovka Metallurgical Works.\n\n==Anarchist underground and penal labour==\nLev Zadov joined the Yuzovka Metallurgical Works [[Anarchism|anarchist]] group before 1912, and was a long-time member of the Yuzovsk ([[Donetsk]]) Group of Anarcho-Communists. He participated in several armed robberies, as was not uncommon for anarchist groups at the time for financing their activities. Groups engaging in these sorts of behavior were termed as \"bezmotivniks\", from \"bezmotivny\" - \"motiveless terror\". During his period of activity there, he robbed, among others, an artel official at a mine and a cash office in [[Debaltseve]].

He was elected a member of the city [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] in Yuzovka soon after that<ref name=\"VA\"/>. Zadov had been instrumental in organizing the anarchist paramilitary force in Donetsk and joined the [[Red Army]] in Spring 1918 with this group. His junior brother Daniel had been member of the force too. Zadov quickly rose through the ranks and became deputy regiment commander. Zadov's regiment fought advancing German Army and [[Tsentralna Rada]] troops, but was defeated and withdrew toward [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]]. The Zadov brothers defected from the Red Army there and returned to the Ukraine to join the anarchists.\n\n==Time as a Makhnovist==\nIn the late autumn of 1918, Zadov returned to Ukraine and  joined [[Nestor Makhno]]'s [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in August 1918 and quickly became chief of the Kontrrazvedska, the military intelligence of [[the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]<ref name=\"VA\">{{cite book |last= Azarov|first= Vyacheslav|date= October 2007|title= Kontrrazvedka - The Story of the Makhnovist Intelligence Service|url= https://libcom.org/files/Kontrrazvedka%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20the%20Makhnovist%20Intelligence%20Service%20-%20V.%20Azarov.pdf|publisher= Black Cat Press|isbn= 978-0-9737827-2-1}}</ref>. According to numerous eyewitnesses, he was a member of Makhno's inner circle and friend of Makhno's wife. Zadov is credited with personally saving Makhno's life several times during skirmishes with Red Army forces. \n\nIn November 1918 he participated in the formation of detachments in the villages of [[Donetsk]], [[Grishinsky]] and [[Mariupol]]. In early March 1919, Zadov participated in the assault on Mariupol. Here and in [[Berdyansk]], he created the so-called \"Civilian departments\" of counterintelligence - engaged in supplying the army. In the summer of 1919, counterintelligence was divided into army and corps, and Zadov became head of counterintelligence of the 1st Donetsk corps. In December 1919, the intelligence of the Donetsk Corps led by him sent a group of four scouts to the [[Kherson]]-[[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] region, who obtained important information about the mood of the population, the deployment of enemy troops, and the composition of the security forces of [[Denikin]]. Then he led the execution of the Bolshevik commander Mikhail Polonsky, who was suspected of conspiring against Makhno.\n\nIn 1919, after the defeat of Denikin, the [[Red Army]] returned to Ukraine, marching along the path cleared by the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]], and in January 1920 Makhno was outlawed. Lev and his brother Daniel were among those who saved Makhno, who had contracted typhoid fever, by hiding him in a secluded place, while they themselves went to visit relatives in [[Donbass]]. In the spring of 1920, the Zadov brothers returned to Makhno in his restored army. \n\nIn October 1920, the [[Starobelsk]] Soviet-Makhnovist agreement was signed, in order for the Bolsheviks to use the rebels in the fight against [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in [[Crimea]]. Zadov was appointed commandant of the Crimean Corps, he participated in the assault on [[Perekop]] and the defeat of Wrangel. After the victory in Crimea, Zadov and the remnants of the Crimean corps made their way to the rest of the Makhnovists in December 1920. Having suffered heavy losses, Makhno, at the head of a small detachment, made his last raid in Ukraine in July-August 1921. On August 28, 1921, Zadov organized the escape of remnants of Makhnovist guerrilla forces to [[Romania]]. \n\n==OGPU operative==\nIn August 1921, disarming the outfit of border guards, Lev Zadov ensured the transfer to Romania of a group of 77 people \u2014 all that remained of the rebel army. The period of forced emigration began, lasting about three years. The Zadov brothers lived in [[Bucharest]], working seasonal jobs. In 1924, Romanian intelligence (\u201cSiguranza\u201d) offered Zinkovsky cooperation and participation in a sabotage group in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The Soviet Chekist [[Dmitry Medvedev (partisan)|Dmitry Medvedev]] wrote in his memoirs that these agreements with the Romanians were fictitious from the very beginning. Nestor Makhno and Zadov decided to take advantage of the offer so that Lev Zadov and his comrades could get treasure buried in the [[Dibrovsky forest]] on a rainy day. \n\nIn 1924, the saboteurs crossed the border along the prepared corridor. Immediately after crossing the border, Leo made a statement: \u201cBoys, well, to hell with this terror. Let's go give up.\u201d After interrogations and clarifications, everyone except Lev Zadov was released from custody, banning his departure from [[Kharkov]] until the circumstances were fully clarified. Having lost hope of a successful outcome, at one of the interrogations conducted by the Chekist [[Mark Spektor]], Zadov asked: if he would be threatened with execution, then [[Mark Borisovich]] should bring a bottle of vodka. After six months of interrogation, Zadov\u2019s fate was decided in his favor. The Cheka authorities decided to use his experience in intelligence and counterintelligence, as well as his great authority among the Makhnovists, to involve him in illegal work in the Soviet state security agencies. And besides, at that time, an amnesty from 1922 for the former Makhnovists already extended to him. Lev Zadov joined the [[KGB|OGPU]], working in their office in [[Odessa]] and Daniel Zadov became an OGPU operative in [[Tiraspol]]. Zadov was instrumental in the annihilation of several anti-Soviet militant groups. In 1929, Zinkovsky received gratitude from the GPU of the Ukrainian SSR and 200 rubles for the assassination of a saboteur (Zinkovsky himself was wounded in the arm during the operation).\n\n{{quote|\u201c... Once, in an ambush, Lev saw a silhouette of a man slowly moving between the trees. Having let the saboteur down by 5-6 meters, Zadov loudly demanded: \u201cDrop your weapon!\u201d. In response, a shot rang out at the same instant. A sharp pain burned his hand. Without moving or changing intonation, in response to a point-blank shot, Lev Zadov repeated: \u201cDrop your weapon!\u201d - and went to the bandit. The seasoned killer flinched and raised his hands. Subsequently, during interrogation, the detainee said that if a group had attacked him, he would have fled from them as he had fled several times: \u201cAnd here, I shot at point blank range, and he stood and calmly offered to hand over the weapon. I don\u2019t remember why I raised my hands,\u201c- the bandit said during the interrogation ...\u201d}}\n\nHe is credited with running one of the most successful Soviet intelligence operations against Romania, and in 1932, he received a registered military weapon from the Odessa Regional Executive Committee for the \"successful fight against counter-revolution\". In 1934 he received a monetary reward and registered military weapons for the elimination of a group of terrorists.\n\n===Death===\nOn August 26, 1937, the Zadov brothers were both arrested during the [[Great Purge]] and accused of collaboration with Romanian security services. The Zadov brothers' trial took place on September 25, 1938 and lasted only 15 minutes. The court found them guilty on all counts, including \"collaboration with foreign secret services\" and serving with Nestor Makhno, and sentenced them to death. Both Lev and Daniel were executed by firing squad on September 25, 1938. Zadov\u2019s cellmate was [[Konstantin Shteppa]], who left his detailed description <ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=page&num=6173|chapter=12.

In January 1990, Lev Zadov was rehabilitated.\n\n==Personal life==\nLev Zadov married Vera Matvienko in 1925 and had a daughter, Alla Zinkovskaya (born 1921), and son, Vadim Zinkovsky (born 1926). Alla Zinkovskaya volunteered to join Red Army in the beginning of the [[Soviet-German War]].

Vadim joined the Red Army in 1944 (age 18) and became a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Vadim Zinkovsky retired from the [[Soviet Army]] as a [[colonel]] in 1977.\n\n==Cultural depiction==\nLev Zadov is depicted in [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]]'s \"The Road to Calvary\" novels as a ruthless but cowardly killer, who participates in numerous atrocities against civilians but shies away from battle engagements. The phrases \"Hide your teeth or I'll swing them out\" and \"I'm Leva Zadov, I'll speak and you'll fear\" attributed to him by Tolstoy, became part of Russian [[slang]]. It is proven today that Tolstoy used a pamphlet published in 1924 in [[Kiev]] for his information on Zadov.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hrono.info/biograf/bio_z/zadov.html \u0417\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439-\u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447] (Russian)\n* [http://www.makhno.ru/other/20.php \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u042f\u0440\u0443\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u041a\u0442\u043e, \u043e\u043d \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432?] (Russian)\n* [http://www.makhno.ru/other/21.php \u0421\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \"\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0443\"] (Russian)\n\n{{Anarchism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zadov, Lev}}\n[[Category:1893 births]]\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century executions for treason]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:NKVD officers]]\n[[Category:Makhnovism]]\n[[Category:People of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:People of the Russian Revolution]]\n[[Category:Anarchist partisans]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian Jews]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian Jews]]\n[[Category:Soviet Jews]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian anarchists]]\n[[Category:People executed for treason against the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Great Purge victims from Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Jews executed by the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet anarchists]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2012}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| native_name       = \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n| native_name_lang  = rus\n| image         = Lev-Zadov.jpg\n| image_size    = \n| alt           = \n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|1893|4|11}}\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1938|9|25|1893|4|11}}\n| birth_place   = Veselaya Yevreyka, [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]]\n| death_place   = [[Kiev]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]\n| placeofburial = [[Darnytsia]], Kiev, [[Ukraine]]\n| placeofburial_label = \n| placeofburial_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|display=inline,title}} -->\n| nickname      = Leva, Levka the bandit\n| allegiance    = {{flagicon image|Flag of Russian SFSR (1918-1937).svg}} [[Red Army]] <small>(1918)</small><br />{{flagicon image|Black flag.svg}} [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] <small>(1918-1921)</small><br />{{flagicon image|Flag of the Soviet Union.svg}} [[Soviet Union]] <small>(1924-1938)</small>\n| branch        = Black Army military intelligence <small>(1918-1921)</small><br>[[OGPU]] <small>(1924-1934)</small>\n| serviceyears  = 1918-1938\n| rank          = \n| servicenumber = \n| unit          = \n| commands      = \n| battles       = \n| battles_label = \n| awards        = \n| relations     = \n| laterwork     = \n| signature     = \n| website       = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n}}\n'''Lev Nikolaevich Zadov (Zinkovsky)''', ({{lang-ru|\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (\"\u041b\u0451\u0432\u043a\u0430\") \u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 (\u0417\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)}}) April 11, 1893, Veselaya - September 25, 1938, [[Kiev]] was chief of military intelligence of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and later an [[OGPU]] operative.

In the spring of 1920, the Zadov brothers returned to Makhno in his restored army. \n\nIn October 1920, the [[Starobelsk]] Soviet-Makhnovist agreement was signed, in order for the Bolsheviks to use the rebels in the fight against [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in [[Crimea]]. Zadov was appointed commandant of the Crimean Corps, he participated in the assault on [[Perekop]] and the defeat of Wrangel. After the victory in Crimea, Zadov and the remnants of the Crimean corps made their way to the rest of the Makhnovists in December 1920. Having suffered heavy losses, Makhno, at the head of a small detachment, made his last raid in Ukraine in July-August 1921. On August 28, 1921, Zadov organized the escape of remnants of Makhnovist guerrilla forces to [[Romania]]. \n\n==OGPU operative==\nIn August 1921, disarming the outfit of border guards, Lev Zadov ensured the transfer to Romania of a group of 77 people \u2014 all that remained of the rebel army. The period of forced emigration began, lasting about three years. The Zadov brothers lived in [[Bucharest]], working seasonal jobs. In 1924, Romanian intelligence (\u201cSiguranza\u201d) offered Zinkovsky cooperation and participation in a sabotage group in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The Soviet Chekist [[Dmitry Medvedev (partisan)|Dmitry Medvedev]] wrote in his memoirs that these agreements with the Romanians were fictitious from the very beginning. Nestor Makhno and Zadov decided to take advantage of the offer so that Lev Zadov and his comrades could get treasure buried in the [[Dibrovsky forest]] on a rainy day. \n\nIn 1924, the saboteurs crossed the border along the prepared corridor. Immediately after crossing the border, Leo made a statement: \u201cBoys, well, to hell with this terror. Let's go give up.\u201d After interrogations and clarifications, everyone except Lev Zadov was released from custody, banning his departure from [[Kharkov]] until the circumstances were fully clarified. Having lost hope of a successful outcome, at one of the interrogations conducted by the Chekist [[Mark Spektor]], Zadov asked: if he would be threatened with execution, then [[Mark Borisovich]] should bring a bottle of vodka. After six months of interrogation, Zadov\u2019s fate was decided in his favor. The Cheka authorities decided to use his experience in intelligence and counterintelligence, as well as his great authority among the Makhnovists, to involve him in illegal work in the Soviet state security agencies. And besides, at that time, an amnesty from 1922 for the former Makhnovists already extended to him. Lev Zadov joined the [[KGB|OGPU]], working in their office in [[Odessa]] and Daniel Zadov became an OGPU operative in [[Tiraspol]]. Zadov was instrumental in the annihilation of several anti-Soviet militant groups. In 1929, Zinkovsky received gratitude from the GPU of the Ukrainian SSR and 200 rubles for the assassination of a saboteur (Zinkovsky himself was wounded in the arm during the operation).\n\n{{quote|\u201c... Once, in an ambush, Lev saw a silhouette of a man slowly moving between the trees. Having let the saboteur down by 5-6 meters, Zadov loudly demanded: \u201cDrop your weapon!\u201d. In response, a shot rang out at the same instant. A sharp pain burned his hand. Without moving or changing intonation, in response to a point-blank shot, Lev Zadov repeated: \u201cDrop your weapon!\u201d - and went to the bandit. The seasoned killer flinched and raised his hands. Subsequently, during interrogation, the detainee said that if a group had attacked him, he would have fled from them as he had fled several times: \u201cAnd here, I shot at point blank range, and he stood and calmly offered to hand over the weapon. I don\u2019t remember why I raised my hands,\u201c- the bandit said during the interrogation ...\u201d}}\n\nHe is credited with running one of the most successful Soviet intelligence operations against Romania, and in 1932, he received a registered military weapon from the Odessa Regional Executive Committee for the \"successful fight against counter-revolution\". In 1934 he received a monetary reward and registered military weapons for the elimination of a group of terrorists.\n\n===Death===\nOn August 26, 1937, the Zadov brothers were both arrested during the [[Great Purge]] and accused of collaboration with Romanian security services. The Zadov brothers' trial took place on September 25, 1938 and lasted only 15 minutes. The court found them guilty on all counts, including \"collaboration with foreign secret services\" and serving with Nestor Makhno, and sentenced them to death. Both Lev and Daniel were executed by firing squad on September 25, 1938. Zadov\u2019s cellmate was [[Konstantin Shteppa]], who left his detailed description <ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=page&num=6173|chapter=12.

In January 1990, Lev Zadov was rehabilitated.\n\n==Personal life==\nLev Zadov married Vera Matvienko in 1925 and had a daughter, Alla Zinkovskaya (born 1921), and son, Vadim Zinkovsky (born 1926). Alla Zinkovskaya volunteered to join Red Army in the beginning of the [[Soviet-German War]].

Vadim joined the Red Army in 1944 (age 18) and became a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Vadim Zinkovsky retired from the [[Soviet Army]] as a [[colonel]] in 1977.\n\n==Cultural depiction==\nLev Zadov is depicted in [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]]'s \"The Road to Calvary\" novels as a ruthless but cowardly killer, who participates in numerous atrocities against civilians but shies away from battle engagements. The phrases \"Hide your teeth or I'll swing them out\" and \"I'm Leva Zadov, I'll speak and you'll fear\" attributed to him by Tolstoy, became part of Russian [[slang]]. It is proven today that Tolstoy used a pamphlet published in 1924 in [[Kiev]] for his information on Zadov.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hrono.info/biograf/bio_z/zadov.html \u0417\u0438\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439-\u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447] (Russian)\n* [http://www.makhno.ru/other/20.php \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u042f\u0440\u0443\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u041a\u0442\u043e, \u043e\u043d \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432?] (Russian)\n* [http://www.makhno.ru/other/21.php \u0421\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \"\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0443\"] (Russian)\n\n{{Anarchism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zadov, Lev}}\n[[Category:1893 births]]\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century executions for treason]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:NKVD officers]]\n[[Category:Makhnovism]]\n[[Category:People of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:People of the Russian Revolution]]\n[[Category:Anarchist partisans]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian Jews]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian Jews]]\n[[Category:Soviet Jews]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian anarchists]]\n[[Category:People executed for treason against the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Great Purge victims from Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Jews executed by the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet anarchists]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toNikopol(link changed toNikopol, Ukraine) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Zadov"}

The importance of the place is attributed to the fact that the [[Kurukshetra War]] of the [[Mahabharata]] is said to have taken place here. [[Thaneswar]] whose urban area is merged with Kurukshetra is a pilgrimage site with many locations attributed to Mahabharata.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kurukshetra (India)|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325415/Kurukshetra | accessdate = 9 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not described as a city but a region (\"[[Tirtha (Hinduism)#Kshetra|kshetra]]\" means \"region\" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the central and western parts of the state of Haryana and southern Punjab. According to the [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in [[Sirhind]], Punjab), north of [[Khandava Forest|Khandava]] (Delhi and [[Mewat]] region), east of [[Thar Desert|Maru]] (desert), and west of Parin.<ref>[http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf Agarwal, Vishal: Is There Vedic Evidence for the Indo-Aryan Immigration to India?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528001253/http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/VedicEvidenceforAMT.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Kurukshetra War|label 1 = }}\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A manuscript of [[Mahabharata]] depicting the war at Kurukshetra]]\nAccording to the [[Puranas]], ancient Hindu texts, the region is named after King [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] of the [[Bharata (Mahabharata)#The Bharata race|Bharata]] dynasty, who is also the ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas. These texts also tell that the battle of [[Mahabharata]] was fought on this land.\n\nAs the [[Vamana Purana]] describes, King Kuru chose land at the banks of [[Sarasvati River]] (dried up before 1900 BCE)<ref>''The Lost River'', by Michel Danino. Penguin India 2010</ref> for embedding spirituality with eight virtues:  austerity ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]), truth ([[Satya]]), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness ([[Daya (Hinduism)|Daya]]), purity (Shuddha), charity ([[D\u0101na|Daana]]), devotion ([[Yajna]]), and conduct ([[Brahmacharya]]).

In 1921 the city name was changed to Zaporizhia (Zaporozhye).\n\nThe city's name \"Zaporizhia\" literally means the position of the city located ''beyond the rapids'' (later, in 1932 the rapids were flooded in order to build the [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]]).<ref name=\"Pospelov\" />\n\n==History==\n===Pre foundation history===\n[[File:Skifskaya baba.png|thumb|100px|left|A [[kurgan stelae|Kurgan stele]]<ref>This image of a kurgan stele has been taken in [[Kharkiv]], but one may find similar statues at Khortytsia Island</ref>]]\nArchaeological finds show that about two or three thousand years ago [[Scythians]] lived around the modern city.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Later, [[Khazars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans|Kuman]], [[Tatars]] and [[Slavs]] dwelt there.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] passed through the island of [[Khortytsia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} These territories were called the \"[[Wild Fields]]\", because they were not under the control of any state (it was the land between the highly eroded borders of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]).\n\nIn 1552 [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky]] erected wood-earth fortifications on the small island [[Mala Khortytsia|Little Khortytsia]] which is near the western shore of [[Khortytsia]] island.

In 20th doctrinaire idealistic enthusiasm of the architects was reflected in the intense debate about the habitation of the socialist community. The architects believed that by using new architectural forms they could create a new society. District No. 6 was one of the few implementations of urban development concepts. The construction of the district began in 1929 and finished in 1932. The main idea guiding the architects was the creation of the garden city, the city of the future. Multi-storey houses (not more than 4 floors) with large, roomy apartments were built in Sotsgorod with spacious yards planted with grass and trees around the buildings.\n[[Nikolai Kolli]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062845.html|title=\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0414\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|website=bse.sci-lib.com}}</ref> [[Vesnin brothers|V.A.Vesnin]], [[G.M.Orlov]], [[V.G.Lavrov]] and others designed the DniproHES and SotsGorod.

Lavrov. Families of the Soviet and American engineers, advisors, and industry bosses lived in Sotsgorod at that time.

At the intersection between Sobornyi Avenue and Verkhnya Street, architect I.L. Kosliner set a tower with seven stories. This tower supposedly indicates the entrance gate of Sotsgorod from the south (from Alexandrovsk). Closer to the dam, the second tower was raised (architects I.L. Kosliner and L.Ya. Gershovich). Both towers point out a straight line of the central street of the district.\n\nThe names of the streets have changed several times. The original name of Metallurgist Avenue was Enthusiasts Alley. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This road leads to the factories. At that time, they believed that people going to the plant had only positive feelings like joy, pride, and enthusiasm. At the end of the road stands a 1963 sculpture of the metallurgist by sculptor Ivan Nosenko. During the German occupation, it was named [[Shevchenko]] Avenue.  Later it was renamed Stalin Avenue; and after his death, it got the present name of Metallurgist Avenue.

Initially, it was planned to disassemble it and rebuild it in another location. But expert advice was that this was not cost-effective as it was cheaper to build a new bridge.<ref name=Bridges/>\n\nThe building of the hydroelectric dam meant that a new bridge was required to take the railway over the Dnieper. Instead of having a single bridge, as before, it was decided to take the railway over the island [[Khortytsia]]. The wide part of the river between Khortytsia and the city is known as the New Dnieper, and the narrower part between Khortytsia and the suburbs on the right bank of the river is known as the Old Dnieper.<ref name=Bridges/> The New Dnieper was crossed by a three-arch two-tier bridge. Each of the arches spans 140 m. When the approach spans are included the total length is 715 m weighing 8,480 tons.<ref name=Bridges/> The Old Dnieper was crossed by a single-span arch bridge with a total length of 370 m; the arch spans of 224 m and was then the largest single-span bridge in Europe. This bridge weighed 5,220 tons.<ref name=Bridges/> Both bridges were designed by Professor Streletsky. They were made of riveted steel, and had two tiers: the upper tier for rail traffic and the lower tier for road traffic and pedestrians. They were assembled by a combination of Czechoslovakian and Soviet workers under the direction of a Soviet engineer named Konstantinov. The arches are steel made by the Vitkovetskom steel plant in [[Czechoslovakia]], other steelwork was made at the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant. The new bridges opened on 6 November 1931. The Kichkas Bridge was demolished afterwards.<ref name=Bridges/>\n\n===World War II (1941\u20131945)===\n[[File:ZaporizhiaCombat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Red Army soldier near the Dnieper hydro-electric dam]]\n\n====German occupation====\nThe war ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]) between the USSR and Germany began on 22 June 1941. \n\nAfter the outbreak of the war, the [[Soviet government]] started the evacuation of the industrial equipment from the city to [[Siberia]] .<ref name = zabor.zp.GPW/> The Soviet security forces [[NKVD]] shot political prisoners in the city.<ref>''Germany and the Second World War, Volume IV The Attack on the Soviet Union'', by [[Horst Boog]], [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]], [[Joachim Hoffmann]], [[Ernst Klink]], [[Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller]], [[Gerd R.

The project design is dated and needs revising, and the cost of the bridge is estimated to reach 8 billion hryvnias (as opposed to the original 2 billion).<ref>[https://fakty.ictv.ua/ru/videos/chomu-mosty-buduyut-po-14-rokiv-i-shho-kazhe-ukravtodor \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e 14 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u2013 \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440]</ref>\n\n===Euromaidan events, 2013\u20132014===\nDuring the [[2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations]] protests against President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were also held in Zaporizhia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0be4a86e-86b0-11e3-aa31-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref> On 23 February 2014 Zaporizhia's [[Local government in Ukraine|regional state administration]] building was occupied by 4,500 protesters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/888801-v-zaporoje-uchastniki-maydana-opechatali-kabinetyi-rukovodstva-zaporojskoy-oga.html |title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u044c\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0413\u0410 : \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0423\u041d\u0418\u0410\u041d |agency=Ukrainian Independent Information Agency |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> Mid-April 2014 there were clashes between Ukrainian activists and [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russians]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-04-13/ukraine-s-eastern-tension-turns-deadly-in-worst-case-scenario Ukraine Tensions Escalate as Russia, U.S. Exchange Barbs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915022529/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-04-13/ukraine-s-eastern-tension-turns-deadly-in-worst-case-scenario |date=15 September 2014 }}</ref> The Ukrainian activists outnumbered the pro-Russian protesters.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27012612 Ukraine crisis: What is happening where?], [[BBC News]] (15 April 2014)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-separatists-lay-siege-to-donetsk-oblast-as-ukrainian-government-struggles-to-combat-343288.html?flavour=mobile|title=Armed, pro-Russian separatists lay siege to Donetsk Oblast; at least three dead (VIDEOS, UPDATES) \u2013 Apr. 14, 2014|date=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaming city streets, plants, culture centers (2016)  ===\nIn the year of the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] (1917), the population of Alexandrovsk was about 60,000 people. In the year of the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] (1992), the city's population reached almost 1 million people. In 70 years, a small rural town turned into a large industrial, cultural and scientific center. In other words, the modern city was created in times of socialism and as a result, after 19 May 2016, when the Ukrainian parliament issued Law No. 275, which Ukrainians briefly called as the \"[[Decommunization in Ukraine|Decommunization Law]]\", the city council is forced to rename more than 50 main streets and the names of the administrative parts of the city, the monuments of the Soviet Union leaders ([[Lenin]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]) were destroyed.<ref>[http://zabor.zp.ua/www/content/polnyi-perechen-pereimenovannykh-v-zaporozhe-ulits \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u044c\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446]</ref> The names in honor of the others the Soviet leaders in the titles of the plants, factories, culture centers [[DniproHES]] were also removed.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is located in south-eastern [[Ukraine]].

The [[New Dnieper]] is about 800 m (2600 feet) wide and the Old Dnieper is about 200 m (650 feet). The island has  {{convert|12|x|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} sizes.  There are also several small rivers in the city, which enter the Dnieper: Sukha and [[Mokra Moskovka]], [[Kushuhum River|Kushuhum]], and [[Verkhnia Khortytsia]].\n\nThe flora of Khortytsia island is unique and diverse due to the dry steppe air and a large freshwater basin around, which cleans the polluted by industries air. Khortytsia Island is a national park.  The island surface is cut by large ravines (\"balka\"), hiking routes and historical monuments. The island is a very popular recreational area for both kids and adults. There are a large number of sanatoriums, resorts and health centers.

Well supplied with electricity, Zaporizhia forms, together with the adjoining Donets Basin and the [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] manganese and [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron mines, one of Ukraine's leading industrial complexes.\n\nThe city is also a home of the Ukraine's main automobile production center which is based at the [[ZAZ|Zaporizhia Automobile Factory]] ZAZ producing such Ukrainian car brands like ''Zaporozhets'' and ''Tavria''.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the city became an important industrial center. The presence of cheap labor and the proximity of deposits of coal, iron ore, and manganese created favorable conditions for large-scale enterprises of the iron and mechanical engineering industries. Today Zaporizhia is an important industrial center of the region with heavy industry (particularly [[metallurgy]]), aluminium, and chemical industry. In the city cars, avia motors, radioelectronics are manufactured. The port of Zaporizhia is an important place of transshipment for goods from the [[Donbas]].\n\n[[Zaporizhstal]], Ukraine's fourth largest steel maker, ranks 54th in the world and is based in the city.\n\n===Electricity generation===\nZaporizhia is a large electricity generating hub. There are [[hydroelectric]] [[power plant]] known as \"[[DniproHES]]\" [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] and the largest in Europe nuclear power plant. Zaporizhia plants generate about 25% of the whole Ukrainian electricity consumption. The [[Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant]] is located near the [[Enerhodar]] (trans. Energygifter), around 60&nbsp;km from Zaporizhia which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Also in Enerhodar, is the [[Zaporizhia thermal power station|Zaporizhia Thermal Power Station]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u042f.\u0406. \u041b\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430.jpg|thumb|220px| Magara Academic Drama Theatre]]\nZaporizhia has a [[philharmonic]], few museums, theaters, [[library|libraries]].

The city embraces the island by banks of the New and Old Dnieper streams.\nTwo concrete bridges connect the Island to the city.\nThey have been designed and constructed by the engineer '''Boris N. Preobrazhensky''' in 1952. Two level bridges have height about 54 meters. High level of the bridges is intended for rail and bottom  \u2013 for cars and pedestrians.\n\t\nThe historical and cultural '''museum \"Zaporizhian Sich\"''' is placed on the northern rocky part of the island Khotritsa.\nThe museum is the reconstructed stronghold of the Zaporizhian Cossacks. All features of the military cossack's camp life and their lifestyle are presented in the museum.\n\nThe smaller islands are located between the dam and the island Khortytsia. Each of these islands has its own legend. On one of them named Durnya Scala ('''Rock of the Fool''') [[Tzar]] [[Peter the Great]] punished the Cossacks by flogging for their betrayal on the side of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] during the [[Great Northern War]] between Russia and Sweden.\n\nThe another small island, named Stolb ('''Pillar'''), has a geological feature, which looks like a large bowl in granite slabs, its diameter equals 1,4 \u043c, the depth \u2013 1 \u043c. This bowl is named Cossack's bowl. People say that in summer days under the hot sun, it is easy to boil water in this \"bowl\" and the Cossacks used it for cooking galushki\n(boiled dough in a spicy broth)<ref>[http://www.gis.zp.ua/products/chortitza_1.htm Galina and Maxim Ostapenko, History of our Khortytsia (''\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e'' \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0446\u044b)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831103451/http://www.gis.zp.ua/products/chortitza_1.htm |date=31 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe panoramic view of the DnieproHES from Khortytsia island is very impressive.\nThe straight and long Sobornyi avenue (10&nbsp;km) ends in the '''SotsGorod''' near the Dam, which built up of the constructivist architecture of the 20th century.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe city of Zaporizhia is an important transportation hub in Ukraine and has deeply developed transportation system that includes roadway, rail, river and air options for passenger, freight as well as public utilities transit. Public city transport includes buses, minivans, trams, [[trolleybus]]es and railways.\n\nOn the eastern outskirts of Zaporizhia passes a major national highway M-18 that connects [[Kharkiv]] with [[Simferopol]]. Three other national highways terminate in Zaporizhia, one H-23 which starts in [[Kropyvnytskyi]] and through [[Kryvyi Rih]] ends in Zaporizhia; the second H-08 which starts in [[Kiev]] and travels along Dnieper all the way south passing through number of important cities such as [[Kremenchuk]], [[Kamianske]], [[Dnipro (city)|Dnipro]], and others; and the other highway H-15 which arrives to Zaporizhia from [[Donetsk]].\n\nThere are four road bridges over Dnieper and two rail bridges. All bridges but one connect the city with Khortytsia island. The other bridge goes over the river dam of [[DniproHES]].\n\nThe Zaporizhia city has two railway stations, Zaporizhia-the-First and Zaporizhia-the-Second. The First is the central station. It is located in the southern part of the city and is a part of the \"north-south\" transit route [[Simferopol]]-[[Kharkiv]]. The line of the Zaporizhia-the-Second station connects the [[Donbas]] coalfield with [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron ore site.\n\nThe city's two river ports are part of the national water transportation infrastructure that connects [[Kiev]] to [[Kherson]] along [[Dnieper]] river and utilizes some freight ships as well as [[Cutter (boat)|cutter boats]] to travel between Zaporizhia and nearby villages. The large island of Khortytsia splits the Dnieper into two branches (channels) the main branch that passes the island on its eastern side and the alternative branch also known as ''Staryi Dnipro'' (Old Dnieper) that flows past the island on its western side.\n\nThe [[Zaporizhia International Airport|city's sole airport]] that is located to the east of the city (left-bank of Dnieper) includes both domestic and international flights. To the west of the city (right-bank of Dnieper) is located smaller airfield Shyroke.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[:Category:People from Zaporizhia]]\n\n==In popular culture==\nZaporizhia is an important setting in two [[Axis victory in World War II]] short fictions by [[Harry Turtledove]]: \"[[Ready for the Fatherland]]\" (1991) and \"[[The Phantom Tolbukhin\"]] (1998).

It is also an important industrial centre producing steel, aluminium, aircraft engines, automobiles, transformers for substations, and other heavy industry goods.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{see also|Dnieper Rapids|Zaporizhia (region)}}\nUntil 1921 the city bore the name of Aleksandrovsk after the name of a fortress that was a part of the Dnieper Defence Line of the Russian Empire. In 1921 the city name was changed to Zaporizhia (Zaporozhye).\n\nThe city's name \"Zaporizhia\" literally means the position of the city located ''beyond the rapids'' (later, in 1932 the rapids were flooded in order to build the [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]]).<ref name=\"Pospelov\" />\n\n==History==\n===Pre foundation history===\n[[File:Skifskaya baba.png|thumb|100px|left|A [[kurgan stelae|Kurgan stele]]<ref>This image of a kurgan stele has been taken in [[Kharkiv]], but one may find similar statues at Khortytsia Island</ref>]]\nArchaeological finds show that about two or three thousand years ago [[Scythians]] lived around the modern city.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Later, [[Khazars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans|Kuman]], [[Tatars]] and [[Slavs]] dwelt there.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] passed through the island of [[Khortytsia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} These territories were called the \"[[Wild Fields]]\", because they were not under the control of any state (it was the land between the highly eroded borders of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]).\n\nIn 1552 [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky]] erected wood-earth fortifications on the small island [[Mala Khortytsia|Little Khortytsia]] which is near the western shore of [[Khortytsia]] island.

In 20th doctrinaire idealistic enthusiasm of the architects was reflected in the intense debate about the habitation of the socialist community. The architects believed that by using new architectural forms they could create a new society. District No. 6 was one of the few implementations of urban development concepts. The construction of the district began in 1929 and finished in 1932. The main idea guiding the architects was the creation of the garden city, the city of the future. Multi-storey houses (not more than 4 floors) with large, roomy apartments were built in Sotsgorod with spacious yards planted with grass and trees around the buildings.\n[[Nikolai Kolli]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062845.html|title=\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0414\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|website=bse.sci-lib.com}}</ref> [[Vesnin brothers|V.A.Vesnin]], [[G.M.Orlov]], [[V.G.Lavrov]] and others designed the DniproHES and SotsGorod.

The architects used the ideas of the [[constructivist architecture]].\n\nThe ring house the building No. 31 at Independent Ukraine Street (formerly \u2013 40 years of Soviet Ukraine Street) was designed by V.G. Lavrov. Families of the Soviet and American engineers, advisors, and industry bosses lived in Sotsgorod at that time.

At the intersection between Sobornyi Avenue and Verkhnya Street, architect I.L. Kosliner set a tower with seven stories. This tower supposedly indicates the entrance gate of Sotsgorod from the south (from Alexandrovsk). Closer to the dam, the second tower was raised (architects I.L. Kosliner and L.Ya. Gershovich). Both towers point out a straight line of the central street of the district.\n\nThe names of the streets have changed several times. The original name of Metallurgist Avenue was Enthusiasts Alley. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This road leads to the factories. At that time, they believed that people going to the plant had only positive feelings like joy, pride, and enthusiasm. At the end of the road stands a 1963 sculpture of the metallurgist by sculptor Ivan Nosenko. During the German occupation, it was named [[Shevchenko]] Avenue.  Later it was renamed Stalin Avenue; and after his death, it got the present name of Metallurgist Avenue. Sobornyi Avenue originally had the name Libkhnet Avenue. \"Forty Years of Soviet Ukraine\" Street was once called Sovnarkomovska Street and during the German occupation Hitler Alley.\n\n'''Big Zaporizhia'''\n\nDistrict No. 6 is a small part of the global project called ''Big Zaporizhia''.

Initially, it was planned to disassemble it and rebuild it in another location. But expert advice was that this was not cost-effective as it was cheaper to build a new bridge.<ref name=Bridges/>\n\nThe building of the hydroelectric dam meant that a new bridge was required to take the railway over the Dnieper. Instead of having a single bridge, as before, it was decided to take the railway over the island [[Khortytsia]]. The wide part of the river between Khortytsia and the city is known as the New Dnieper, and the narrower part between Khortytsia and the suburbs on the right bank of the river is known as the Old Dnieper.<ref name=Bridges/> The New Dnieper was crossed by a three-arch two-tier bridge. Each of the arches spans 140 m. When the approach spans are included the total length is 715 m weighing 8,480 tons.<ref name=Bridges/> The Old Dnieper was crossed by a single-span arch bridge with a total length of 370 m; the arch spans of 224 m and was then the largest single-span bridge in Europe. This bridge weighed 5,220 tons.<ref name=Bridges/> Both bridges were designed by Professor Streletsky. They were made of riveted steel, and had two tiers: the upper tier for rail traffic and the lower tier for road traffic and pedestrians. They were assembled by a combination of Czechoslovakian and Soviet workers under the direction of a Soviet engineer named Konstantinov. The arches are steel made by the Vitkovetskom steel plant in [[Czechoslovakia]], other steelwork was made at the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant. The new bridges opened on 6 November 1931. The Kichkas Bridge was demolished afterwards.<ref name=Bridges/>\n\n===World War II (1941\u20131945)===\n[[File:ZaporizhiaCombat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Red Army soldier near the Dnieper hydro-electric dam]]\n\n====German occupation====\nThe war ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]) between the USSR and Germany began on 22 June 1941. \n\nAfter the outbreak of the war, the [[Soviet government]] started the evacuation of the industrial equipment from the city to [[Siberia]] .<ref name = zabor.zp.GPW/> The Soviet security forces [[NKVD]] shot political prisoners in the city.<ref>''Germany and the Second World War, Volume IV The Attack on the Soviet Union'', by [[Horst Boog]], [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]], [[Joachim Hoffmann]], [[Ernst Klink]], [[Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller]], [[Gerd R.

The project design is dated and needs revising, and the cost of the bridge is estimated to reach 8 billion hryvnias (as opposed to the original 2 billion).<ref>[https://fakty.ictv.ua/ru/videos/chomu-mosty-buduyut-po-14-rokiv-i-shho-kazhe-ukravtodor \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e 14 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u2013 \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440]</ref>\n\n===Euromaidan events, 2013\u20132014===\nDuring the [[2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations]] protests against President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were also held in Zaporizhia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0be4a86e-86b0-11e3-aa31-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref> On 23 February 2014 Zaporizhia's [[Local government in Ukraine|regional state administration]] building was occupied by 4,500 protesters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/888801-v-zaporoje-uchastniki-maydana-opechatali-kabinetyi-rukovodstva-zaporojskoy-oga.html |title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u044c\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0413\u0410 : \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0423\u041d\u0418\u0410\u041d |agency=Ukrainian Independent Information Agency |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> Mid-April 2014 there were clashes between Ukrainian activists and [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russians]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-04-13/ukraine-s-eastern-tension-turns-deadly-in-worst-case-scenario Ukraine Tensions Escalate as Russia, U.S. Exchange Barbs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915022529/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-04-13/ukraine-s-eastern-tension-turns-deadly-in-worst-case-scenario |date=15 September 2014 }}</ref> The Ukrainian activists outnumbered the pro-Russian protesters.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27012612 Ukraine crisis: What is happening where?], [[BBC News]] (15 April 2014)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-separatists-lay-siege-to-donetsk-oblast-as-ukrainian-government-struggles-to-combat-343288.html?flavour=mobile|title=Armed, pro-Russian separatists lay siege to Donetsk Oblast; at least three dead (VIDEOS, UPDATES) \u2013 Apr. 14, 2014|date=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaming city streets, plants, culture centers (2016)  ===\nIn the year of the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] (1917), the population of Alexandrovsk was about 60,000 people. In the year of the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] (1992), the city's population reached almost 1 million people. In 70 years, a small rural town turned into a large industrial, cultural and scientific center. In other words, the modern city was created in times of socialism and as a result, after 19 May 2016, when the Ukrainian parliament issued Law No. 275, which Ukrainians briefly called as the \"[[Decommunization in Ukraine|Decommunization Law]]\", the city council is forced to rename more than 50 main streets and the names of the administrative parts of the city, the monuments of the Soviet Union leaders ([[Lenin]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]) were destroyed.<ref>[http://zabor.zp.ua/www/content/polnyi-perechen-pereimenovannykh-v-zaporozhe-ulits \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u044c\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446]</ref> The names in honor of the others the Soviet leaders in the titles of the plants, factories, culture centers [[DniproHES]] were also removed.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is located in south-eastern [[Ukraine]].

The [[New Dnieper]] is about 800 m (2600 feet) wide and the Old Dnieper is about 200 m (650 feet). The island has  {{convert|12|x|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} sizes.  There are also several small rivers in the city, which enter the Dnieper: Sukha and [[Mokra Moskovka]], [[Kushuhum River|Kushuhum]], and [[Verkhnia Khortytsia]].\n\nThe flora of Khortytsia island is unique and diverse due to the dry steppe air and a large freshwater basin around, which cleans the polluted by industries air. Khortytsia Island is a national park.  The island surface is cut by large ravines (\"balka\"), hiking routes and historical monuments. The island is a very popular recreational area for both kids and adults. There are a large number of sanatoriums, resorts and health centers.

Well supplied with electricity, Zaporizhia forms, together with the adjoining Donets Basin and the [[Nikopol]] manganese and [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron mines, one of Ukraine's leading industrial complexes.\n\nThe city is also a home of the Ukraine's main automobile production center which is based at the [[ZAZ|Zaporizhia Automobile Factory]] ZAZ producing such Ukrainian car brands like ''Zaporozhets'' and ''Tavria''.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the city became an important industrial center. The presence of cheap labor and the proximity of deposits of coal, iron ore, and manganese created favorable conditions for large-scale enterprises of the iron and mechanical engineering industries. Today Zaporizhia is an important industrial center of the region with heavy industry (particularly [[metallurgy]]), aluminium, and chemical industry. In the city cars, avia motors, radioelectronics are manufactured. The port of Zaporizhia is an important place of transshipment for goods from the [[Donbas]].\n\n[[Zaporizhstal]], Ukraine's fourth largest steel maker, ranks 54th in the world and is based in the city.\n\n===Electricity generation===\nZaporizhia is a large electricity generating hub. There are [[hydroelectric]] [[power plant]] known as \"[[DniproHES]]\" [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] and the largest in Europe nuclear power plant. Zaporizhia plants generate about 25% of the whole Ukrainian electricity consumption. The [[Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant]] is located near the [[Enerhodar]] (trans. Energygifter), around 60&nbsp;km from Zaporizhia which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Also in Enerhodar, is the [[Zaporizhia thermal power station|Zaporizhia Thermal Power Station]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u042f.\u0406. \u041b\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430.jpg|thumb|220px| Magara Academic Drama Theatre]]\nZaporizhia has a [[philharmonic]], few museums, theaters, [[library|libraries]].

The city embraces the island by banks of the New and Old Dnieper streams.\nTwo concrete bridges connect the Island to the city.\nThey have been designed and constructed by the engineer '''Boris N. Preobrazhensky''' in 1952. Two level bridges have height about 54 meters. High level of the bridges is intended for rail and bottom  \u2013 for cars and pedestrians.\n\t\nThe historical and cultural '''museum \"Zaporizhian Sich\"''' is placed on the northern rocky part of the island Khotritsa.\nThe museum is the reconstructed stronghold of the Zaporizhian Cossacks. All features of the military cossack's camp life and their lifestyle are presented in the museum.\n\nThe smaller islands are located between the dam and the island Khortytsia. Each of these islands has its own legend. On one of them named Durnya Scala ('''Rock of the Fool''') [[Tzar]] [[Peter the Great]] punished the Cossacks by flogging for their betrayal on the side of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] during the [[Great Northern War]] between Russia and Sweden.\n\nThe another small island, named Stolb ('''Pillar'''), has a geological feature, which looks like a large bowl in granite slabs, its diameter equals 1,4 \u043c, the depth \u2013 1 \u043c. This bowl is named Cossack's bowl. People say that in summer days under the hot sun, it is easy to boil water in this \"bowl\" and the Cossacks used it for cooking galushki\n(boiled dough in a spicy broth)<ref>[http://www.gis.zp.ua/products/chortitza_1.htm Galina and Maxim Ostapenko, History of our Khortytsia (''\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e'' \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0446\u044b)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831103451/http://www.gis.zp.ua/products/chortitza_1.htm |date=31 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe panoramic view of the DnieproHES from Khortytsia island is very impressive.\nThe straight and long Sobornyi avenue (10&nbsp;km) ends in the '''SotsGorod''' near the Dam, which built up of the constructivist architecture of the 20th century.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe city of Zaporizhia is an important transportation hub in Ukraine and has deeply developed transportation system that includes roadway, rail, river and air options for passenger, freight as well as public utilities transit. Public city transport includes buses, minivans, trams, [[trolleybus]]es and railways.\n\nOn the eastern outskirts of Zaporizhia passes a major national highway M-18 that connects [[Kharkiv]] with [[Simferopol]]. Three other national highways terminate in Zaporizhia, one H-23 which starts in [[Kropyvnytskyi]] and through [[Kryvyi Rih]] ends in Zaporizhia; the second H-08 which starts in [[Kiev]] and travels along Dnieper all the way south passing through number of important cities such as [[Kremenchuk]], [[Kamianske]], [[Dnipro (city)|Dnipro]], and others; and the other highway H-15 which arrives to Zaporizhia from [[Donetsk]].\n\nThere are four road bridges over Dnieper and two rail bridges. All bridges but one connect the city with Khortytsia island. The other bridge goes over the river dam of [[DniproHES]].\n\nThe Zaporizhia city has two railway stations, Zaporizhia-the-First and Zaporizhia-the-Second. The First is the central station. It is located in the southern part of the city and is a part of the \"north-south\" transit route [[Simferopol]]-[[Kharkiv]]. The line of the Zaporizhia-the-Second station connects the [[Donbas]] coalfield with [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron ore site.\n\nThe city's two river ports are part of the national water transportation infrastructure that connects [[Kiev]] to [[Kherson]] along [[Dnieper]] river and utilizes some freight ships as well as [[Cutter (boat)|cutter boats]] to travel between Zaporizhia and nearby villages. The large island of Khortytsia splits the Dnieper into two branches (channels) the main branch that passes the island on its eastern side and the alternative branch also known as ''Staryi Dnipro'' (Old Dnieper) that flows past the island on its western side.\n\nThe [[Zaporizhia International Airport|city's sole airport]] that is located to the east of the city (left-bank of Dnieper) includes both domestic and international flights. To the west of the city (right-bank of Dnieper) is located smaller airfield Shyroke.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[:Category:People from Zaporizhia]]\n\n==In popular culture==\nZaporizhia is an important setting in two [[Axis victory in World War II]] short fictions by [[Harry Turtledove]]: \"[[Ready for the Fatherland]]\" (1991) and \"[[The Phantom Tolbukhin\"]] (1998).
