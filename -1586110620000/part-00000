Near the confluence of Elk and Mores Creeks, its plentiful water supply allowed it to outgrow the other nearby camps in the basin, such as [[Placerville, Idaho|Placerville]], Pioneerville, and Centerville. As its population swelled, the new [[Idaho Territory|Idaho Territorial]] legislature changed the town's name to \u201cIdaho City,\u201d to avoid confusion with [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]], in present-day [[Beaverhead County, Montana|Beaverhead County]], the southwestern corner of [[Montana]].\n\nAt its peak during the mid-1860s, there were more than 200 businesses in town, including three dozen saloons and two dozen law offices.<ref name=histidc>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6pBfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pzAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2421%2C5494204|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Morrissey|first=David|title=Western tall tale started Idaho City|date=March 19, 1976|page=9A}}</ref> Its 1864 population of 7,000 made it the largest city in the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest]], bigger than [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

The [[Grand Lodge of Idaho]] was founded in Idaho City in 1867. Idaho Lodge No. 1 was originally located in Idaho City, but is now in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].\n\nDuring the boom, the greater Boise Basin population numbered in the tens of thousands, but most departed the mountains once mining declined. Idaho City's population fell below 900 by 1870 and was down to 104 by 1920.

Annie Lee was one legendary Idaho city woman who like [[Polly Bemis]], escaped enslavement from the \u201cworld\u2019s oldest profession\u201d. She escaped from a member of the Yeong Wo Company in the 1870s to Boise to marry her lover, another Chinese man.

Near the confluence of Elk and Mores Creeks, its plentiful water supply allowed it to outgrow the other nearby camps in the basin, such as [[Placerville, Idaho|Placerville]], Pioneerville, and Centerville. As its population swelled, the new [[Idaho Territory|Idaho Territorial]] legislature changed the town\u2019s name to \u201cIdaho City,\u201d to avoid confusion with [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]], in present-day [[Beaverhead County, Montana|Beaverhead County]], the southwestern corner of [[Montana]].\n\nAt its peak during the mid-1860s, there were more than 200 businesses in town, including three dozen saloons and two dozen law offices.<ref name=histidc>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6pBfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pzAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2421%2C5494204|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Morrissey|first=David|title=Western tall tale started Idaho City|date=March 19, 1976|page=9A}}</ref> Its 1864 population of 7,000 made it the largest city in the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest]], bigger than [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

The [[Grand Lodge of Idaho]] was founded in Idaho City in 1867. Idaho Lodge No. 1 was originally located in Idaho City, but is now in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].\n\nDuring the boom, the greater Boise Basin population numbered in the tens of thousands, but most departed the mountains once mining declined. Idaho City\u2019s population fell below 900 by 1870 and was down to 104 by 1920.

Annie Lee was one legendary Idaho city woman who like [[Polly Bemis]], escaped enslavement from the \u201cworld\u2019s oldest profession\u201d. She escaped from a member of the Yeong Wo Company in the 1870s to Boise to marry her lover, another Chinese man.
