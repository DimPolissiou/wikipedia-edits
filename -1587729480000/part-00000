He sees this contradiction as ultimately unsolvable:\n<blockquote>Locke never addressed, much less resolved, this contradiction. On Afro-American slavery, silence seems to have been his principal bequest to posterity. Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>\nWhile Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C.

Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\".

For example, [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], in an essay published in September 1832, quoted approvingly British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) [[George Canning]]'s speech to the House of Commons of 16 March 1824 opposing abolition, in which he compared emancipated slaves to Shelley's Frankenstein.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rugemer|first=Edward B.|date=2004-05-01|title=The Southern Response to British Abolitionism: The Maturation of Proslavery Apologetics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/27648398?origin=crossref|journal=The Journal of Southern History|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=221|doi=10.2307/27648398}}</ref>\n\n==In the United States==\n{{main|Slavery as a positive good in the United States}}\nIn the United States, pro-slavery sentiment arose in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] period as a reaction to the growing [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movement in the United States in the late 18th century and early 19th century.

Tise argues against what he believes is the mistaken position that proslavery thought was unique to the antebellum American South:\n<blockquote>Among the numerous myths perpetuated by traditional interpretations of proslavery history, none has stood on shakier ground or proved more misleading than the notion that, for all practical purposes, proslavery was a phenomenon that appeared only in the antebellum South. From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E.

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.

Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>\nWhile Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C.

Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\".

From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E.

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.

Fidelis was [[Canonization|canonized]] in 1746.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born '''Mark Roy''' or '''Rey''' in 1577,<ref>{{cite book|title=Liturgy of the Hours|volume= II|chapter= Proper of Saints: 24 April|publisher=Catholic Book Publishing Co.|place=New York}}</ref> in  [[Sigmaringen]], a town in modern-day [[Germany]], then under the [[House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. His father's name was John Rey.  He studied law and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Freiburg]].\n\nRoy subsequently taught philosophy at this university, ultimately earning the degree of  [[Doctor of Law]]. During his time as a student he did not drink wine, and wore a [[Cilice|hair-shirt]]. He was known for his modesty, meekness and [[chastity]].\n\nIn 1604, Roy accompanied, as [[preceptor]] (teacher-mentor), three young [[Swabia]]n gentlemen on their travels through the principal parts of Europe. During six years of travel, he attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] very frequently.

He finished his [[novitiate]] and studies for the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]], presiding over his first Mass at the Capuchin [[friary]] in [[Fribourg]] (in present-day Switzerland), on October 4, 1612 (the feast day of St. [[Francis of Assisi]], founder of the order).\n\nAs soon as Fidelis finished his course of [[theology]], he was immediately employed in [[preaching]] and in hearing [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s.

During a severe epidemic in a city, Fidelis cared for and cured many sick soldiers.<ref name=fmedia/> Many residents of the town and neighboring places were reformed by his zealous labors, and several [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] were converted.

During the sermon, his listeners were called \"to arms\" by the Calvinist agitators outside. Some of the people went to face the Austrian troops outside the church.

In a meeting place for community, the building itself acts as a community of different programs and meanings, combining to make a whole. In a wider context, the museum refers to Melbourne's city grid in its planning, and integrates the landscape of Carlton Gardens, housing a Forest Gallery which is situated within the building, and also providing areas of exterior circulation around the building. Formally the Melbourne Museum is motivated by sculpture. Denton Corker Marshall manipulates sculptural forms to meet the constraints of the buildings context and program.<ref>Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper. (2002). Melbourne Museum.

In 1858, [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Frederick McCoy]] ([[Sir]] Frederick from 1891), who was  Professor of Natural History at the [[University of Melbourne]], was appointed Director of the National Museum.<ref>[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/Infosheets/11142.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831170623/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/Infosheets/11142.pdf|date=31 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne Museum was originally located (along with the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]] and the old state gallery) in the city block between La Trobe, [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston]], [[Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Little Lonsdale]] and [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]]s - the nearby Museum underground railway station was originally named after it, although following the move the station was renamed [[Melbourne Central Station|Melbourne Central]]. The State Library now uses all the space in that building, the gallery also having moved to the [[National Gallery of Victoria|NGV]] site in St Kilda Road.\n\nThe period in which the Victorian government was led by the Premier Sir [[Rupert Hamer]] (1972\u20131981) was one of policy development for museums in Victoria. Hamer's Arts Minister the Hon. [[Norman Lacy]] established a Museums Development Committee consisting of representatives of the Science Museum of Victoria, the National Museum of Victoria and the Ministry for the Arts. It considered such matters as the development of a single City Museum complex (leading eventually to the establishment of the new Melbourne Museum in Carlton) and programs in fields such as social history. The Committee also joined with a working party of the Victorian Council of the Arts to develop a comprehensive museums policy for Victoria.[https://archive.org/stream/TowardsAMuseumPolicyForVictoria#page/n0/mode/1up] Lacy also began the establishment of the [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]] with the acquisition of the property Heide II (in Bulleen east of Melbourne) and a collection of 113 art works from John and Sunday Reed in August 1980. It was officially opened in November 1981. He also developed a proposal for a Museum of Social and Political History [https://archive.org/stream/MuseumOfSocialAndPoliticalHistory#page/n0/mode/1up] at the [[Old Treasury Building, Melbourne|Old Treasury Building]] for the Executive Committee of Victoria's 150th Anniversary Celebrations in July 1981 which led to the establishment of the City Museum.\n\nThe new Melbourne Museum next to the [[Royal Exhibition Building|Exhibition Building]] in Carlton was constructed during the period of the Kennett government (1992\u20131999) was opened on 21 October 2000 by the [[Premier of Victoria]] at the time The Hon. [[Steve Bracks]]. The new Melbourne Museum included some significant changes to the historic methods of interpretation. One notable change was the inclusion of living organisms within the galleries. The centerpiece of the new building houses the Forest Gallery; a massive living and breathing exhibition offering a window into the tall forests of eastern Victoria. The Forest Gallery is home to the ongoing Forest Secrets exhibition which examines the agents of change within the forests. It includes hundreds of living plants and live animals such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.  In 2004 Melbourne Museum took another unique step for an Australian museum and created the permanent Bugs Alive! exhibition. This ground breaking exhibition showcases the roles and life-cycles of the critically important animal group - the [[invertebrate]]s. It features 50 living displays with an even greater number of species.\n\nThe new Melbourne Museum is located on the site of the former Melbourne Exhibition Speedway which operated from 5 November 1928 until 7 March 1936. The {{convert|413|yd|m|abbr=off}} [[Dirt track racing|dirt track speedway]] took place on a track laid out on the former sports oval and generally catered to motorcycle [[Motorcycle speedway|Solo]] and [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecar]] racing and is considered to be the birthplace of Sidecar speedway racing. The inaugural [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship]] was staged there in 1931 and was won by Victorians Les Medlycott and \"Tich\" Jones. The Exhibition Speedway also hosted the [[Victorian Individual Speedway Championship|Victorian Solo Championship]] from 1928/29 until 1934/35.\n\n== Main permanent exhibits ==\n[[File:Hoplostethus atlanticus 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|[[Natural history]] exhibit at Melbourne Museum (center specimen is an [[Orange Roughy]])]]\nThe main permanent exhibits include:\n* Science and Life Gallery - including a skeleton of a ''[[Diprotodon]]'' (a giant [[wombat]]-like creature), and skeletons of dinosaurs such as:\n** ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' (Giant meat eater, [[Tyrannosauridae]])\n** ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''  (Giant [[Sauropodus|sauropod]])\n** ''[[Tsintaosaurus]]''\n** ''[[Hadrosaurid]]''\n** ''[[Pteranodon]]''\n** ''[[Gallimimus]]''\n** ''[[Hypsilophodon]]''\nThe Science & Life Gallery also contains the exhibitions: \n* Bugs Alive!\n* Marine Life: Exploring our Seas\n* Large skeleton of a [[Pygmy Blue Whale|pygmy blue whale]]\n* Dinosaur Walk\n* Wild: Amazing Animals in a Changing World\nIn 2010 an exhibit called '600 million years: Victoria Evolves' opened, which includes some more prehistoric animals such as:\n* ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]''\n* ''[[Tiktaalik]]''\n* ''[[Anomalocaris]]''\nOther exhibits and galleries include:\n* Melbourne Gallery - where the [[Taxidermy|mounted hide]] of [[Phar Lap]], a race horse that won the [[Melbourne Cup]] during the depression era, is exhibited.\n* The Melbourne Story - A History of Melbourne from the early 19th century through to present day\n* Mind and Body Gallery - a gallery regarding the human body. It also features a world first exhibition about the mind called 'Mind: enter the labyrinth'.\n* Evolution Gallery - the upper level features the exhibition 'Darwin to DNA'.\n* Forest Gallery - a living temperate Victorian forest environment, complete with live birds, reptiles, and other fauna\n* Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre - including galleries with exhibitions by and about the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]] of Victoria\n* Te Pasifika Gallery - an exhibition which highlights the history and watercrafts of Pacific Islanders\n* Children's Gallery - exhibitions aimed at 3 to 8 year olds.\n* Touring Hall - is where international touring exhibitions are displayed. 'A Day In Pompeii' which was on display at Melbourne Museum from 26 June to 25 October 2009 was Melbourne Museum's most popular temporary exhibition. Past Touring Hall exhibitions include 'Hatching the Past: Dinosaur Eggs and Babies' (30 May 2008 to 24 August 2008), 'The Great Wall of China: Dynasties, dragons and warriors' (23 March 2007 to 22 July 2007), 'Spirit of the Games: the Opening Ceremony revealed' (18 March to 23 July 2006) and 'Dinosaurs from China' (2005).\n* Public spaces - Outside the main galleries are various displays relating to Victoria's and Australia's history, including [[CSIRAC]] (an early computer built in Australia) and a pygmy blue whale.\n\n== Festival Melbourne 2006 ==\n\nMelbourne Museum was one of the venues of Festival Melbourne 2006, a citywide art festival held in conjunction of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]], which was held in Melbourne. Among the exhibitions held in the museum were 'Common Goods:Cultures Meet Through Craft', which featured crafts made by artists from various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and 'CARVE:Indigenous carving practices', a series of demonstrations of traditional indigenous carving practices and techniques from Australia, [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]].\n\nBesides that, there was a producers' market, 'Victorian Producers' Market', where the best produces from regional Victoria such as wine, cheese and others were sold. A cooking competition, 'Culinary Pro Am of the Commonwealth' was also held between top Melbourne chefs, each representing a Commonwealth country.\n\nAnother crowd drawer was the large screen on museum grounds where live actions of the Games were shown.\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Melbourne Museum was one of Denton Corker Marshall's award-winning projects. One award in particular was the RACV Award for major tourist attraction, where it received 1,428,238 visitors during the years 2010\u20132011, which the Melbourne Museum received top honours for. In March 2012, the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards will be held in Cairns, where the Melbourne Museum will be represented for Victoria as a national level.<ref>[http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/media-centre/media-releases/melbourne-museum-wins-tourism-award/17/04/12 Unknown author, (16/11/11) Melbourne Museum wins Tourism Award]</ref>\nMelbourne Museum's Science and Life gallery was honoured with the Large Permanent Exhibition Award due to its outstanding design and flow, among many other awards during 2010\u20132011.<ref>[http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/media-centre/media-releases/a-week-of-awards-for-mv/ Unknown author, (21/11/11) Museum Victoria], , 17/04/12</ref> Their accomplishments have given them a place in numerous awards, being honoured for their high design quality throughout their international practises.

Contrasted against the neo-classical Royal Exhibition centre, Denton Corker Marshall separates the two with an events plaza, yet connects them again underground with a car park, defining their motto \"A new connection between the old, the new, past and future.\"<ref>Denton Corker Marshall Pty Ltd , Denton Corker Marshall \u2013 architecture and urban design,{{cite web |url=http://www.dentoncorkermarshall.com/profile.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080719121923/http://www.dentoncorkermarshall.com/profile.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }} 04/04/12</ref> Their approach to such a prominent part of Melbourne's historical and cultural infrastructure was to bring the past and existing exhibition building, into a new context and attempting to redefine a museums role as a public building.<ref>Paul Walker. (2001). Melbourne Museum: DCM's latest. Architecture Australia. 90, 44</ref> Denton Corker Marshall also envision the building to be just as responsive to its context as it is now, in the future. In a meeting place for community, the building itself acts as a community of different programs and meanings, combining to make a whole. In a wider context, the museum refers to Melbourne's city grid in its planning, and integrates the landscape of Carlton Gardens, housing a Forest Gallery which is situated within the building, and also providing areas of exterior circulation around the building. Formally the Melbourne Museum is motivated by sculpture. Denton Corker Marshall manipulates sculptural forms to meet the constraints of the buildings context and program.<ref>Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper. (2002). Melbourne Museum.

In 1858, [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Frederick McCoy]] ([[Sir]] Frederick from 1891), who was  Professor of Natural History at the [[University of Melbourne]], was appointed Director of the National Museum.<ref>[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/Infosheets/11142.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831170623/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/Infosheets/11142.pdf|date=31 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne Museum was originally located (along with the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]] and the old state gallery) in the city block between La Trobe, [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston]], [[Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Little Lonsdale]] and [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]]s - the nearby Museum underground railway station was originally named after it, although following the move the station was renamed [[Melbourne Central Station|Melbourne Central]]. The State Library now uses all the space in that building, the gallery also having moved to the [[National Gallery of Victoria|NGV]] site in St Kilda Road.\n\nThe period in which the Victorian government was led by the Premier Sir [[Rupert Hamer]] (1972\u20131981) was one of policy development for museums in Victoria. Hamer's Arts Minister the Hon. [[Norman Lacy]] established a Museums Development Committee consisting of representatives of the Science Museum of Victoria, the National Museum of Victoria and the Ministry for the Arts. It considered such matters as the development of a single City Museum complex (leading eventually to the establishment of the new Melbourne Museum in Carlton) and programs in fields such as social history. The Committee also joined with a working party of the Victorian Council of the Arts to develop a comprehensive museums policy for Victoria.[https://archive.org/stream/TowardsAMuseumPolicyForVictoria#page/n0/mode/1up] Lacy also began the establishment of the [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]] with the acquisition of the property Heide II (in Bulleen east of Melbourne) and a collection of 113 art works from John and Sunday Reed in August 1980. It was officially opened in November 1981. He also developed a proposal for a Museum of Social and Political History [https://archive.org/stream/MuseumOfSocialAndPoliticalHistory#page/n0/mode/1up] at the [[Old Treasury Building, Melbourne|Old Treasury Building]] for the Executive Committee of Victoria's 150th Anniversary Celebrations in July 1981 which led to the establishment of the City Museum.\n\nThe new Melbourne Museum next to the [[Exhibition Building]] in Carlton was constructed during the period of the Kennett government (1992\u20131999) was opened on 21 October 2000 by the [[Premier of Victoria]] at the time The Hon. [[Steve Bracks]]. The new Melbourne Museum included some significant changes to the historic methods of interpretation. One notable change was the inclusion of living organisms within the galleries. The centerpiece of the new building houses the Forest Gallery; a massive living and breathing exhibition offering a window into the tall forests of eastern Victoria. The Forest Gallery is home to the ongoing Forest Secrets exhibition which examines the agents of change within the forests. It includes hundreds of living plants and live animals such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.  In 2004 Melbourne Museum took another unique step for an Australian museum and created the permanent Bugs Alive! exhibition. This ground breaking exhibition showcases the roles and life-cycles of the critically important animal group - the [[invertebrate]]s. It features 50 living displays with an even greater number of species.\n\nThe new Melbourne Museum is located on the site of the former Melbourne Exhibition Speedway which operated from 5 November 1928 until 7 March 1936. The {{convert|413|yd|m|abbr=off}} [[Dirt track racing|dirt track speedway]] took place on a track laid out on the former sports oval and generally catered to motorcycle [[Motorcycle speedway|Solo]] and [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecar]] racing and is considered to be the birthplace of Sidecar speedway racing. The inaugural [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship]] was staged there in 1931 and was won by Victorians Les Medlycott and \"Tich\" Jones. The Exhibition Speedway also hosted the [[Victorian Individual Speedway Championship|Victorian Solo Championship]] from 1928/29 until 1934/35.\n\n== Main permanent exhibits ==\n[[File:Hoplostethus atlanticus 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|[[Natural history]] exhibit at Melbourne Museum (center specimen is an [[Orange Roughy]])]]\nThe main permanent exhibits include:\n* Science and Life Gallery - including a skeleton of a ''[[Diprotodon]]'' (a giant [[wombat]]-like creature), and skeletons of dinosaurs such as:\n** ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' (Giant meat eater, [[Tyrannosauridae]])\n** ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''  (Giant [[Sauropodus|sauropod]])\n** ''[[Tsintaosaurus]]''\n** ''[[Hadrosaurid]]''\n** ''[[Pteranodon]]''\n** ''[[Gallimimus]]''\n** ''[[Hypsilophodon]]''\nThe Science & Life Gallery also contains the exhibitions: \n* Bugs Alive!\n* Marine Life: Exploring our Seas\n* Large skeleton of a [[Pygmy Blue Whale|pygmy blue whale]]\n* Dinosaur Walk\n* Wild: Amazing Animals in a Changing World\nIn 2010 an exhibit called '600 million years: Victoria Evolves' opened, which includes some more prehistoric animals such as:\n* ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]''\n* ''[[Tiktaalik]]''\n* ''[[Anomalocaris]]''\nOther exhibits and galleries include:\n* Melbourne Gallery - where the [[Taxidermy|mounted hide]] of [[Phar Lap]], a race horse that won the [[Melbourne Cup]] during the depression era, is exhibited.\n* The Melbourne Story - A History of Melbourne from the early 19th century through to present day\n* Mind and Body Gallery - a gallery regarding the human body.

Among the exhibitions held in the museum were 'Common Goods:Cultures Meet Through Craft', which featured crafts made by artists from various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and 'CARVE:Indigenous carving practices', a series of demonstrations of traditional indigenous carving practices and techniques from Australia, [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]].\n\nBesides that, there was a producers' market, 'Victorian Producers' Market', where the best produces from regional Victoria such as wine, cheese and others were sold. A cooking competition, 'Culinary Pro Am of the Commonwealth' was also held between top Melbourne chefs, each representing a Commonwealth country.\n\nAnother crowd drawer was the large screen on museum grounds where live actions of the Games were shown.\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Melbourne Museum was one of Denton Corker Marshall's award-winning projects. One award in particular was the RACV Award for major tourist attraction, where it received 1,428,238 visitors during the years 2010\u20132011, which the Melbourne Museum received top honours for.
