This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].<ref>{{cite press release |author=Staff |date=March 31, 1981 |work=The New York Times |title=Science Watch: A Really Big Syzygy |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |accessdate=2008-02-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210100651/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref> Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned. An eclipse is the result of either an [[occultation]] (completely hidden) or a [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] (partially hidden).\n\nThe term eclipse is most often used to describe either a [[solar eclipse]], when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a [[lunar eclipse]], when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth\u2013Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A [[binary star]] system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.\n\nFor the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an \"[[eclipse season]]\", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The [[Solar eclipse#Types|type of solar eclipse]] that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on [[apparent size]]s of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. And if both orbits were perfectly circular, then each solar eclipse would be the same type every month. It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event. Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, are very rare events that can be many decades apart.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|\u00e9kleipsis}}''), which means \"the abandonment\", \"the downfall\", or \"the darkening of a heavenly body\", which is derived from the verb {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ekle\u00edp\u014d}}'') which means \"to abandon\", \"to darken\", or \"to cease to exist,\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&x=0&y=0  |accessdate=2009-09-24 |df= |title=in.gr}}</ref> a combination of prefix {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba-}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek-}}''), from preposition {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek}}''), \"out,\" and of verb {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|le\u00edp\u014d}}''), \"to be absent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do=dictionary&language_id_from=23&language_id_to=8&word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x=55&t.y=16|title=LingvoSoft|website=lingvozone.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128095850/http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do=dictionary&language_id_from=23&language_id_to=8&word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x=55&t.y=16|archivedate=2013-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate_t?prev=hp&hl=en&js=y&text=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89&sl=el&tl=en&history_state0=&swap=1#|title=Google Translate|author=|date=|website=translate.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Umbra, penumbra and antumbra ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra}}\n\n[[File:Umbra01.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra cast by an opaque object occulting a larger light source]]\nFor any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second. The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time.

During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable. This is because Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] crossing [[Mars]], or [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] entering Mars's penumbra.\n\nThe ''first contact'' occurs when the eclipsing object's disc first starts to impinge on the light source; ''second contact'' is when the disc moves completely within the light source; ''third contact'' when it starts to move out of the light; and ''fourth'' or ''last contact'' when it finally leaves the light source's disc entirely.\n\nFor spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (''L'') of the umbra's cone-shaped shadow is given by:\n\n:<math>L\\ =\\ \\frac{r \\cdot R_o}{R_s - R_o}</math>\n\nwhere ''R<sub>s</sub>'' is the radius of the star, ''R<sub>o</sub>'' is the occulting object's radius, and ''r'' is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For [[Earth]], on average ''L'' is equal to 1.384{{e|6}}&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]], which is much larger than the Moon's [[semimajor axis]] of 3.844{{e|5}}&nbsp;km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]].<ref>{{cite book \n|first=Robin M. |last=Green |date=1985 \n|title=Spherical Astronomy |publisher=Oxford University Press \n|isbn=978-0-521-31779-5 }}</ref> If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be [[refraction|refracted]] into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth&mdash;producing a faint, [[red|ruddy]] illumination of the Moon even at totality.\n\nOn Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1&nbsp;km per sec.

A particular instance is the [[saros (astronomy)|saros]], which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3&nbsp;days, or a little over 18 years.

Because the [[orbit of the Moon|orbital plane of the Moon]] is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the [[ecliptic]]), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the [[node (astronomy)|node]]s).

The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.<ref>{{cite web\n |first       = R.\n |last        = Hipschman\n |title       = Solar Eclipse: Why Eclipses Happen\n |url         = http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html\n |accessdate  = 2008-12-01\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205073238/http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-05\n|date        = 2015-10-29\n }}</ref>\n[[File:Solar eclipse visualisation.svg|thumb|upright|Each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the Moon (not to scale)]]\nThe [[Magnitude of eclipse|eclipse magnitude]] is the fraction of the Sun's diameter that is covered by the Moon.

Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7&nbsp;minutes, 31&nbsp;seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250&nbsp;km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700&nbsp;km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.\n\n[[File:Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)]]\n\nDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an [[occultation]] while an annular solar eclipse is a [[Astronomical transit|transit]].\n\nWhen observed at points in space other than from the Earth's surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth to eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn to eclipse the Sun]] in 2006.\n\n===Lunar eclipse===\n{{main|Lunar eclipse}}\n[[Image:Eclipse lune.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The progression of a [[lunar eclipse]] from right to left.

This happens only during a [[full moon]], when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.<ref>{{cite web\n |author      = Staff\n |date        = January 6, 2006\n |url         = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |title       = Solar and Lunar Eclipses\n |publisher   = NOAA\n |accessdate  = 2007-05-02\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512191007/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |archivedate = May 12, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's [[umbra]]; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth's umbra.

The most striking involve [[Jupiter]], which has four large moons and a low [[axial tilt]], making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter's cloudtops.\n\nThe eclipses of the [[Galilean moon]]s by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. [[Ole R\u00f8mer]] deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |title       = Roemer's Hypothesis\n |publisher   = MathPages\n |accessdate  = 2007-01-12\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224015233/http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |archivedate = 2011-02-24\n}}</ref>\n\nOn the other three [[gas giant]]s ([[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher [[inclination]] between the orbits of the moon and the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the planet. The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6\u00b0 to Saturn's equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27\u00b0. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn's orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7&nbsp;years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.\n\nThe timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's [[longitude]] upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as [[Greenwich]]), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse.

The result is a type of extrinsic [[variable star]] system called an [[eclipsing binary]].\n\nThe maximum [[luminosity]] of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease.

This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].<ref>{{cite press release |author=Staff |date=March 31, 1981 |work=The New York Times |title=Science Watch: A Really Big Syzygy |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |accessdate=2008-02-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210100651/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref> Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned. An eclipse is the result of either an [[occultation]] (completely hidden) or a [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] (partially hidden).\n\nThe term eclipse is most often used to describe either a [[solar eclipse]], when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a [[lunar eclipse]], when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth\u2013Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A [[binary star]] system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.\n\nFor the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an \"[[eclipse season]]\", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The [[Solar eclipse#Types|type of solar eclipse]] that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on [[apparent size]]s of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. And if both orbits were perfectly circular, then each solar eclipse would be the same type every month. It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event. Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, are very rare events that can be many decades apart.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|\u00e9kleipsis}}''), which means \"the abandonment\", \"the downfall\", or \"the darkening of a heavenly body\", which is derived from the verb {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ekle\u00edp\u014d}}'') which means \"to abandon\", \"to darken\", or \"to cease to exist,\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&x=0&y=0  |accessdate=2009-09-24 |df= |title=in.gr}}</ref> a combination of prefix {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba-}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek-}}''), from preposition {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek}}''), \"out,\" and of verb {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|le\u00edp\u014d}}''), \"to be absent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do=dictionary&language_id_from=23&language_id_to=8&word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x=55&t.y=16|title=LingvoSoft|website=lingvozone.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128095850/http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do=dictionary&language_id_from=23&language_id_to=8&word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x=55&t.y=16|archivedate=2013-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate_t?prev=hp&hl=en&js=y&text=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89&sl=el&tl=en&history_state0=&swap=1#|title=Google Translate|author=|date=|website=translate.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Umbra, penumbra and antumbra ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra}}\n\n[[File:Umbra01.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra cast by an opaque object occulting a larger light source]]\nFor any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second.

During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable. This is because Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] crossing [[Mars]], or [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] entering Mars's penumbra.\n\nThe ''first contact'' occurs when the eclipsing object's disc first starts to impinge on the light source; ''second contact'' is when the disc moves completely within the light source; ''third contact'' when it starts to move out of the light; and ''fourth'' or ''last contact'' when it finally leaves the light source's disc entirely.\n\nFor spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (''L'') of the umbra's cone-shaped shadow is given by:\n\n:<math>L\\ =\\ \\frac{r \\cdot R_o}{R_s - R_o}</math>\n\nwhere ''R<sub>s</sub>'' is the radius of the star, ''R<sub>o</sub>'' is the occulting object's radius, and ''r'' is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For [[Earth]], on average ''L'' is equal to 1.384{{e|6}}&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]], which is much larger than the Moon's [[semimajor axis]] of 3.844{{e|5}}&nbsp;km.

The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse.

Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7&nbsp;minutes, 31&nbsp;seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250&nbsp;km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700&nbsp;km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.\n\n[[File:Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)]]\n\nDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an [[occultation]] while an annular solar eclipse is a [[Astronomical transit|transit]].\n\nWhen observed at points in space other than from the Earth's surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth to eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn to eclipse the Sun]] in 2006.\n\n===Lunar eclipse===\n{{main|Lunar eclipse}}\n[[Image:Eclipse lune.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The progression of a [[lunar eclipse]] from right to left.

This happens only during a [[full moon]], when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.<ref>{{cite web\n |author      = Staff\n |date        = January 6, 2006\n |url         = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |title       = Solar and Lunar Eclipses\n |publisher   = NOAA\n |accessdate  = 2007-05-02\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512191007/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |archivedate = May 12, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's [[umbra]]; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth's umbra.

The black spot is Io's shadow.]]\n[[Image:Saturn eclipse.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Saturn]] occults the Sun as seen from the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens]]'' space probe]]\nThe [[gas giant]] planets have many moons and thus frequently display eclipses. The most striking involve [[Jupiter]], which has four large moons and a low [[axial tilt]], making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter's cloudtops.\n\nThe eclipses of the [[Galilean moon]]s by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. [[Ole R\u00f8mer]] deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |title       = Roemer's Hypothesis\n |publisher   = MathPages\n |accessdate  = 2007-01-12\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224015233/http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |archivedate = 2011-02-24\n}}</ref>\n\nOn the other three [[gas giant]]s ([[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher [[inclination]] between the orbits of the moon and the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the planet. The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6\u00b0 to Saturn's equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27\u00b0. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn's orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7&nbsp;years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.\n\nThe timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's [[longitude]] upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as [[Greenwich]]), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15\u00b0 around the Earth's equator. This technique was used, for example, by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni D. Cassini]] in 1679 to re-map [[France]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Cassini\n |first       = Giovanni D.\n |authorlink  = Giovanni Domenico Cassini\n |title       = Monsieur Cassini His New and Exact Tables for the Eclipses of the First Satellite of Jupiter, Reduced to the Julian Stile, and Meridian of London\n |journal     = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]\n |date        = 1694\n |volume      = 18\n |issue       = 207\u2013214\n |pages       = 237\u2013256\n |doi         = 10.1098/rstl.1694.0048\n |jstor       = 102468\n }}</ref>\n\n===Mars===\n{{main|Transit of Phobos from Mars}}\n[[Image:PIA05553.gif|right|thumbnail|[[Transit of Phobos from Mars]], as seen by the Mars ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity rover]]'' (10 March 2004).]]\nOn [[Mars]], only partial solar eclipses ([[Transit of Phobos from Mars|transits]]) are possible, because neither of its moons is large enough, at their respective orbital radii, to cover the Sun's disc as seen from the surface of the planet.

The result is a type of extrinsic [[variable star]] system called an [[eclipsing binary]].\n\nThe maximum [[luminosity]] of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars.

Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at \u00a321 per passenger.\n\nOn 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]].

By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924.

Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Global expansion====\nIn 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier.

The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.\n\nThere has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]].

Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]<ref>Amick, George. \"How The Airmail Got Off The Ground.\" American History 33.3 (1998): 48.

Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]].

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world.

However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free.

Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have \"deregulated\" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.\nThe entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.<ref>\"Too Much of a Good Thing.\" ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.</ref>\n\n===International===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2020}}[[File:La Maison de l-OACI - 11a.jpg|thumb|[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] headquarters in [[Montreal]]]]\n\nGroups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.\n\nBilateral agreements are based on the \"[[freedoms of the air]]\", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"[[open skies]]\" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.\n\n==Economic considerations==\n\nIn 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.<!--<ref name=ATAGOct2018>--> In 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].<ref name=ATAGOct2018>{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July\u2013August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top 150 airline groups<ref name=WorldAirlineRankings2017>{{cite web |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/18223 |title= World Airline Rankings |date= 2017 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n! !! 2016 !! 2015 !! 2014 !! 2013 !! 2012 !! 2011 !! 2010 !! 2009 !! 2008\n|-\n!

Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMost airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (\"O&D control\"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term \"[[fare war]]\" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in \"legacy\" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nComputers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for \"no-shows\", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What\u2019s the world\u2019s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines\u2019 Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==== Elasticity ====\n\nThe demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author=David W.

Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMoreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnalysis of the 1992\u20131996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales.

The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]\nAirline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000\u20132005 period.\n\nIn view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIf a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wtop.com/baltimore/2018/11/which-d-c-area-airport-is-busiest/|title=Which DC-area airport is busiest?|date=2018-11-21|website=WTOP|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\nOther factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Airline partnerships===\n{{largest airline alliances}}\n\n[[Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]\u2013[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]\u2013[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Brussels]]\u2013[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSince airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as \"show me flights from Chicago to D\u00fcsseldorf\"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago\u2013[[D\u00fcsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to D\u00fcsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. The largest are [[Star Alliance]], [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]], and these accounted for over 60% of global commercial air traffic {{As of|2015||df=|lc=y}}.<ref name=\":7\" /> Alliances of airlines coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets and often engage in extensive [[codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations\u2014sometimes including cross-equity arrangements\u2014in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.\n\nOften the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fuel hedging===\n{{Main|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.<ref name = economist>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/01/fuel-hedging-and-airlines|title=Gambles that haven't paid off|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date= | language =en}}</ref>\n\nSouthwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy. Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.<ref name = economist/>\n\n=== Seasonality ===\nAirlines often have a strong [[seasonality]], with traffic low in [[Winter]] and peaking in [[Summer]]. In Europe the most extreme market are the [[Greek islands]] with July/August having more than ten times the winter traffic, as [[Jet2]] is the most seasonal among [[low-cost carrier]]s with July having seven times the January traffic, whereas [[legacy carrier]]s are much less with only 85/115% variability.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.anna.aero/2017/03/01/greek-islands-jet2-com-seasonality-losers-europe/ |title= Seasonality: Jet2.com and Greek Islands most extreme in anna.aero leisure-legacy comparison |work= Airline Network News and Analysis |date= 1 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impacts==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n[[File:Contrails southeast lrg.png|thumb|[[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] tracking of [[contrail]]s generated by air traffic over the southeastern United States on January 29, 2004.]]\n\nAircraft engines emit [[noise pollution]], gases and particulate emissions, and contribute to [[global dimming]].<ref name=contrails>{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range |first=David J. |last=Travis |author2=Carleton, Andrew M. |author3=Lauritsen, Ryan G |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |page=601 |volume=418 |year=2002 |url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |doi=10.1038/418601a |format=PDF |pmid=12167846 |issue=6898 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-03 |bibcode=2002Natur.418..601T }}</ref>\n\nGrowth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions.\n\nDomestic air transport grew in China at 15.5 percent annually from 2001 to 2006.

For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of one of its predecessors, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.\n\n==Airline personnel==\n\n[[File:787 Dreamliner cabin crew and pilots (10167536115).jpg|thumb|The [[aircrew]] of a [[Jetstar Airways]] Boeing 787]]\n\nThe various types of airline personnel include:\n* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft.

This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}</ref> Many major airlines operating between the 1940s and 1980s were government-owned or government-established. However, most airlines from the earliest days of air travel in the 1920s and 1930s were personal businesses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGrowth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2\u20133% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said \"the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett\u2019s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAs in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s.<ref name=\":6\" /> Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Air charter]]\n* [[Air ferry]]\n* [[Airline alliance]]\n* [[Airline complaints]]\n* [[Airline timetable]]\n* [[Airliners.net]]\n* [[Airlines of Africa]]\n* [[Airport security]]\n* [[Aviation safety]]\n* [[Freedoms of the air#Beyond rights|Beyond rights]]\n* [[Cargo airline]]\n* [[Domestic flight]]\n* [[Environmental impact of aviation]]\n* [[Federal Aviation Administration]]\n* [[Flight length]]\n* [[Flight planning]]\n* [[FlightAware]]\n* [[Government contract flight]]\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)|Hyper-mobile travel]]\n* [[Inflight magazine]]\n* [[International Air Transport Association]]\n* [[International flight]]\n* [[Legacy carrier]]\n* [[Low-cost carrier]]\n* [[Red-eye flight]]\n* [[Regional airline]]\n* [[Transportation Security Administration]]\n* [[World's busiest passenger air routes]]\n}}\n\n===Airline related lists===\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Airline codes]]\n* [[Airline liveries and logos]]\n* [[List of airlines]]\n* [[List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft]]\n* [[List of airline holding companies]]\n* [[List of airline mergers and acquisitions]]\n* [[List of defunct airlines]]\n* [[List of helicopter airlines]]\n* [[List of hub airports]]\n* [[List of low-cost airlines]]\n* [[Flag carrier|List of national airlines]]\n* [[List of regional airlines]]\n* [[Airline bankruptcies in the United States]]\n* [[World's largest airlines]]\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n# \"A history of the world's airlines\", [[R.

Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at \u00a321 per passenger.\n\nOn 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]].

By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924.

In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies.

Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Global expansion====\nIn 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier.

The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant.

New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid-off staff from other airlines.\n\nMajor airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref name=\"Andrew R.

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world.

However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====The airline industry bailout====\n\nCongress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]].

Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have \"deregulated\" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.\nThe entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.<ref>\"Too Much of a Good Thing.\" ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.</ref>\n\n===International===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2020}}[[File:La Maison de l-OACI - 11a.jpg|thumb|[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] headquarters in [[Montreal]]]]\n\nGroups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.\n\nBilateral agreements are based on the \"[[freedoms of the air]]\", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"[[open skies]]\" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.\n\n==Economic considerations==\n\nIn 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.<!--<ref name=ATAGOct2018>--> In 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].<ref name=ATAGOct2018>{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July\u2013August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top 150 airline groups<ref name=WorldAirlineRankings2017>{{cite web |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/18223 |title= World Airline Rankings |date= 2017 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n! !! 2016 !! 2015 !! 2014 !! 2013 !! 2012 !! 2011 !! 2010 !! 2009 !! 2008\n|-\n!

A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highway]]s and [[Rail transport|railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.<ref>Rigas Doganis, \"Alternative Pricing Strategies\", ''Flying Off Course: The Economics of International Airlines'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 267-69. {{ISBN|1134887779}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Airline Facts for Kids |url=https://kids.kiddle.co/Airline |website=Kiddle |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Airline Deregulation Act|1978 deregulation]], U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate [[economic profit|profit]] for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined [[economic loss|losses]] amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.<!--<ref name=AvWeek14May2018/>--> They drop loss-making routes, avoid [[fare war]]s and [[market share]] battles, limit [[Seating capacity|capacity]] growth, add [[airline hub|hub]] feed with [[regional jet]]s to increase their [[profitability]].

The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBecause of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMost airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (\"O&D control\"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term \"[[fare war]]\" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in \"legacy\" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nComputers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for \"no-shows\", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What\u2019s the world\u2019s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines\u2019 Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==== Elasticity ====\n\nThe demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author=David W.

Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMoreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnalysis of the 1992\u20131996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2\u20133.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10\u201313%, handling companies 11\u201314%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%.

The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]\nAirline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000\u20132005 period.\n\nIn view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIf a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wtop.com/baltimore/2018/11/which-d-c-area-airport-is-busiest/|title=Which DC-area airport is busiest?|date=2018-11-21|website=WTOP|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\nOther factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Airline partnerships===\n{{largest airline alliances}}\n\n[[Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]\u2013[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]\u2013[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Brussels]]\u2013[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSince airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as \"show me flights from Chicago to D\u00fcsseldorf\"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago\u2013[[D\u00fcsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to D\u00fcsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. The largest are [[Star Alliance]], [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]], and these accounted for over 60% of global commercial air traffic {{As of|2015||df=|lc=y}}.<ref name=\":7\" /> Alliances of airlines coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets and often engage in extensive [[codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations\u2014sometimes including cross-equity arrangements\u2014in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.\n\nOften the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fuel hedging===\n{{Main|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.<ref name = economist>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/01/fuel-hedging-and-airlines|title=Gambles that haven't paid off|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date= | language =en}}</ref>\n\nSouthwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy.

Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of one of its predecessors, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.\n\n==Airline personnel==\n\n[[File:787 Dreamliner cabin crew and pilots (10167536115).jpg|thumb|The [[aircrew]] of a [[Jetstar Airways]] Boeing 787]]\n\nThe various types of airline personnel include:\n* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft.

Swiss Air Lines, United Airlines, Thai Airways.JPG|thumb|Aircraft of various airlines parked side by side at Tokyo Narita Airport, Japan]]\n\nThe pattern of ownership has been privatized since the mid-1980s, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}</ref> Many major airlines operating between the 1940s and 1980s were government-owned or government-established. However, most airlines from the earliest days of air travel in the 1920s and 1930s were personal businesses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGrowth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2\u20133% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said \"the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett\u2019s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAs in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s.<ref name=\":6\" /> Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Air charter]]\n* [[Air ferry]]\n* [[Airline alliance]]\n* [[Airline complaints]]\n* [[Airline timetable]]\n* [[Airliners.net]]\n* [[Airlines of Africa]]\n* [[Airport security]]\n* [[Aviation safety]]\n* [[Freedoms of the air#Beyond rights|Beyond rights]]\n* [[Cargo airline]]\n* [[Domestic flight]]\n* [[Environmental impact of aviation]]\n* [[Federal Aviation Administration]]\n* [[Flight length]]\n* [[Flight planning]]\n* [[FlightAware]]\n* [[Government contract flight]]\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)|Hyper-mobile travel]]\n* [[Inflight magazine]]\n* [[International Air Transport Association]]\n* [[International flight]]\n* [[Legacy carrier]]\n* [[Low-cost carrier]]\n* [[Red-eye flight]]\n* [[Regional airline]]\n* [[Transportation Security Administration]]\n* [[World's busiest passenger air routes]]\n}}\n\n===Airline related lists===\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Airline codes]]\n* [[Airline liveries and logos]]\n* [[List of airlines]]\n* [[List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft]]\n* [[List of airline holding companies]]\n* [[List of airline mergers and acquisitions]]\n* [[List of defunct airlines]]\n* [[List of helicopter airlines]]\n* [[List of hub airports]]\n* [[List of low-cost airlines]]\n* [[Flag carrier|List of national airlines]]\n* [[List of regional airlines]]\n* [[Airline bankruptcies in the United States]]\n* [[World's largest airlines]]\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n# \"A history of the world's airlines\", [[R.

That year, the Royals selected Gordon with the second overall pick in the [[2005 MLB Draft]]. Gordon made his major league debut at a [[third baseman]], but had an inconsistent beginning to his career.  In 2010, the Royals made Gordon an [[outfielder]].  Gordon was a member of the Royals' [[2015 World Series]] championship team, and signed a [[free agent]] contract that offseason to remain with the team. Gordon has won seven [[Gold Glove Award]]s, four [[Fielding Bible Award]]s, and a [[Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in MLB, all after the move to the outfield.\n\n==Early life==\nGordon was born on February 10, 1984 to a family heavily involved in baseball.

{"title_page": "Falsifiability", "text_new": "{{short description|possibility of a statement to be proven wrong by observation}}\n\n[[File:Black Swans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Pair of black swans swimming| The observation of these black swans contradicts the law \"All swans are white\", but even if there were no black swans, the law would still be falsifiable, because identifying a swan and observing the color black would remain possible.]]\n[[File:Corvus corax (FWS) red.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Likewise, the law \"All ravens are black\" is falsifiable, although it is still held to be true. Observing e.g. a red raven could show it to be false. In contrast, the sentence \"Some time, a red raven will appear\" is not falsifiable since it is too unspecific to admit a contradicting observation.]]\n\n{{Lead too short|date=March 2020}}\nInformally,  a statement is falsifiable if some observation might show it to be false. For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==Critical rationalism as a solution to the problem of induction==\nPopper noticed that two types of statements are of particular value to scientists. The first are statements of [[observation]]s, such as 'this is a white swan'. [[Logic|Logicians]] describe such statements in terms of [[existential quantification]], since they assert the ''existence'' of some particular thing. For Popper, such statements form the '''empirical basis''' of scientific theory.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}} The second type of statement of interest to scientists categorises all instances of something, for example \"All swans are white\". Logicians describe these in terms of [[universal quantification]].\n\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? From an existential statement to a universal statement? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would be to  [[Affirming the consequent|affirm the consequent]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> These observation or basic statements constitute the empirical \"basis\". The empirical basis thus depends on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Historical context : logical positivism===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Kaye{{efn-ua | Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H.

It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts.

Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims.

Observing e.g. a red raven could show it to be false. In contrast, the sentence \"Some time, a red raven will appear\" is not falsifiable since it is too unspecific to admit a contradicting observation.]]\n\n{{Lead too short|date=March 2020}}\nInformally,  a statement is falsifiable if some observation might show it to be false. For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==Critical rationalism as a solution to the problem of induction==\nPopper noticed that two types of statements are of particular value to scientists. The first are statements of [[observation]]s, such as 'this is a white swan'. [[Logic|Logicians]] describe such statements in terms of [[existential quantification]], since they assert the ''existence'' of some particular thing. For Popper, such statements form the '''empirical basis''' of scientific theory.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}} The second type of statement of interest to scientists categorises all instances of something, for example \"All swans are white\". Logicians describe these in terms of [[universal quantification]].\n\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? From an existential statement to a universal statement? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would be to  [[Affirming the consequent|affirm the consequent]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> These observation or basic statements constitute the empirical \"basis\". The empirical basis thus depends on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Historical context : logical positivism===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Kaye{{efn-ua | Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H. Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].}} argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that \"inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations.\"{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: \"... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

The reserve was eventually closed but some residents were allowed to remain, with the community being granted ownership in 1971 of the {{convert|237|ha|km2}} they held at that time.<ref name=\"scars_on_the_landscape_pp125\">Ian D.

As parts of the reserve were sold to private landowners, its size diminished, until only the {{convert|586|acre|km2}} remained when it was closed in 1971.

Under the provisions of that Act, ownership of Framlingham was handed over to a trust held by Aboriginal residents of the site, Framlingham Aboriginal Trust,<ref name=atns/> on 1 July 1971. Along with Lake Tyers, in the eastern [[Gippsland]] region of the state, Framlingham was the last reserve to close in Victoria.\n\nIn 1976 the Framlingham community began a campaign to regain rights to the Framlingham Forest, that had been excised from the original 1861 reserve in 1894. In April 1979 the community blockaded the road to the forest picnic ground. The Victorian Government proposed allowing Aboriginal management of the forest in 1980 but maintained that it would continue as crown land. The proposal was rejected by the community, who resumed the blockade.<ref name=\"scars_on_the_landscape_pp125\" /><ref>Kerry Wakefield, pp3, ''Warrnambool blacks had century of misery: report'', [[The Age]], 2 September 1980.
