Later [[coal mining]], [[brick]] manufacture, [[iron]] casting and [[engineering]] rose to prominence.<ref name=\"bchistory\" /> Very fine red earthenware and also [[soft-paste porcelain]] [[tableware]] (the first such production in Staffordshire) was produced in Newcastle at Samuel Bell's factory in Lower Street between 1724 and 1754, when production ceased. With the exception of a failed enterprise between 1790 and 1797, which then switched to [[brewing]], there was no further commercial production of pottery within the town of Newcastle. Production of earthenware tiles, however, continued at several locations within the borough. Manufacture of fine [[bone china]] was re-established in the borough in 1963 by [[Mayfair Pottery]] at [[Chesterton, Staffordshire|Chesterton]].\n\nThe manufacture in the borough of clay [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco-smoking pipes]] started about 1637 and grew rapidly, until it was second only to hatting as an industry. Nationally, the town ranked with [[Chester]], [[York]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] as the four major pipe producers. The industry continued until the mid-19th century, when decline set in rapidly, so that by 1881 there was only one tobacco-pipe maker left.\n\nIn the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the town had a flourishing [[felt]] hat manufacturing industry,<ref name=\"bchistory\" /> which was probably at its peak locally in the 1820s, when a third of the town's population were involved in over 20 factories, but by 1892 there was only one manufacturer still in production.\n\nIn 1944, the [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]] engine for the [[Gloster Meteor]] fighter was made in the borough.\n\nNewcastle's 20th-century industries include: iron-working, construction materials, clothing (especially military, police and transport uniforms), computers, publishing, electric motors and machinery.\n\nNear the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the town received major redevelopment to incorporate a new street (Castle Walk) into the town centre, providing Newcastle with a new [[bus station]] and bringing in more companies. Various business centres in the town provide offices for companies that operate in the service sector.\n\n===Politicians===\n[[File:Vera Brittain.jpg|thumb|Vera Brittain]]\nThe town has been the birthplace of several notable politicians and activists. [[Fanny Deakin]] was a campaigner for better nourishment for babies and young children and better maternity care for mothers. The former [[chairwoman]] of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] ([[CND]]), [[Janet Bloomfield]] (n\u00e9e Hood) is a peace and disarmament campaigner.

Only small sections remained from Madeley to Silverdale, and from Silverdale to Holditch, for coal traffic from the local collieries. The line from Newcastle Junction to Silverdale has been removed, with the site of Newcastle railway station and the Hartshill tunnels being filled in.\n\nNewcastle was on the national [[canal]] network, but the [[Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal]], running from the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at Stoke-on-Trent to [[Sir Nigel Gresley's Canal]] has been disused since 1935 and most of it filled in.\n\nToday the town relies on buses for its public transport.

The new castle was built to supersede an older fortress at [[Chesterton, Staffordshire|Chesterton]] about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} to the north, the ruins of which were visible up to the end of the 16th century.\n\nIn 1235 [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] constituted it a free borough, granting a [[guild]] merchant and other privileges.<ref name=\"bchistory\" /> In 1251 he leased it under a [[fee farm grant]] to the burgesses. In 1265 Newcastle was granted by the [[The Crown|Crown]] to [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], and subsequently to [[Edmund Crouchback]], through whom it passed to [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].

Later [[coal mining]], [[brick]] manufacture, [[iron]] casting and [[engineering]] rose to prominence.<ref name=\"bchistory\" /> Very fine red earthenware and also [[soft-paste porcelain]] [[tableware]] (the first such production in Staffordshire) was produced in Newcastle at Samuel Bell's factory in Lower Street between 1724 and 1754, when production ceased. With the exception of a failed enterprise between 1790 and 1797, which then switched to [[brewing]], there was no further commercial production of pottery within the town of Newcastle. Production of earthenware tiles, however, continued at several locations within the borough. Manufacture of fine [[bone china]] was re-established in the borough in 1963 by [[Mayfair Pottery]] at [[Chesterton, Staffordshire|Chesterton]].\n\nThe manufacture in the borough of clay [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco-smoking pipes]] started about 1637 and grew rapidly, until it was second only to hatting as an industry. Nationally, the town ranked with [[Chester]], [[York]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] as the four major pipe producers. The industry continued until the mid-19th century, when decline set in rapidly, so that by 1881 there was only one tobacco-pipe maker left.\n\nIn the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the town had a flourishing [[felt]] hat manufacturing industry,<ref name=\"bchistory\" /> which was probably at its peak locally in the 1820s, when a third of the town's population were involved in over 20 factories, but by 1892 there was only one manufacturer still in production.\n\nIn 1944, the [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]] engine for the [[Gloster Meteor]] fighter was made in the borough.\n\nNewcastle's 20th-century industries include: iron-working, construction materials, clothing (especially military, police and transport uniforms), computers, publishing, electric motors and machinery.\n\nNear the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the town received major redevelopment to incorporate a new street (Castle Walk) into the town centre, providing Newcastle with a new [[bus station]] and bringing in more companies. Various business centres in the town provide offices for companies that operate in the service sector.\n\n===Politicians===\n[[File:Vera Brittain.jpg|thumb|Vera Brittain]]\nThe town has been the birthplace of several notable politicians and activists. [[Fanny Deakin]] was a campaigner for better nourishment for babies and young children and better maternity care for mothers. The former [[chairwoman]] of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] ([[CND]]), [[Janet Bloomfield]] (n\u00e9e Hood) is a peace and disarmament campaigner. [[Vera Brittain]]  writer, [[feminist]] (and mother of [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Shirley Williams]]) was born in the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newcastle-staffs.gov.uk/General.asp?id=SXA203-A77FA129 |title=Vera Brittain 1893\u20131970 |publisher=Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council |accessdate=6 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901100123/http://www.newcastle-staffs.gov.uk/general.asp?id=SXA203-A77FA129 |archivedate=1 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two particularly notable [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs).

Only small sections remained from Madeley to Silverdale, and from Silverdale to Holditch, for coal traffic from the local collieries. The line from Newcastle Junction to Silverdale has been removed, with the site of Newcastle railway station and the Hartshill tunnels being filled in.\n\nNewcastle was on the national [[canal]] network, but the [[Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal]], running from the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at Stoke-on-Trent to [[Sir Nigel Gresley's Canal]] has been disused since 1935 and most of it filled in.\n\nToday the town relies on buses for its public transport.

Etsy thought this feature would allow Etsy users to connect to individuals with similar buying and/or selling histories and an automatic opt-in was applied to all users without the attainment of prior permission. Users of the service raised concerns over the feature's violation of privacy rights, but an official response was not released by the company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Etsy users irked after buyers, purchases exposed to the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2011/03/etsy-users-irked-after-buyers-purchases-exposed-to-the-world/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=7 November 2013|author=Jacqui Cheng|date=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Production outsourcing===\nOn Oct 1, 2013, Etsy changed its policy to allow sellers to outsource production to third parties and factories and to use shipping or fulfillment services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Etsy's Future depends on redefining 'handmade'|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/why-etsys-future-depends-on-leaving-behind-the-simply-handmade/|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> The new rules allow products to be labeled \"handmade\" as long as the original idea for that item \u2014 or its \"authorship\" as C.E.O.

Manufacturers must be reviewed and approved by Etsy to ensure they adhere to certain criteria, although Etsy will not conduct visits or in-person inspections. Sellers must apply and be approved to work with any partners listed on Etsy Manufacturing and are required to disclose their use of outside manufacturers on their pages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Etsy Welcomes Manufacturers to Artisanal Fold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/etsy-welcomes-manufacturers-to-artisanal-fold.html?_r=0}}</ref>\n\n=== Advertising requirements ===\nIn February 2020, Etsy announced a new \"risk free\" product advertising program, replacing an existing system allowing sellers to purchase ads on platforms such as [[Google Shopping]] from within Etsy. The company will automatically purchase advertising for products on \"high-traffic\" websites, with sales generated by these leads subject to a 15% cut of revenue from the total of the order. Etsy expected at least \"1 in 10\" leads to come from these ads. All sellers will be automatically opted into this program, but sellers with an annual revenue of $10,000 or higher (which will be subject to a 12% cut instead) are required to participate and may not opt out. The system has faced criticism from sellers, who have characterized the new system as a means for the company to further siphon revenue from its sellers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21155193/etsy-advertising-program-angers-sellers-cut-of-sales|title=Etsy tells sellers it\u2019s going to advertise their goods and take a big cut of the sale|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2020-02-26|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/etsy-offsite-ads-program-sellers-backlash/|title=Etsy sellers are furious over new mandatory ad fees|last=Yeo|first=Amanda|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vintage (design)]]\n* [[Vintage clothing]]\n* [[Tech companies in the New York City metropolitan region]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* David Gelles, [https://web.archive.org/web/20171126090111/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/business/etsy-josh-silverman.html \"Inside the Revolution at Etsy,\"] ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2017.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Etsy}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 2005]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2005]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Online marketplaces of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:2015 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|E-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items}}\n{{Infobox website\n| name = Etsy\n| logo = Etsy_logo.svg\n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| url = {{URL|etsy.com}}\n| commercial = Yes\n| type = [[E-commerce]]\n| registration = Required to buy or sell\n| owner = Etsy, Inc.\n| country = United States<ref>https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=716408-77778</ref>\n| traded_as = {{NASDAQ|ETSY}}<br>[[S&P 400]] Component<br>[[Russell 1000 Index|Russell 1000 Component]]\n| author = Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, Haim Schoppik, and later Jared Tarbell\n| launch_date = {{start date and age|2005|6|18}}\n| current_status = \n| alexa = {{Decrease}} 151 ({{as of|2020|04|11|alt=April 2020}})<ref name=\"alexa\">{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/Etsy.com |title= Etsy.com Site Info | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate=2020-04-20 }}</ref>\n| revenue = US$603.7 million (2018)\n}}\n\n'''Etsy''' is an American [[e-commerce]] [[website]] focused on [[handicraft|handmade]] or [[Vintage (design)|vintage]] items and [[craft]] supplies.

Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called \"cavitation\". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.\n\nThe process in which a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]], is called inertial cavitation. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.\n\nSince the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to parts, cavitation is typically an undesirable phenomenon in machinery (although desirable if intentionally used, for example, to sterilize contaminated surgical instruments, break down pollutants in water purification systems, [[emulsify]] tissue for cataract surgery or kidney stone [[lithotripsy]], or [[homogenize]] fluids). It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].\n\n== Physics ==\n\nInertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.\n\nOther ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233\u2013252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}</ref>\n\nInertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.\n\nThe physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}</ref>\n\nIn order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation \"bubbles\" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.\n\nThe vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.\n\n==Hydrodynamic cavitation==\nHydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.\n\nThe process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=STOPAR |first1=DAVID |title=HYDRODYNAMIC CAVITATION |url=https://davidstopar.wixsite.com/home/hydrodynamic-cavitation |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nOrifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChE Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641\u20131648 }}</ref>\n\nThe cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes.

These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.<ref>[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain</ref>\n\nThis is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P.

Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).\n\nCavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].\n\nUse of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}</ref><!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. -->\n\nHydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together.

The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away in the hope that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned (which is a possibility when the object is immersed, for example in an ultrasonic cleaning bath). The same physical forces that remove contaminants also have the potential to damage the target being cleaned.\n\n=== Food and beverage ===\n\n==== Eggs ====\nCavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within.

This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}</ref>\n\n===Pumps and propellers===\nMajor places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.\n\nAs an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure can become around it. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.\n\nCavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:\n\n====Suction cavitation====\n[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.\n\nCommon causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.\n\n====Discharge cavitation====\nDischarge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.\n\nDischarge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.\n\n====Cavitation solutions====\nSince all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.\n\nTo have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.<ref>[[Pulp & Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes</ref>\nTo overcome cavitation:\nIncrease suction pressure if possible.\nDecrease liquid temperature if possible.\nThrottle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.\nVent gases off the pump casing.\n\n===Control valves===\n\nCavitation can occur in [[control valves]].<ref>[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136</ref>  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.\n\n===Spillways===\nWhen water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.\n\nExperimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between {{cvt|12|and|15|m/s|mph|}}, and, up to flow velocities of {{cvt|20|m/s|mph|||}}, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.<ref name=\"Volkart_Rutschmann_1984\">{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors \u2013 A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.\n\n===Engines===\nSome larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.\n\nIt is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.\n\nFrom about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.\n\n==In nature==\n\n===Geology===\nSome hypotheses{{by who|date=December 2019}}{{examples|date=December 2019}} relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation\u2014namely cavitation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now{{when|date=December 2019}} understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat.

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation.\n\n===Vascular plants===\nCavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.<ref>Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., & Tyree, M.T., 1996.

[[Fern]] provides a clear example. Namely, the fern sporangium acts as a catapult. The opening phase is driven by water vaporization and by the resulting pressure decrease inside [[annulus (botany)|annulus]] cells (that is the charging phase of the catapult). When the negative pressure approximately reaches the value of 9 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], cavitation occurs. This rapid event triggers the spore dispersal due to the [[elastic energy]] released by the annulus structure (that is the discharging phase of the catapult). The initial spores acceleration is significantly high (up to <math>\\begin{matrix} 10^5 \\end{matrix}</math> times the [[gravitational acceleration]]).<ref name=\"NoblinRojas2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Noblin|first1=X.|last2=Rojas|first2=N.

Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called \"cavitation\". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.\n\nThe process in which a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]], is called inertial cavitation. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.\n\nSince the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to parts, cavitation is typically an undesirable phenomenon in machinery (although desirable if intentionally used, for example, to sterilize contaminated surgical instruments, break down pollutants in water purification systems, [[emulsify]] tissue for cataract surgery or kidney stone [[lithotripsy]], or [[homogenize]] fluids). It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].\n\n== Physics ==\n\nInertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.\n\nOther ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233\u2013252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}</ref>\n\nInertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.\n\nThe physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}</ref>\n\nIn order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation \"bubbles\" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.\n\nThe vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.\n\n==Hydrodynamic cavitation==\nHydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.\n\nThe process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=STOPAR |first1=DAVID |title=HYDRODYNAMIC CAVITATION |url=https://davidstopar.wixsite.com/home/hydrodynamic-cavitation |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nOrifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChE Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641\u20131648 }}</ref>\n\nThe cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes.

It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.<ref>[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain</ref>\n\nThis is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P.

Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).\n\nCavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].\n\nUse of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}</ref><!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. -->\n\nHydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together.

It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis.\n\n===Cleaning===\nIn industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away in the hope that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned (which is a possibility when the object is immersed, for example in an ultrasonic cleaning bath). The same physical forces that remove contaminants also have the potential to damage the target being cleaned.\n\n=== Food and beverage ===\n\n==== Eggs ====\nCavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==\n[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]\n\nCavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buckland H.

The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].\n\nAlthough the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fujisawa|first=Nobuyuki|last2=Fujita|first2=Yasuaki|last3=Yanagisawa|first3=Keita|last4=Fujisawa|first4=Kei|last5=Yamagata|first5=Takayuki|date=2018-06-01|title=Simultaneous observation of cavitation collapse and shock wave formation in cavitating jet|url=|journal=Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science|volume=94|pages=159\u2013167|doi=10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2018.02.012|issn=0894-1777}}</ref> The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.\n\nAfter a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}</ref>\n\n===Pumps and propellers===\nMajor places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.\n\nAs an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure can become around it. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.\n\nCavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:\n\n====Suction cavitation====\n[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.\n\nCommon causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.\n\n====Discharge cavitation====\nDischarge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.\n\nDischarge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.\n\n====Cavitation solutions====\nSince all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.\n\nTo have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.<ref>[[Pulp & Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes</ref>\nTo overcome cavitation:\nIncrease suction pressure if possible.\nDecrease liquid temperature if possible.\nThrottle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.\nVent gases off the pump casing.\n\n===Control valves===\n\nCavitation can occur in [[control valves]].<ref>[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136</ref>  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.\n\n===Spillways===\nWhen water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.\n\nExperimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between {{cvt|12|and|15|m/s|mph|}}, and, up to flow velocities of {{cvt|20|m/s|mph|||}}, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.<ref name=\"Volkart_Rutschmann_1984\">{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors \u2013 A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.\n\n===Engines===\nSome larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.\n\nIt is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.\n\nFrom about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.\n\n==In nature==\n\n===Geology===\nSome hypotheses{{by who|date=December 2019}}{{examples|date=December 2019}} relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation\u2014namely cavitation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now{{when|date=December 2019}} understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat.

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation.\n\n===Vascular plants===\nCavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.<ref>Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., & Tyree, M.T., 1996.

[[Fern]] provides a clear example. Namely, the fern sporangium acts as a catapult. The opening phase is driven by water vaporization and by the resulting pressure decrease inside [[annulus (botany)|annulus]] cells (that is the charging phase of the catapult). When the negative pressure approximately reaches the value of 9 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], cavitation occurs. This rapid event triggers the spore dispersal due to the [[elastic energy]] released by the annulus structure (that is the discharging phase of the catapult). The initial spores acceleration is significantly high (up to <math>\\begin{matrix} 10^5 \\end{matrix}</math> times the [[gravitational acceleration]]).<ref name=\"NoblinRojas2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Noblin|first1=X.|last2=Rojas|first2=N.

''La Belle'' was wrecked in present-day [[Matagorda Bay]] the following year, dooming La Salle's [[Texas]] colony to failure.  The wreckage of ''La Belle'' lay forgotten until it was discovered by a team of state archaeologists in 1995.  The discovery of La Salle's flagship was regarded as one of the most important archaeological finds of the century in Texas, and a major excavation was launched by the state of Texas that, over a period of about a year, recovered the entire shipwreck and over a million artifacts.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the late 17th century, much of [[North America]] had been claimed by European countries.  [[Spain]] claimed [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], and [[New Spain]] included both today's Mexico and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|much of the southwestern part of the continent]]. The northern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast was [[British colonization of the Americas|claimed by Britain]], and [[New France]] included much of what is now [[Canada]] as well as the [[Illinois Country]].  France feared that their colonies in the center of the continent were vulnerable to potential attacks from their neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]], launched an expedition down the [[Mississippi River]] from New France, expecting to find a path to the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>{{citation |last=Bannon |first=John Francis |title=The Spanish Borderlands Frontier, 1513\u20131821 |publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]] |location=Albuquerque |year=1997 |p=94 |url={{google books|W5HrCZHhs9IC|page=94|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-0-8263-0309-7}}</ref> Instead, La Salle found a route to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The remaining sailors drank wine in place of water, but the alcohol further dehydrated them, and several died.<ref name=bruseth4>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTessier finally decided that the ship must return to Fort Saint Louis for more supplies. As they got underway, a cold front blew in. Since the remaining crewmembers were unskilled, they were unable to keep control of the ship, and because they had lost their second anchor, there was no way to stop the ship from drifting in the wind.  Within a short amount of time, the ''La Belle'' had run aground at the southern end of the bay, approximately a quarter of a mile (400 m) from shore.<ref name=bruseth5>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=5}}</ref>\n\nWhen the storm had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up in the waves, and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others were able to make it safely to shore. Over the next few days they returned to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's papers and clothes, barrels of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the muddy bottom, and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27&nbsp;people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a regular soldier, a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory.  After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort.<ref name=bruseth6>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"chipman77\">{{harvp|Chipman|1992|p=77}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery by the Spanish==\nThe Spanish authorities learned of La Salle's expedition when a former member of the colony, Denis Thomas, was captured aboard a pirate ship. In an attempt to save his life, Thomas related that La Salle had planned to establish a colony near the Mississippi River and eventually take over Spanish silver mines.  Although Thomas was quickly hanged, the Spanish believed his information to be reliable and began searching for the French colony.  On December 25, 1686, a Spanish expedition led by Captain Martin de Rivas and Captain Pedro de Yriarte left [[Veracruz]] to sail along the [[Gulf Coast]].  On April 4, they reached Matagorda Bay and dispatched several canoes to explore the area.  {{convert|3|mi|km}} from their ship, they discovered ''La Belle'', which they described as a \"broken ship\" with three [[fleur-de-lys]] on her stern.<ref name=bruseth8>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish salvaged two swivel guns and five cannons from the ship, as well as the anchor, some cordage, and the masts, which they made into oars.  As final proof that this ship had belonged to the French colony, the expedition also discovered the campsite where the French survivors had lived for three months.  Among the remains of the campsite were pages from books written in French.<ref name=bruseth9>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nThe wreck lay forgotten for over three hundred years in the dark murky waters of Matagorda Bay. In the 1970s, Kathleen Gilmore of [[Southern Methodist University]] analyzed historical accounts of the La Salle shipwrecks, and gave general guidance as to where they might be found.  In 1977, the [[Texas Historical Commission]] (THC) asked an independent researcher to search the archives in Paris for information on the shipwrecks.  She found original copies of maps made by La Salle's engineer, Jean-Baptiste Minet.  Before Minet returned to France aboard the ''Joly'', he had created detailed maps of Matagorda Bay and the pass and had marked the spot where ''L'Aimable'' had sunk. Other researchers discovered additional historical maps, including several that marked ''La Belle's'' resting place.<ref name=bruseth34>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Barto Arnold, the State Marine Archaeologist for the Texas Antiquities Committee (the predecessor to the Texas Historical Commission), proposed a ten-week search for La Salle's ships.  In a [[magnetometer]] survey of the area of the bay deemed a high probability to be ''La Belle's'' location, the expedition found several more recent shipwrecks.  A lack of funding for the next seventeen years stymied further attempts to locate ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth38>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=35\u201338}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1995 the Texas Historical Commission organized a second magnetometer survey to search high-probability areas not included in earlier surveys.  The most important technological development since the original survey was the advent of the differential GPS positioning system, which made navigation and the relocation of targets considerably easier and more accurate.  This survey lasted the entire month and utilized a Geometrics 866 proton precession magnetometer which identified 39 \"magnetic features that required further investigation\".<ref name=bruseth39>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=39}}</ref>  These were prioritized, and on 5 July 1995 divers were sent to the highest priority location.   \n[[File:030331 labelle cannon.jpg|right|thumb|The first of three bronze 4-pounder cannons discovered in the hold of ''La Belle,'' recovered in July 1995. The remaining two guns are pictured below.]]\n[[File:Cannon from La Salle's ship the La Belle.jpg|thumb|One of the three cannons recovered.]]\nDuring the initial diving operations, a prop-wash blower (metal pipe fitted over the propeller to deflect its force down to the seafloor) was used, ostensibly to improve water visibility by forcing surface water down towards the bottom.  It was later decided by the archaeologists that the blower should be turned off as it was visibly damaging the delicate material of the cargo remains.  It is not known exactly how much sediment covered the shipwreck at the time of its discovery because the prop-wash blower was deployed before sending divers down.  The first team of divers reported feeling musket balls on the seafloor along with loose fragments of wood moving in the current created by the blower.  These materials strongly suggested that this was indeed a shipwreck site.  During the second dive, archaeologist [[Chuck Meide]] discovered a bronze cannon which, when subsequently recovered, proved that this shipwreck was indeed that of ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth40>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=40}}</ref> The cannon was ornately decorated, and bore the crest of King Louis and the [[Louis, Count of Vermandois|Count of Vermandois]], the Admiral of France. An illegitimate son of Louis XIV, Vermandois served as Admiral of the French fleet until his death in 1683, meaning the cannon would have been cast no later than 1683, the time when La Salle was preparing for his voyage.  This was considered strong circumstantial evidence that the ship was ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth46>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=46}}</ref>  A serial number on the gun (and two others found in 1997) was later matched in a French archival record discovered by Dr. John de Bry with the numbers of four bronze cannons that had been loaded onto ''La Belle'', providing definitive proof of the wreck's identity.\n\nThe shipwreck may have been known to one or more local watermen before its discovery by archaeologists.  During the 1996 excavations, Texas Historical Commission archaeologists observed direct evidence that one of the four bronze cannons known to have been on ''La Belle'' had been removed from the wreckage some time before the 1995 discovery of the wreck, possibly decades earlier.  It was surmised that this may have been the action of a local shrimper who may have accidentally snagged and recovered the gun in his nets.  The whereabouts of this cannon remain a mystery, and no other clear signs of prior artifact recovery were observed at the wreck site.\n\n==Archaeological excavation==\n[[File:030331 labelle excavation.jpg|left|thumb|The cofferdam built around ''La Belle'']]\nThe team of state archaeologists spent one month diving on the wreckage, documenting its extent and condition, and recovering a number of artifacts.  Because of the historical significance of the wreck, and because of the dark waters of the Bay which severely limited visibility for divers, the decision was made to construct a [[cofferdam]] around the wreck site.  This was a double-walled steel structure, with compacted sand between the two walls, surrounding the entire wreck.  The 1.5 million dollar structure was paid for by the state of Texas, though private funding and federal grants would fund much of the subsequent excavation.  After completion in September 1996, the water inside the cofferdam was pumped out and the ship was exposed to air for the first time in centuries.\n[[File:Belle bronze cannon.jpg|right|thumb|Bronze cannon and other artifacts exposed in the lowermost part of the hull remains as seen during the final stages of excavation in February 1997.]]\nA much larger team of archaeologists, numbering around 20, had been assembled in the nearby town of [[Palacios, Texas|Palacios]] and were charged with the complete excavation of the shipwreck, under the direction of Dr. Jim Bruseth.  This endeavor lasted from July 1996 to May 1997, and was considered one of the most significant maritime archaeological excavations of its time.  As the muddy sediments were carefully removed from the wreckage, many wooden boxes and casks were exposed loaded with a wide variety of artifacts. ''La Belle'' had contained all of the salvaged supplies from La Salle's wrecked storeship (''L'Amiable'') and thus offered a unique insight into the supplies deemed necessary for a successful colonization venture.  As this was considered enemy territory by the French (Texas was claimed by their Spanish rivals) and local Indians proved hostile, there was a wide array of weapons on board the vessel, including three bronze cannons, one iron [[swivel gun]], several boxes of muskets, many casks of lead shot and gunpowder, a handful of ceramic firepots (used like hand grenades), and several sword handles.  There were also numerous trade goods, including hundreds of thousands of blue, white, and black glass beads, brass finger rings with Catholic religious symbols, brass pins, brass hawk bells, wooden combs, and a barrel of iron axe heads.  Tools and supplies such as smelting crucibles, a cooper's plane, a shovel, rope, and long bars of iron stock were also recovered, as were a wide variety of ship's hardware and rigging components.  Faunal remains included the remains of salt pork, skeletons of rats, and the trophy skulls of deer, complete with antlers.  One complete human skeleton was discovered, that of a middle-aged male with signs of arthritis.  Part of this individual's brain was intact, preserved by the anaerobic environment caused by the thick muddy sediments at the bottom of the bay.  After [[osteology|osteological]] analysis, these human remains were buried at the [[Texas State Cemetery]].\n\nAll of the artifacts were removed from the hull by the start of March 1997.  From that point on, the archaeologists concentrated on the remains of the ship itself.  The entire ship was disassembled, each timber being carefully recorded before and after its removal from the hull remains.  Fieldwork was completed by May 1997, after which the cofferdam was disassembled and sold.  The recovered timbers were eventually reassembled in a special cradle and vat designed at [[Texas A&M University]]'s Nautical Archaeology Program, the institution in charge of the conservation of all the artifacts recovered from the shipwreck site after 1995.  The hull was treated by long-term soaking in [[polyethylene glycol]] and freeze-drying, a process which took over ten years.\n\n==Exhibit==\n[[File:Stereo pair of reconstruction of La Belle (1684).JPG|left|thumb|Stereoscopic view from the stern of the hull of ''La Belle'' undergoing reassembly in Austin, December 2014]]In October 2014 the ''La Belle: The Ship That Changed History'' exhibit officially opened.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Belle exhibit opens at Bullock Museum|url=http://kxan.com/2014/10/25/labelle-exhibit-opens-at-bullock-museum/|accessdate=14 March 2016|agency=KXAN|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> The hull of the ship and many of the recovered artifacts, including colored glass beads, brass pots, a colander, a ladle, muskets, powder horns, an early explosive device called a fire pot and a bronze cannon with lifting handles shaped like dolphins, are on display at the [[Bullock Texas State History Museum]] in the state capital of Austin.<ref name=StoryOfTX>{{cite web|title=La Belle: The Ship That Changed History|url=http://www.thestoryoftexas.com/la-belle/the-exhibit|website=thestoryoftexas.com|publisher=Bullock Museum|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> Many more artifacts can be seen in the multi-location La Salle Odyssey exhibit, located in museums around Texas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The LaSalle Odyssey|url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/public/upload/publications/Odyssey.pdf|website=thc.state.tx.us|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>  The Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History is the official repository of artifacts.<ref name=corpus1>{{cite web |title=Shipwrecks |website=Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History |url=https://www.ccmuseum.com/explore/exhibits-2/#fb-content-5 |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref> The [[Museum of the Coastal Bend]] in [[Victoria, Texas]] also has many artifacts from the ''La Belle'', mainly the other seven cannons from Fort St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where Texas History Began |website=Museum of the Coastal Bend |url=http://www.museumofthecoastalbend.org/exhibits |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|January 2015}}, a live stream of the build of ''La Belle'' is broadcast from the [[Bullock Museum]] on Wednesday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time.<ref name=StoryOfTX/>\n\n==Ownership==\n\nAfter the excavation was completed, the French government filed an official claim for the ship and its contents.  Under international naval laws, an official naval vessel is owned by the country for which the ship flies its flag.  Despite a long-standing tradition repeated by American historians that ''La Belle'' was a personal gift from the King to La Salle, no documentary evidence confirming this claim could be produced.  Instead, archival research conducted in French depositories provided two official documents which listed ''La Belle'' as being owned by the King but loaned to La Salle.  [[Madeleine Albright]] conceded the claim in favor of France just before the end of the [[Bill  Clinton|Clinton administration]].  After a several-year negotiation, an agreement was signed on March 31, 2003 which gives official title to the wreck and its artifacts to the [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] in Paris.  Day-to-day control was granted to the Texas Historical Commission for 99 years.<ref name=bruseth72>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=72}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* French Ancre Publishing Compagny published a Monography with a full set of plans for this ship - scaled in 1/48 for [[model building]]. {{ISBN|2903178283}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnOKAAAACAAJ |title=Raising La Belle |publisher=Eakin Press |location=Austin |first=Mark G. |last=Mitchell |year=2001  |isbn=978-1-5716-8703-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Weddle |first=Robert S. |title=The Wreck of the Belle, the Ruin of La Salle |series=Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Volume 88 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58544-121-1}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|La Belle (ship, 1684)}}\n* [http://www.thc.state.tx.us/lasalle/lasbelle.shtml Texas Historical Commission La Salle Shipwreck Project]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050316040730/http://www.caller2.com/newsarch/lasalle1.htm ''Raising the Belle'' by Dan Parker]\n* [http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2005/10/author-interview-mark-g-mitchell-on.html Interview with Mark Mitchell, author of 'Raising La Belle']\n* [http://ccmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/38892cgi/mweb.exe?request=clicksearch;dtype=d;subset=0;_t1101=la%20belle%20shipwreck%20collection Artifacts from the La Belle Shipwreck Collection at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History]\n* [http://www.thestoryoftexas.com/la-belle Live stream of the build, Bullock Museum, La Belle, the ship that changed history exhibit]\n\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n{{Underwater diving|prodiv}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|28.4481|N|96.3222|W|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Texas]]\n[[Category:French Texas]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1686]]\n[[Category:Matagorda County, Texas]]\n[[Category:Age of Sail ships of France]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|One of Robert de La Salle's four ships when he explored the Gulf of Mexico}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image= Belle hull.jpg\n|Ship image size = 300px\n|Ship caption=The excavated hull remains of ''La Belle''\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=France\n|Ship flag=[[File:Flag of the Kingdom of France (1814-1830).svg|60px]]\n|Ship name=La Belle\n|Ship namesake=\n|Ship owner=[[Louis XIV]]\n|Ship operator=[[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]]\n|Ship registry=\n|Ship route=\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship awarded=\n|Ship builder=Honor\u00e9 Mallet\n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship yard number=\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=\n|Ship sponsor=\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship completed=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship recommissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=\n|Ship maiden voyage= \n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship renamed=\n|Ship reclassified=\n|Ship refit=\n|Ship struck=\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship homeport=\n|Ship identification=\n|Ship motto=\n|Ship nickname=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship honors=\n|Ship captured=\n|Ship fate=shipwrecked\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n|Ship badge=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship type=barque longue\n|Ship tonnage=40\u201345\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship tons burthen=\n|Ship length={{convert|54|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship beam={{convert|14|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft={{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship depth=\n|Ship hold depth=\n|Ship decks=\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship ramps=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=\n|Ship endurance=\n|Ship test depth=\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship capacity=\n|Ship troops=\n|Ship complement=\n|Ship crew=\n|Ship time to activate=\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=\n|Ship armour=\n|Ship armor=\n|Ship aircraft=\n|Ship aircraft facilities=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n\n'''''La Belle''''' was one of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de La Salle's]] four ships when he explored the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the ill-fated mission of starting a French colony at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] in 1685.  ''La Belle'' was wrecked in present-day [[Matagorda Bay]] the following year, dooming La Salle's [[Texas]] colony to failure.  The wreckage of ''La Belle'' lay forgotten until it was discovered by a team of state archaeologists in 1995.  The discovery of La Salle's flagship was regarded as one of the most important archaeological finds of the century in Texas, and a major excavation was launched by the state of Texas that, over a period of about a year, recovered the entire shipwreck and over a million artifacts.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the late 17th century, much of [[North America]] had been claimed by European countries.  [[Spain]] claimed [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], and [[New Spain]] included both today's Mexico and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|much of the southwestern part of the continent]]. The northern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast was [[British colonization of the Americas|claimed by Britain]], and [[New France]] included much of what is now [[Canada]] as well as the [[Illinois Country]].  France feared that their territory in the center of the continent was vulnerable to the expansionist plans of their neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]], launched an expedition down the [[Mississippi River]] from New France, expecting to find a path to the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>{{citation |last=Bannon |first=John Francis |title=The Spanish Borderlands Frontier, 1513\u20131821 |publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]] |location=Albuquerque |year=1997 |p=94 |url={{google books|W5HrCZHhs9IC|page=94|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-0-8263-0309-7}}</ref> Instead, La Salle found a route to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

At the end of October La Salle decided to undertake a longer expedition and reloaded the ''La Belle'' with much of the remaining supplies.<ref name=weddle29/> He took 50&nbsp;men, plus the ''La Belle's'' crew of 27&nbsp;sailors, leaving behind 34 men, women, and children. The bulk of the men traveled with La Salle in canoes, while the ''La Belle'' followed further off the coast.<ref name=\"weddle29\">{{harvp|Weddle|1991|p=29}}</ref> Several of the men, including the captain of the ''La Belle'', Canil Maraud, died on this expedition from eating [[opuntia|prickly pear]].

La Salle took 20&nbsp;men with him to travel overland to reach the Mississippi, leaving Pierre Tessier, the former second in command of the ''La Belle'', in charge of the ship.<ref name=bruseth3/> After three&nbsp;months of searching overland, La Salle's group returned, but were unable to find the ''La Belle'' where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.<ref name=\"weddle30\"/><ref name=\"chipman83\">{{harvp|Chipman|1992|p=83}}</ref>\n\n===Loss===\nWhile La Salle was gone, the ship began to run low of drinking water. Tessier sent the five best sailors ashore in the ''La Belle''{{'}}s only longboat to search for water. The men were seen struggling against a strong wind to return to the ship as night fell, and were presumed lost when the longboat never arrived at the ship. The remaining sailors drank wine in place of water, but the alcohol further dehydrated them, and several died.<ref name=bruseth4>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTessier finally decided that the ship must return to Fort Saint Louis for more supplies. As they got underway, a cold front blew in. Since the remaining crewmembers were unskilled, they were unable to keep control of the ship, and because they had lost their second anchor, there was no way to stop the ship from drifting in the wind.  Within a short amount of time, the ''La Belle'' had run aground at the southern end of the bay, approximately a quarter of a mile (400 m) from shore.<ref name=bruseth5>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=5}}</ref>\n\nWhen the storm had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up in the waves, and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others were able to make it safely to shore. Over the next few days they returned to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's papers and clothes, barrels of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the muddy bottom, and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27&nbsp;people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a regular soldier, a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory.  After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort.<ref name=bruseth6>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"chipman77\">{{harvp|Chipman|1992|p=77}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery by the Spanish==\nThe Spanish authorities learned of La Salle's expedition when a former member of the colony, Denis Thomas, was captured aboard a pirate ship. In an attempt to save his life, Thomas related that La Salle had planned to establish a colony near the Mississippi River and eventually take over Spanish silver mines.  Although Thomas was quickly hanged, the Spanish believed his information to be reliable and began searching for the French colony.  On December 25, 1686, a Spanish expedition led by Captain Martin de Rivas and Captain Pedro de Yriarte left [[Veracruz]] to sail along the [[Gulf Coast]].  On April 4, they reached Matagorda Bay and dispatched several canoes to explore the area.  {{convert|3|mi|km}} from their ship, they discovered ''La Belle'', which they described as a \"broken ship\" with three [[fleur-de-lys]] on her stern.<ref name=bruseth8>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish salvaged two swivel guns and five cannons from the ship, as well as the anchor, some cordage, and the masts, which they made into oars.  As final proof that this ship had belonged to the French colony, the expedition also discovered the campsite where the French survivors had lived for three months.  Among the remains of the campsite were pages from books written in French.<ref name=bruseth9>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nThe wreck lay forgotten for over three hundred years in the dark murky waters of Matagorda Bay. In the 1970s, Kathleen Gilmore of [[Southern Methodist University]] analyzed historical accounts of the La Salle shipwrecks, and gave general guidance as to where they might be found.  In 1977, the [[Texas Historical Commission]] (THC) asked an independent researcher to search the archives in Paris for information on the shipwrecks.  She found original copies of maps made by La Salle's engineer, Jean-Baptiste Minet.  Before Minet returned to France aboard the ''Joly'', he had created detailed maps of Matagorda Bay and the pass and had marked the spot where ''L'Aimable'' had sunk. Other researchers discovered additional historical maps, including several that marked ''La Belle's'' resting place.<ref name=bruseth34>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Barto Arnold, the State Marine Archaeologist for the Texas Antiquities Committee (the predecessor to the Texas Historical Commission), proposed a ten-week search for La Salle's ships.  In a [[magnetometer]] survey of the area of the bay deemed a high probability to be ''La Belle's'' location, the expedition found several more recent shipwrecks.  A lack of funding for the next seventeen years stymied further attempts to locate ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth38>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|pp=35\u201338}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1995 the Texas Historical Commission organized a second magnetometer survey to search high-probability areas not included in earlier surveys.  The most important technological development since the original survey was the advent of the differential GPS positioning system, which made navigation and the relocation of targets considerably easier and more accurate.  This survey lasted the entire month and utilized a Geometrics 866 proton precession magnetometer which identified 39 \"magnetic features that required further investigation\".<ref name=bruseth39>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=39}}</ref>  These were prioritized, and on 5 July 1995 divers were sent to the highest priority location.   \n[[File:030331 labelle cannon.jpg|right|thumb|The first of three bronze 4-pounder cannons discovered in the hold of ''La Belle,'' recovered in July 1995. The remaining two guns are pictured below.]]\n[[File:Cannon from La Salle's ship the La Belle.jpg|thumb|One of the three cannons recovered.]]\nDuring the initial diving operations, a prop-wash blower (metal pipe fitted over the propeller to deflect its force down to the seafloor) was used, ostensibly to improve water visibility by forcing surface water down towards the bottom.  It was later decided by the archaeologists that the blower should be turned off as it was visibly damaging the delicate material of the cargo remains.  It is not known exactly how much sediment covered the shipwreck at the time of its discovery because the prop-wash blower was deployed before sending divers down.  The first team of divers reported feeling musket balls on the seafloor along with loose fragments of wood moving in the current created by the blower.  These materials strongly suggested that this was indeed a shipwreck site.  During the second dive, archaeologist [[Chuck Meide]] discovered a bronze cannon which, when subsequently recovered, proved that this shipwreck was indeed that of ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth40>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=40}}</ref> The cannon was ornately decorated, and bore the crest of King Louis and the [[Louis, Count of Vermandois|Count of Vermandois]], the Admiral of France. An illegitimate son of Louis XIV, Vermandois served as Admiral of the French fleet until his death in 1683, meaning the cannon would have been cast no later than 1683, the time when La Salle was preparing for his voyage.  This was considered strong circumstantial evidence that the ship was ''La Belle''.<ref name=bruseth46>{{harvp|Bruseth|Turner|2005|p=46}}</ref>  A serial number on the gun (and two others found in 1997) was later matched in a French archival record discovered by Dr. John de Bry with the numbers of four bronze cannons that had been loaded onto ''La Belle'', providing definitive proof of the wreck's identity.\n\nThe shipwreck may have been known to one or more local watermen before its discovery by archaeologists.  During the 1996 excavations, Texas Historical Commission archaeologists observed direct evidence that one of the four bronze cannons known to have been on ''La Belle'' had been removed from the wreckage some time before the 1995 discovery of the wreck, possibly decades earlier.  It was surmised that this may have been the action of a local shrimper who may have accidentally snagged and recovered the gun in his nets.  The whereabouts of this cannon remain a mystery, and no other clear signs of prior artifact recovery were observed at the wreck site.\n\n==Archaeological excavation==\n[[File:030331 labelle excavation.jpg|left|thumb|The cofferdam built around ''La Belle'']]\nThe team of state archaeologists spent one month diving on the wreckage, documenting its extent and condition, and recovering a number of artifacts.  Because of the historical significance of the wreck, and because of the dark waters of the Bay which severely limited visibility for divers, the decision was made to construct a [[cofferdam]] around the wreck site.  This was a double-walled steel structure, with compacted sand between the two walls, surrounding the entire wreck.  The 1.5 million dollar structure was paid for by the state of Texas, though private funding and federal grants would fund much of the subsequent excavation.  After completion in September 1996, the water inside the cofferdam was pumped out and the ship was exposed to air for the first time in centuries.\n[[File:Belle bronze cannon.jpg|right|thumb|Bronze cannon and other artifacts exposed in the lowermost part of the hull remains as seen during the final stages of excavation in February 1997.]]\nA much larger team of archaeologists, numbering around 20, had been assembled in the nearby town of [[Palacios, Texas|Palacios]] and were charged with the complete excavation of the shipwreck, under the direction of Dr. Jim Bruseth.  This endeavor lasted from July 1996 to May 1997, and was considered one of the most significant maritime archaeological excavations of its time.  As the muddy sediments were carefully removed from the wreckage, many wooden boxes and casks were exposed loaded with a wide variety of artifacts. ''La Belle'' had contained all of the salvaged supplies from La Salle's wrecked storeship (''L'Amiable'') and thus offered a unique insight into the supplies deemed necessary for a successful colonization venture.  As this was considered enemy territory by the French (Texas was claimed by their Spanish rivals) and local Indians proved hostile, there was a wide array of weapons on board the vessel, including three bronze cannons, one iron [[swivel gun]], several boxes of muskets, many casks of lead shot and gunpowder, a handful of ceramic firepots (used like hand grenades), and several sword handles.  There were also numerous trade goods, including hundreds of thousands of blue, white, and black glass beads, brass finger rings with Catholic religious symbols, brass pins, brass hawk bells, wooden combs, and a barrel of iron axe heads.  Tools and supplies such as smelting crucibles, a cooper's plane, a shovel, rope, and long bars of iron stock were also recovered, as were a wide variety of ship's hardware and rigging components.  Faunal remains included the remains of salt pork, skeletons of rats, and the trophy skulls of deer, complete with antlers.  One complete human skeleton was discovered, that of a middle-aged male with signs of arthritis.  Part of this individual's brain was intact, preserved by the anaerobic environment caused by the thick muddy sediments at the bottom of the bay.  After [[osteology|osteological]] analysis, these human remains were buried at the [[Texas State Cemetery]].\n\nAll of the artifacts were removed from the hull by the start of March 1997.  From that point on, the archaeologists concentrated on the remains of the ship itself.  The entire ship was disassembled, each timber being carefully recorded before and after its removal from the hull remains.  Fieldwork was completed by May 1997, after which the cofferdam was disassembled and sold.  The recovered timbers were eventually reassembled in a special cradle and vat designed at [[Texas A&M University]]'s Nautical Archaeology Program, the institution in charge of the conservation of all the artifacts recovered from the shipwreck site after 1995.  The hull was treated by long-term soaking in [[polyethylene glycol]] and freeze-drying, a process which took over ten years.\n\n==Exhibit==\n[[File:Stereo pair of reconstruction of La Belle (1684).JPG|left|thumb|Stereoscopic view from the stern of the hull of ''La Belle'' undergoing reassembly in Austin, December 2014]]In October 2014 the ''La Belle: The Ship That Changed History'' exhibit officially opened.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Belle exhibit opens at Bullock Museum|url=http://kxan.com/2014/10/25/labelle-exhibit-opens-at-bullock-museum/|accessdate=14 March 2016|agency=KXAN|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> The hull of the ship and many of the recovered artifacts, including colored glass beads, brass pots, a colander, a ladle, muskets, powder horns, an early explosive device called a fire pot and a bronze cannon with lifting handles shaped like dolphins, are on display at the [[Bullock Texas State History Museum]] in the state capital of Austin.<ref name=StoryOfTX>{{cite web|title=La Belle: The Ship That Changed History|url=http://www.thestoryoftexas.com/la-belle/the-exhibit|website=thestoryoftexas.com|publisher=Bullock Museum|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> Many more artifacts can be seen in the multi-location La Salle Odyssey exhibit, located in museums around Texas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The LaSalle Odyssey|url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/public/upload/publications/Odyssey.pdf|website=thc.state.tx.us|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>  The Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History is the official repository of artifacts.<ref name=corpus1>{{cite web |title=Shipwrecks |website=Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History |url=https://www.ccmuseum.com/explore/exhibits-2/#fb-content-5 |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref> The [[Museum of the Coastal Bend]] in [[Victoria, Texas]] also has many artifacts from the ''La Belle'', mainly the other seven cannons from Fort St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where Texas History Began |website=Museum of the Coastal Bend |url=http://www.museumofthecoastalbend.org/exhibits |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|January 2015}}, a live stream of the build of ''La Belle'' is broadcast from the [[Bullock Museum]] on Wednesday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time.<ref name=StoryOfTX/>\n\n==Ownership==\n\nAfter the excavation was completed, the French government filed an official claim for the ship and its contents.  Under international naval laws, an official naval vessel is owned by the country for which the ship flies its flag.  Despite a long-standing tradition repeated by American historians that ''La Belle'' was a personal gift from the King to La Salle, no documentary evidence confirming this claim could be produced.  Instead, archival research conducted in French depositories provided two official documents which listed ''La Belle'' as being owned by the King but loaned to La Salle.  [[Madeleine Albright]] conceded the claim in favor of France just before the end of the [[Bill  Clinton|Clinton administration]].  After a several-year negotiation, an agreement was signed on March 31, 2003 which gives official title to the wreck and its artifacts to the [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] in Paris.

It was first performed in 1977. The play criticises the Soviet practice of treating political dissidence as a form of mental illness.<ref name=\"Billington\">{{cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|title=Every Good Boy Deserves Favour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/19/review-every-good-boy-deserves-favour|accessdate=19 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 January 2009}}</ref> Its title derives from the popular [[mnemonic]] used by music students to remember the notes on the lines of the [[treble clef]]. The cast comprises six actors, but also a full orchestra, which not only provides music throughout the play but also forms an essential part of the action.

Alexander receives visits from the Doctor and from a Colonel in the [[KGB]].\n\nMeanwhile, his son, Sacha, is seen in a school classroom with a teacher who attempts to convince him of the genuineness of his father's illness.\n\n==Production history==\nBecause of the difficulties in staging a play that requires a full orchestra in addition to the cast of actors, the play is rarely performed.\n\nIts 1977 premiere was staged at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London as part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]]. That performance featured [[Ian McKellen]] (Alexander), [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] (Ivanov) and [[Patrick Stewart]] (Doctor), as well as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Previn.  The play was then commercially recorded for RCA Red Seal (RCA ABL1-2855), with Previn conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and McKellen, Stewart, [[Ian Richardson]], Elizabeth Spriggs, Andrew Sheldon, and Philip Locke as the featured actors.\n\nIn 1978, the play was produced for television by the [[BBC]]. The producer was [[Mark Shivas]] and direction was shared by [[Trevor Nunn]] and Roger Bamford. The filming was undertaken at a live performance at [[Wembley Conference Centre]] in April 1978, conducted by Previn. The cast for this production was Ian McKellen (Alexander Ivanov), [[Ben Kingsley]] (Ivanov), [[Frank Windsor]] (Doctor), [[John Woodvine]] (Colonel), [[Barbara Leigh Hunt]] (Teacher), and James Harris (aka Jim Harris) and James Pickering as Sacha.\n\nFollowing its BBC production, the play ran at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London during the summer and autumn of 1978. Cast changes included [[John Carlisle (actor)|John Carlisle]] taking on the role of the Colonel from John Woodvine, who played Alexander Ivanov, [[Ian McDiarmid]] (Ivanov), [[Rowena Cooper]] (Teacher) and [Rhys McConochie (Doctor).

The cast comprises six actors, but also a full orchestra, which not only provides music throughout the play but also forms an essential part of the action.

Alexander receives visits from the Doctor and from a Colonel in the [[KGB]].\n\nMeanwhile, his son, Sacha, is seen in a school classroom with a teacher who attempts to convince him of the genuineness of his father's illness.\n\n==Production history==\nBecause of the difficulties in staging a play that requires a full orchestra in addition to the cast of actors, the play is rarely performed.\n\nIts 1977 premiere was staged at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London as part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]]. That performance featured [[Ian McKellen]] (Alexander), [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] (Ivanov) and [[Patrick Stewart]] (Doctor), as well as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Previn.  The play was then commercially recorded for RCA Red Seal (RCA ABL1-2855), with Previn conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and McKellen, Stewart, [[Ian Richardson]], Elizabeth Spriggs, Andrew Sheldon, and Philip Locke as the featured actors.\n\nIn 1978, the play was produced for television by the [[BBC]]. The producer was [[Mark Shivas]] and direction was shared by [[Trevor Nunn]] and Roger Bamford. The filming was undertaken at a live performance at [[Wembley Conference Centre]] in April 1978, conducted by Previn. The cast for this production was Ian McKellen (Alexander Ivanov), [[Ben Kingsley]] (Ivanov), [[Frank Windsor]] (Doctor), [[John Woodvine]] (Colonel), [[Barbara Leigh Hunt]] (Teacher), and James Harris (aka Jim Harris) and James Pickering as Sacha.\n\nFollowing its BBC production, the play ran at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London during the summer and autumn of 1978. Cast changes included [[John Carlisle (actor)|John Carlisle]] taking on the role of the Colonel from John Woodvine, who played Alexander Ivanov, [[Ian McDiarmid]] (Ivanov), [[Rowena Cooper]] (Teacher) and [Rhys McConochie (Doctor). The role of Sacha was played by a number of young actors including Harris again, and Anthony Robb. ''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' was the last production at the old Mermaid before it was demolished and redeveloped.\n\nIn July and August 1979, the play was given a New York City run of eight performances at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] House, with a cast featuring [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] (Ivanov), [[Eli Wallach]] (Alexander), Carol Teitel (Teacher), Remak Ramsay (Doctor), Bobby Scott (Sacha), and Carl Low (Colonel Rozinsky).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/31/archives/theater-stoppards-every-good-boy-madmans-will.html | title=Theater: Stoppard's Every Good Boy | work=New York Times | author=Mel Gussow | date=1979-07-31 | accessdate=2017-05-29}}</ref>\n\nPatrick Stewart directed and appeared in a 1992 production (produced by [[Charles Johanson]] for the Orange County Symphony) which toured to four US cities.

This positioned Malay (later Indonesian) to become the official language of the archipelago after independence. Compared to other colonial powers the Netherlands seldom used taught Dutch outside of official circles, although there was an increase in Dutch usage after the [[Batavian Republic]] formed the [[Dutch East Indies]] in 1779 when the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt. \n\n===Europe===\nAlthough writings existed in many of Europe's languages in the post-classical period, the invention of the printing press which helped to launch the [[Protestant Reformation]] quickly expanded the written form of European languages. For example, previously sparse Uralic languages became well documented. [[History_of_the_Hungarian_language#Middle_Hungarian|Middle Hungarian]] appeared in a printed book for the first time in 1533, published in Krak\u00f3w.

This positioned Malay (later Indonesian) to become the official language of the archipelago after independence. Compared to other colonial powers the Netherlands seldom used taught Dutch outside of official circles, although there was an increase in Dutch usage after the [[Batavian Republic]] formed the [[Dutch East Indies]] in 1779 when the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt. \n\n===Europe===\nAlthough writings existed in many of Europe's languages in the post-classical period, the invention of the printing press which helped to launch the [[Protestant Reformation]] quickly expanded the written form of European languages. For example, previously sparse Uralic languages became well documented. [[History_of_the_Hungarian_language#Middle_Hungarian|Middle Hungarian]] appeared in a printed book for the first time in 1533, published in Krak\u00f3w.

In the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and German Empire, German was a high status language spoken by upper middle classes and settlers in large parts of current day Poland, Slovakia, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. \n\n[[File:German1910.png|thumb|Extent of German language speakers in 1910]]\nThe expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe led to a rapid contraction the [[German Sprachraum]], although not a significant erosion of the language.

For example, Nahuatl plummeted from 5% of the population in 1895 to 1.49% in 2000. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in-part forced new recognition of indigenous languages in the late 1990s, with the creation of the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] (CDI) and the [[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Ind\u00edgenas]] (INALI), as well as offering bilingual education. <ref>{{Cite web|author=INALI [Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Ind\u00edgenas] |year=n.d. |title=Presentaci\u00f3n de la Ley General de Derechos Ling\u00fc\u00edsticos |url= http://www.inali.gob.mx/ind-leyes.html |work =Difusi\u00f3n de INALI|publisher=INALI, [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica]]archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317120048/http://www.inali.gob.mx/ind-leyes.html |archivedate = 17 March 2008|url-status=dead|language=es}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to losses of regional languages throughout much of North America, the Quebec nationalist movement pushed back in the late 1960s and Canada adopted national bilingualism in 1982. The Charter of French Language in 1977 established French as the sole language of government and education in the Quebec. The number of English speakers in the province, which began declining in the 1960s had dropped by 180,000 since the 1970s in the 2006 census. <ref name=\"collectiverightsquebec\">Richard Y.

In the Atacama Desert in Chile, the last speaker of [[Kunza]] language isolate was found in 1949, with the final shift to Spanish completed at some point in the 1950s. The [[Ona language]] spoken by [[Selk'nam people]] in Tierra del Fuego went extinct around the early 1980s, although some sources suggest a handful of speakers still existed around 2014. <ref name=Adelaar>Adelaar, Willem (2010). \"South America\".

Political disruptions changed language use in some areas, with the abandonment of Russian as a second language in some parts of Eastern Europe.\n\nDue to high levels of [[crime in South Africa]], large numbers of Afrikaans speakers emigrated to Australia, Canada, the US and UK throughout the late 1990s and early 21st century. In spite of the loss of state support for the language after the end of apartheid, it remains the second mostly widely spoken language in South Africa, with a growing majority among [[Coloured]] people.

American linguist and author [[John McWhorter]] projects that by the early 2100s only 600 to 700 languages will be in widespread daily use, with English remaining as the dominant world language. He imagined a scenario in which languages become more streamlined and blended, giving the examples of \"Singlish\" in Singapore, Wolof in Senegal, Kiezdeutsch in Germany and \"Kebob Norsk\" in Norway. <ref>{{cite article |author=McWhorter, John H. |year=January 2, 2015|title=What the World Will Speak in 2115|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nOthers argue that English will become only one of several major world languages with an increase in bi-lingualism, given evidence that the number of native speakers of the language is falling. In 2004, consultant and linguistics researcher David Graddol suggested that native English speakers will fall from nine percent to five percent of all language speakers by 2050, with Mandarin Chinese and Hindi-Urdu rising up the list. <ref>{{cite article|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4387421/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/english-wont-dominate-world-language/#.XfR5nkd7nIU|title=English won't dominate as world language|date=February 26, 2004|author=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\nIn a widely debated assessment, the French investment bank [[Natixis]] proposed that French would become the world's most spoken language by 2050, with 750 million speakers in sub-Saharan Africa. <ref>{{cite article|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/03/21/want-to-know-the-language-of-the-future-the-data-suggests-it-could-be-french/#60305edf6d58|title=Want To Know The Language Of The Future?
