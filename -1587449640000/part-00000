The Poor Clares were the second [[Franciscan]] branch of the order to be established. Founded by saints [[Clare of Assisi]] and [[Francis of Assisi]] on [[Palm Sunday]] in the year 1212, they were organized after the [[Order of Friars Minor]] (the ''first Order''), and before the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] for the laity. As of 2011 there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poorclare.org/|title=Poor Clare Sisters|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Poor Clares follow the ''[[Rule of St. Clare]]'', which was approved by Pope [[Innocent IV]] the day before Clare's death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (O.S.C.) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique [[Constitutions]], are the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.) (founded 1410), the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap) (founded 1538) and the [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration]] (P.C.P.A.) (founded 1854).\n<!--Note, the lead section was copied to [[Franciscans]] version 761246405-->\n\n==Foundation and rule==\nThe Poor Clares were founded by [[Clare of Assisi]] in the year 1212. Little is known of Clare's early life, although popular tradition hints that she came from a fairly well-to-do family in [[Assisi]]. At the age of eighteen, inspired by the preaching of [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]] in the [[Assisi Cathedral|cathedral]], Clare ran away from home to join his community of friars at the [[Porziuncola|Portiuncula]], some way outside the town.<ref>Michael Walsh (ed.). ''Butler's lives of the Saints'', Burns and Oates (1991) p. 246.</ref> Although, according to tradition, her family wanted to take her back by force, Clare's dedication to holiness and poverty inspired the friars to accept her resolution. She was given the [[religious habit|habit]] of a nun and transferred to [[Benedictine]] monasteries, first at Bastia and then at Sant' Angelo di Panzo, for her monastic formation.\n\nBy 1216 Francis was able to offer Clare and her companions a monastery adjoining the chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]] where she became [[abbess]]. Clare's mother, two of her sisters and some other wealthy women from [[Florence]] soon joined her new Order. Clare dedicated her order to the strict principles of Francis, setting a rule of extreme poverty far more severe than that of any female order of the time.<ref name=\"Farmer, David 1997 p. 103\">Farmer, David (ed.) ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Oxford University Press (1997), p. 103</ref> Clare's determination that her order not be wealthy or own property, and that the nuns live entirely from alms given by local people, was initially protected by the papal bull ''Privilegium paupertatis'', issued by [[Pope Innocent III]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12251b.htm| title = Poor Clares |publisher = The Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent|accessdate = 10 November 2009}}</ref> By this time the order had grown to number three monasteries.\n\n==Spread of the order==\nThe movement quickly spread, though in a somewhat disorganized fashion, with several monasteries of women devoted to the Franciscan ideal springing up elsewhere in Northern Italy. At this point Ugolino, Cardinal Bishop of [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]] (the future [[Pope Gregory IX]]), was given the task of overseeing all such monasteries and preparing a formal [[monastic Rule|rule]]. Although monasteries at [[Monticello]], [[Perugia]], [[Siena]], Gattajola and elsewhere adopted the new Rule \u2013 which allowed for property to be held in trust by the papacy for the various communities \u2013 it was not adopted by Clare herself or her monastery at San Damiano.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Ugolino's Rule, originally based on the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] one, was amended in 1263 by Pope Urban IV to allow for the communal ownership of property, and was adopted by a growing number of monasteries across [[Europe]]. Communities adopting this less rigorous rule came to be known as the Order of Saint Clare (O.S.C.) or the Urbanist Poor Clares.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2007, Vol.9. p. 603</ref>\n\nClare herself resisted the Ugolino Rule, since it did not closely enough follow the ideal of complete poverty advocated by Francis. On 9 August 1253, she managed to obtain a [[papal bull]], ''Solet annuere'', establishing a rule of her own, more closely following that of the friars, which forbade the possession of property either individually or as a community. Originally applying only to Clare's community at San Damiano, this rule was also adopted by many monasteries.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Communities that followed this stricter rule were fewer in number than the followers of the rule formulated by Cardinal Ugolino, and became known simply as \"Poor Clares\" (P.C.) or Primitives.\n\nThe situation was further complicated a century later when [[Saint Colette]] of [[Corbie]] restored the primitive rule of strict poverty to 17 French monasteries. Her followers came to be called the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.). Two further branches, the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap.) and the [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarines]], also followed the strict observance.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\"/> The later group disappeared as a distinct group when their observance among the friars was ended, with the friars being merged by the [[Holy See]] into the wider observant branch of the First Order.\n\nThe spread of the order began in 1218 when a monastery was founded in [[Perugia]]; new foundations quickly followed in [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], and [[Padua]]. Saint [[Agnes of Assisi]], a sister of Clare, introduced the order to [[Spain]], where [[Barcelona]] and [[Burgos]] hosted major communities. The order further expanded to [[Belgium]] and [[France]] where a monastery was founded at [[Reims]] in 1229, followed by [[Montpellier]], [[Cahors]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Metz]], and [[Besan\u00e7on]].

Originally a separate community of [[Irish people|Irish women]] under a common [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]] with the English nuns, they moved to [[Dublin]] in 1629, the first monastic community in Ireland for a century. The first Abbess was [[Cecily Dillon]], a daughter of [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon]]. War forced the community to move back to Galway in 1642. From that point on, persecution under the [[Penal Laws]] and war led to repeated destruction of their monastery and scattering of the community over two centuries, until 1825, when fifteen nuns were able to re-establish monastic life permanently on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poorclares.ie/history.html|title=Poor Clares Galway - Ireland|first=Marek Mazur &|last=Team|accessdate=9 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102044547/http://poorclares.ie/history.html|archive-date=2 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLater monasteries were founded in 1906 in both [[Carlow]] and [[Dublin]].
