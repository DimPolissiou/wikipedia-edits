The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it.\n\nEvents can be purchased through a [[multichannel television]] platform using their [[electronic program guide]], an automated telephone system, or through a live [[customer service representative]]. There has been an increasing number of pay-per-views distributed via [[streaming video]] online, either alongside or in lieu of carriage through television providers. In 2012, the popular video sharing service [[YouTube]] began to allow partners to host live PPV events on the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/04/10/youtube-live-adds-pay-per-view-advertising/|title=YouTube enables pay-per-view option for live video streams|date=2012-04-10|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\nEvents distributed through PPV typically include [[combat sports]] events such as [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (focusing primarily on [[Card (sports)|cards]] that include one or more significant title fights), sports entertainment such as [[professional wrestling]], and concerts. In the past, PPV was often used to distribute telecasts of feature films, as well as adult content such as [[pornographic film]]s, but the growth of [[digital cable]] and [[streaming media]] caused these use cases to be subsumed by [[video on demand]] systems (which allow viewers to purchase and view pre-recorded content at any time) instead, leaving PPV to focus primarily on live event programs.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest form of pay-per-view was [[closed-circuit television]], also known as [[theatre television]], where [[professional boxing]] telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live.<ref name=\"Ezra\">{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&pg=PA105}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodyelbow\">{{cite news|title=History of Prizefighting's Biggest Money Fights|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/24/16170894/history-of-prizefightings-biggest-money-fights-boxing-mma-ufc|work=[[Bloody Elbow]]|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref> The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was [[Joe Louis]] vs. [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite book|title=Television|date=1965|publisher=Frederick A.

viewer can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it.\n\nEvents can be purchased through a [[multichannel television]] platform using their [[electronic program guide]], an automated telephone system, or through a live [[customer service representative]]. There has been an increasing number of pay-per-views distributed via [[streaming video]] online, either alongside or in lieu of carriage through television providers. In 2012, the popular video sharing service [[YouTube]] began to allow partners to host live PPV events on the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/04/10/youtube-live-adds-pay-per-view-advertising/|title=YouTube enables pay-per-view option for live video streams|date=2012-04-10|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\nEvents distributed through PPV typically include [[combat sports]] events such as [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (focusing primarily on [[Card (sports)|cards]] that include one or more significant title fights), sports entertainment such as [[professional wrestling]], and concerts. In the past, PPV was often used to distribute telecasts of feature films, as well as adult content such as [[pornographic film]]s, but the growth of [[digital cable]] and [[streaming media]] caused these use cases to be subsumed by [[video on demand]] systems (which allow viewers to purchase and view pre-recorded content at any time) instead, leaving PPV to focus primarily on live event programs.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest form of pay-per-view was [[closed-circuit television]], also known as [[theatre television]], where [[professional boxing]] telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live.<ref name=\"Ezra\">{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&pg=PA105}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodyelbow\">{{cite news|title=History of Prizefighting's Biggest Money Fights|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/24/16170894/history-of-prizefightings-biggest-money-fights-boxing-mma-ufc|work=[[Bloody Elbow]]|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref> The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was [[Joe Louis]] vs. [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite book|title=Television|date=1965|publisher=Frederick A.

The last couple of years has seen the number of pay-per-view boxing events significantly increase and currently all of the UK's top fights are only available via pay-per-view.

[[Western International Communications]] operated a separate service in the west initially known as Home Theatre; it was later rebranded as Viewers Choice under license.\n\nViewers Choice Canada was a partner in a French-language PPV service known as [[Canal Indigo]], which is now entirely owned by [[Videotron]]. [[Bell Canada]] launched a PPV service for its [[Bell TV|ExpressVu]] television provider known as [[Vu!]] in 1999.\n\nHome Theatre was later acquired by [[Shaw Communications]]; after gaining permission to operate nationally, it re-branded as a [[White-label product|white-label]] PPV known internally as [[Shaw PPV]] in December 2007. In 2014, due to [[Bell Media]]'s majority ownership of Viewers Choice because of its acquisition of Astral, and because both Bell and Rogers now ran their own in-house PPV operations (Vu! and [[Sportsnet PPV]]), Viewers Choice was shut down.<ref name=\"multinews-vcc-shutdown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/networks/viewers-choice-canada-winding-down/382680|first=Kent|last=Gibbons|title=Viewers Choice Canada Winding Down: Bell, Rogers-Owned Pay-Per-View Provider Closing Sept. 30|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=2014-07-22|accessdate=2014-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Mainland Europe===\nIn [[Romania]], cable communications operator UPC Romania has notified the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) on the intention to introduce in January, February 2014 at the latest, an on-demand audiovisual media service called Agerpres.

In 1986 he began a series of articles for ''Rolling Stone'' covering the opening of the Soviet underground rock music scene during the so-called glasnost (\u201copenness\u201d) period, which were published either with his own photographs or with images by noted rock photographer [[Anton Corbijn]].

The film, a co-production between ZDF/Arte, TV Slovenia and Benson\u2019s production company Kinetikon Pictures, features a visit to [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in Sri Lanka, among many other scenes shot in locations as diverse as Mongolia, Korea, Hong Kong, the United States, and Slovenia.\n\nFrom 2007-2010 Benson worked with director ''[[Terrence Malick]]'' to help produce space and cosmology sequences for Malick's ''[[The Tree of Life (film)]]'', which drew in part from Benson's book and exhibition projects. The film, which explored the origins of the universe and the beginning of life on Earth as well as its ultimate fate, won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Benson's work was also incorporated in Chilean documentary film director [[Patricio Guzman]]'s 2011 film ''[[Nostalgia for the Light]]'', which presented similarities between astronomers researching deep cosmological time and the struggle of Chileans still searching for the remains of relatives executed during [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship]].\n\n===As author, artist, and exhibitions producer===\nFollowing the success of ''Predictions of Fire'', by the mid-1990s Benson had begun using the internet to harvest photographs from deep space missions.

Abrams]], the New York publisher of illustrated books.\n\n[[File:Europa and Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot, Voyager 1, March 3, 1979 Michael Benson mosaic composite.jpg|thumb|''[[Europa and Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot, Voyager 1, March 3, 1979 (2003)]]'' Mosaic composite photograph by Benson]]\n\nBenson\u2019s book ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' (Harry N. Abrams, 2003; paperback edition 2008; children's edition 2009), features about 300 highly reprocessed photographs of the planets and moons of the solar system, as well as the sun. The book, which has an introduction by noted science fiction writer and space visionary [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and afterword by the award-winning American writer of non-fiction [[Lawrence Weschler]], culled shots from five decades of space probe images and repurposed them, positioning them as a chapter in the history of photography and the landscape. It won First Prize for Design, Special Trade General Books Category at the 2004 New York Book Fair and was called \u201cAn aesthetic revelation\u2026 a spectacular melding of science and art\u2026\u201d (''LA Times'') and a \"pioneering and magnificent collection of pictures\u2026 sublimely exhilarating\u2026\u201d (''Booklist''). ''Beyond'' was printed in English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese and Korean. From April 2007 to April 2008, an exhibition of large-scale photographic prints based on the book was displayed at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, and was described as a \u201cstunning series of pictures\u201d (''The New York Times'') and an \u201cextraordinary exhibition\u201d (''New York Magazine''). An exhibition of ''Beyond'' images was also toured around the United States by SITES, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Traveling Exhibitions Service, from 2008-2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sites.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibits/beyond/main.htm|title=Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service - About the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service's mission, history, and goals.|website=www.sites.si.edu|access-date=2016-12-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507163614/http://www.sites.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibits/beyond/main.htm|archivedate=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn discussing his work reprocessing raw image data from planetary science archives to produce composite landscapes, Benson has said that he is working to show that \u201cthe visual legacy of more than 50 years of interplanetary exploration constitutes a significant new chapter in the history of photography.\u201d On May 26, 2010 the largest-scale ''Beyond'' exhibition opened in the Art Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution's [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, DC. Featuring 148 prints spread across seven rooms, ''Beyond: Visions of Our Solar System'' was the largest collection of planetary [[landscape photography]] ever assembled in one place. The exhibition, which ran for a year, was described as \u201camazing\u201d by ''The Washington Post.'' However, reviewer Blake Gopnik also expressed some reservations about the show. \"Maybe my problem is that the space flight, the science, the getting-there and getting-the-shot are missing from these photos,\" he wrote. \"These photographs are gorgeous, and the worlds they show are wondrous. But I miss the scientists' grid-marks, the fractures in their panoramas, the artifacts of their filters, that might hint at how these strange worlds came to be before my eyes. My eyes see too much evident art in these photographs for my mind not to imagine that there's tons of artifice behind them.\"\n\nBenson's second book, ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle'', was published by Abrams Books in October 2009. A companion volume to ''Beyond'', ''Far Out'' covers such deep space phenomena as nebulae, star clusters, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. It also contains a series of short \"sidebar\" stories that trace various epochs of Earth history and link those periods to the main astronomical subjects of the books. These shorter stories are tied to the astronomical phenomena being depicted according to the light travel time between the Earth and the deep space objects in question. Reviewing the book for ''The New York Times,'' Dennis Overbye wrote \"Actually 'exquisite' does not really do justice to the aesthetic and literary merits of the book, published in the fall... You can sit and look through this book for hours and never be bored by the shapes, colors and textures into which cosmic creation can arrange itself, or you can actually read the accompanying learned essays. Mr. Benson\u2019s prose is up to its visual surroundings, no mean feat.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Benson accepted an invitation to be represented by a New York gallery, Hasted-Kraeutler on West 24th Street. He has since had two well-received solo shows in the gallery, which went out of business in 2015. Following his February\u2013March 2011 show, photography critic [[Vicki Goldberg]] wrote that \u201cSome of the most beautiful and important photographs ever taken turn out to be images of outer space... So it is with a shiver of awe that we view Michael Benson's large, digitally composed photographs based on pictures captured by robotic space probes.\u201d (''Art News'') Benson is now represented in the UK by London's Flowers Gallery and its managing director, [[Matthew Flowers]].\n\nBenson's third book, ''Planetfall: New Solar System Visions'', came out in October 2012. German and Japanese editions were published in the fall of 2013. His fourth book for Abrams, ''Cosmigraphics: Picturing Space Through Time'', received front-page coverage in \"The New York Times\" when it was released in October 2014. \"Cosmigraphics\" surveys 4000 years of attempts to represent the universe graphically.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Michael Benson and Brian Eno.jpg|thumb|''Michael Benson and Brian Eno'' Benson and [[Brian Eno]] at the opening of \"Otherworlds\" at London's Natural History Museum, January 20th 2016]]  -->\n\nOn January 22, Benson's large exhibition of planetary landscapes, \"Otherworlds: Visions of Our Solar System,\" opened in the Jerwood Gallery of the Natural History Museum in London. Featuring a new ambient composition by [[Brian Eno]], the show features 77 digital chromogenic prints of extraterrestrial vistas. After closing in London on May 15, \"Otherworlds\" will move to the Natural History Museum in Vienna for the summer of 2016.\n\nIn April 2018, Simon & Schuster published Benson's nonfiction book ''Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece''.\n\nMichael Benson is currently working with a scanning electron microscope at the Center for Bits and Atoms at the MIT Media Lab and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York on a project called \"Nanocosmos.\"\n\nHe is a Fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Michael Benson}}\n*[http://michael-benson.net/], Michael Benson's website\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/science/space/michael-bensons-planetfall-offers-a-scrapbook-of-space-exploration.html New York Times review of Benson's 2012 book Planetfall]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/science/05books.html New York Times review of Benson's 2009 book Far Out]\n*[http://www.pdnonline.com/features/QandA-With-Michael-Ben-6886.shtml Photo District News Interview with Michael Benson in October 2012]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/arts/design/29museum.html Edward Rothstein's July 2010 New York Times review of Benson's Smithsonian exhibition]\n*[https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/predictions-of-fire-1200444845/ Emanuel Levy's 1996 Variety review of Benson's film Predictions of Fire]\n*[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/travel-to-the-remote-edges-of-our-solar-system-at-the-natural-hi.html Press release by Natural History Museum London for Benson's show Otherworlds]\n*[https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/01/photography.html The Economist review of Benson's 2016 exhibition Otherworlds]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benson, Michael}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American documentary filmmakers]]\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the TV screenwriter|Mike Benson (screenwriter)}}\n{{BLP sources|date=January 2009}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name           = Michael Benson\n| image          = Michael Benson, artist, writer, filmmaker.jpg\n| image_size     = 250px\n| alt            = Headshot of Michael Benson, artist, writer, filmmaker\n| caption        =\n| occupation     = Writer, photographer and filmmaker\n| nationality = [[United States]]\n| birth_date     = {{Birth date|mf=yes|1962|3|31}}\n| birth_place    = [[Munich]], [[Germany]]\n| years active = 1985 \u2013 present\n| website        = {{url|michael-benson.net}}\n}}\n\n'''Michael Benson''' (born March 31, 1962) is an American artist, writer, filmmaker, and exhibitions producer.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Journalism career===\nAfter receiving a BA in English with a minor in photography at the State University of New York at Albany in 1984, Benson worked as a news assistant and occasional contributor to ''The New York Times'', but he left the paper after two years to pursue a career as a freelance journalist.

An exhibition of ''Beyond'' images was also toured around the United States by SITES, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Traveling Exhibitions Service, from 2008-2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sites.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibits/beyond/main.htm|title=Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service - About the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service's mission, history, and goals.|website=www.sites.si.edu|access-date=2016-12-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507163614/http://www.sites.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibits/beyond/main.htm|archivedate=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn discussing his work reprocessing raw image data from planetary science archives to produce composite landscapes, Benson has said that he is working to show that \u201cthe visual legacy of more than 50 years of interplanetary exploration constitutes a significant new chapter in the history of photography.\u201d On May 26, 2010 the largest-scale ''Beyond'' exhibition opened in the Art Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution's [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, DC. Featuring 148 prints spread across seven rooms, ''Beyond: Visions of Our Solar System'' was the largest collection of planetary [[landscape photography]] ever assembled in one place. The exhibition, which ran for a year, was described as \u201camazing\u201d by ''The Washington Post.'' However, reviewer Blake Gopnik also expressed some reservations about the show. \"Maybe my problem is that the space flight, the science, the getting-there and getting-the-shot are missing from these photos,\" he wrote. \"These photographs are gorgeous, and the worlds they show are wondrous. But I miss the scientists' grid-marks, the fractures in their panoramas, the artifacts of their filters, that might hint at how these strange worlds came to be before my eyes. My eyes see too much evident art in these photographs for my mind not to imagine that there's tons of artifice behind them.\"\n\nBenson's second book, ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle'', was published by Abrams Books in October 2009. A companion volume to ''Beyond'', ''Far Out'' covers such deep space phenomena as nebulae, star clusters, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. It also contains a series of short \"sidebar\" stories that trace various epochs of Earth history and link those periods to the main astronomical subjects of the books. These shorter stories are tied to the astronomical phenomena being depicted according to the light travel time between the Earth and the deep space objects in question. Reviewing the book for ''The New York Times,'' Dennis Overbye wrote \"Actually 'exquisite' does not really do justice to the aesthetic and literary merits of the book, published in the fall... You can sit and look through this book for hours and never be bored by the shapes, colors and textures into which cosmic creation can arrange itself, or you can actually read the accompanying learned essays. Mr. Benson\u2019s prose is up to its visual surroundings, no mean feat.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Benson accepted an invitation to be represented by a New York gallery, Hasted-Kraeutler on West 24th Street. He has since had two well-received solo shows in the gallery, which went out of business in 2015. Following his February\u2013March 2011 show, photography critic [[Vicki Goldberg]] wrote that \u201cSome of the most beautiful and important photographs ever taken turn out to be images of outer space... So it is with a shiver of awe that we view Michael Benson's large, digitally composed photographs based on pictures captured by robotic space probes.\u201d (''Art News'') Benson is now represented in the UK by London's Flowers Gallery and its managing director, [[Matthew Flowers]].\n\nBenson's third book, ''Planetfall: New Solar System Visions'', came out in October 2012. German and Japanese editions were published in the fall of 2013. His fourth book for Abrams, ''Cosmigraphics: Picturing Space Through Time'', received front-page coverage in \"The New York Times\" when it was released in October 2014. \"Cosmigraphics\" surveys 4000 years of attempts to represent the universe graphically.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Michael Benson and Brian Eno.jpg|thumb|''Michael Benson and Brian Eno'' Benson and [[Brian Eno]] at the opening of \"Otherworlds\" at London's Natural History Museum, January 20th 2016]]  -->\n\nOn January 22, Benson's large exhibition of planetary landscapes, \"Otherworlds: Visions of Our Solar System,\" opened in the Jerwood Gallery of the Natural History Museum in London. Featuring a new ambient composition by [[Brian Eno]], the show features 77 digital chromogenic prints of extraterrestrial vistas. After closing in London on May 15, \"Otherworlds\" will move to the Natural History Museum in Vienna for the summer of 2016.\n\nIn April 2018, Simon & Schuster published Benson's nonfiction book ''Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece''.\n\nMichael Benson is currently working with a scanning electron microscope at the Center for Bits and Atoms at the MIT Media Lab and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York on a project called \"Nanocosmos.\"\n\nHe is a Fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Michael Benson}}\n*[http://michael-benson.net/], Michael Benson's website\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/science/space/michael-bensons-planetfall-offers-a-scrapbook-of-space-exploration.html New York Times review of Benson's 2012 book Planetfall]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/science/05books.html New York Times review of Benson's 2009 book Far Out]\n*[http://www.pdnonline.com/features/QandA-With-Michael-Ben-6886.shtml Photo District News Interview with Michael Benson in October 2012]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/arts/design/29museum.html Edward Rothstein's July 2010 New York Times review of Benson's Smithsonian exhibition]\n*[https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/predictions-of-fire-1200444845/ Emanuel Levy's 1996 Variety review of Benson's film Predictions of Fire]\n*[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/travel-to-the-remote-edges-of-our-solar-system-at-the-natural-hi.html Press release by Natural History Museum London for Benson's show Otherworlds]\n*[https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/01/photography.html The Economist review of Benson's 2016 exhibition Otherworlds]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benson, Michael}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American documentary filmmakers]]\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Benson_(filmmaker)"}

The Conference led to what is now called the [[Monterrey Consensus]] where signatories acknowledged \"\u2026the value of exploring innovative sources of finance provided that those sources do not unduly burden developing countries.\"\nInnovative financing mechanisms were born out of a need to reach the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations agreed to achieve by the year 2015.
