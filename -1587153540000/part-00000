At the time, May was working on his PhD in [[Astronomy]].<ref name=\"QOnline\">{{cite web|author=Greg Brooks |author2=Gary Taylor |url=http://queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/day-races/ |title=A Day At The Races |website=Queenonline.com |accessdate=2016-10-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926213701/http://queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/day-races/ |archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> He wrote it on [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and thought he'd change the title and chorus later on, but when he brought it to the band for inclusion on this album, [[Freddie Mercury]] liked the original and it was kept the way it was written.<ref name=\"QOnline\" />\n\nThe song is preceded, first, by a multi-tracked guitar part reminiscent of the song \"White Man,\" then by a one-minute instrumental intro using a [[Shepard tone]] harmonium figure, which is reprised in the ending of \"Teo Torriatte\": this was intended to create a \"circle\" in the album. The ascending scale was created by recording a descending scale on a harmonium and playing it backwards for the album.\n\nThe main bulk of the song can be described as heavy blues rock, featuring aggressive vocals by lead singer Mercury as well as a slide guitar solo by May, who also provided most of the backing vocals.\n\nA music video was made for the song, directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], based on a performance clip shot at [[Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Long Island]], New York in February 1977 during the band's US arena headlining tour.<ref>[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/queen2.htm#1977datrnorthamerica 1977 A Day At The Races North American Tour] Ultimate Queen. Retrieved 31 August 2011</ref> After its release in 1976, the song was played by Queen on every subsequent tour.<ref>[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen.html Queen on tour] Queen Concerts. Retrieved 10 July 2011</ref>\n\n====\"You Take My Breath Away\"====\n\"You Take My Breath Away\" was written by Mercury and based on the [[harmonic minor]] scale<!--the original poster is mistaken about the scale - see wiki's reference to the harmonic minor.-->. All of the vocals and piano were done by him, and he performed it by himself at Hyde Park before recording it. There is a vocal interlude between this song and the next one that begins with a wash of vocals (repeating the words \"take my breath\") created by [[Delay (audio effect)|echoes]] (of a multi-tracked Mercury) regenerating in reverse, which gradually evolves into the repeated phrase \"you take my (breath away)\" and reintegrates into the next track, \"Long Away\".\n\n====\"Long Away\"====\n{{Main|Long Away}}\n\"Long Away\" was composed and sung by May. He used a Burns Double Six [[Twelve string guitar|12-string]] electric guitar for the rhythm parts instead of his [[Red Special]]. May had wanted to use a [[Rickenbacker]] because he admired [[John Lennon]], but did not get along well with the thin neck of the instrument. The single was released in the US, Canada and New Zealand but did not chart anywhere.\n\n====\"The Millionaire Waltz\"====\n\"The Millionaire Waltz\" was written by Mercury about [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] (Queen and [[Elton John]]'s manager at the time).<ref name=\"QOnline\" /> It is another multi-key and multi-metre song like \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", using abrupt arrangement changes and including May doing multi-tracked guitar choirs. It's a noteworthy example of [[John Deacon]]'s 'lead bass' playing, which can be heard quite prominently during the first two minutes of the song in which only Deacon and Mercury play (bass guitar and piano respectively).\n\nAbout two minutes into the song it changes character from the 3/4 waltz to a 12/8 hard rock segment, which lasts for about thirty seconds. The song then goes back to 3/4 metre and features a multi-layered guitar solo by May.\n\n====\"You and I\"====\n\"You and I\" is Deacon's song on the album. The song is in the key of D major, is mainly piano-driven and features Deacon on [[acoustic guitar]]. The song was never played live. It was featured as the b-side for \"Tie Your Mother Down\".\n\n===Side two===\n====\"Somebody to Love\"====\n{{Main|Somebody to Love (Queen song)}}\n\"Somebody to Love\" is the [[Hit song|hit single]] of the album. Written by Mercury, the song was inspired by [[gospel music|gospel]] music, especially that of [[Aretha Franklin]], and Mercury, May and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] multi-tracked their voices to achieve the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir.<ref name=\"QOnline\" />\n\nLike \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the major hit from Queen's previous album, this song has a complex layering of vocal tracks, this time based on a gospel choir arrangement.\n\nStaying true to Queen's guitar-driven style, it was also filled with intricate harmony parts and a solo by May.<ref name=\"Amusic\">[http://www.allmusic.com/song/somebody-to-love-t2415720 Queen: Somebody to Love] Allmusic. Retrieved 6 July 2011</ref> Mercury recorded a wide range of notes, going from a G{{sharp}}2 (in the last choral verse) to a falsetto G{{sharp}}5 (at the peak of his [[melisma]] on \"ooh\" over the choir break). It went to number two on the UK charts (after \"[[Under the Moon of Love]]\" \u2013 [[Showaddywaddy]] was at number one) and number 13 on the US singles chart.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2006). The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Book of Top 40 Hits. Billboard Books</ref><ref>Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref>\n\n====\"White Man\"====\n\"White Man\" was written by May about the suffering of Native Americans at the hands of European immigrants, taking the viewpoint of native peoples. This song would be the focal point for a Mercury vocal solo on the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] and serve as both a Mercury vocal solo spot and a May [[guitar solo]] spot on the 1977\u201378 ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' tour. The song is one of Queen's heaviest works, thematically and musically. On the later [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005 Return of the Champions Tour]] and the later [[Rock The Cosmos Tour|2008 Tour]] the riff to \"White Man\" was used as an introduction to \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\".\n\n====\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\"====\n{{Main|Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy}}\n\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" was written by Mercury. It starts with a piano and vocal introduction by Mercury, then continues, with the bass and drums adding on, at the start of the chorus. The second verse is sung, followed by another chorus. At this point, the drums, bass and guitar drop out, which then leads into the bridge, sung by Mercury and [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]]. Following the May guitar solo, another verse is sung, and then the chorus ends the track.\n\nMulti-tracked vocals enhanced the song as well as May's guitar choirs. The song was once performed live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June 1977, with Taylor singing Stone's part. Most of the track was a concert staple on the band's ''A Day at the Races Tour'' and ''[[News of the World Tour]]''.<ref>[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/adatreu.html Queen live on tour: A Day At The Races: Setlist] Queen Concerts.

Retrieved 31 August 2011</ref>\n\n====\"Drowse\"====\n\"Drowse\" was Roger Taylor's song in 6/8 having him playing rhythm guitar and timpani and doing all of the vocals. May played [[slide guitar]] during this and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" (the second guitar solo in the middle of the song). Taylor's song on the previous album, \"[[I'm In Love With My Car]]\", was also in 6/8. The song has never been performed live but was rehearsed by [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] before their [[Queen + Adam Lambert Rock Big Ben Live|Rock Big Ben Live]] concert. The song also made an appearance on both the standard and deluxe editions of [[Queen Forever]].\n\n====\"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\"====\n{{Main|Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)}}\n\"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\" was May's tribute to the Japanese fans. It was performed live in Tokyo during the Jazz tour in 1979 and again when the band visited Japan during The Game and Hot Space tours in 1981 and 1982 respectively.\n\nThe song is notable for having two choruses sung in Japanese; it is one of only three Queen songs (the others being \"[[Las Palabras de Amor]]\" from ''[[Hot Space]]'' and \"[[Mustapha (Queen song)|Mustapha]]\", from ''[[Jazz (Queen album)|Jazz]]'') in which an entire verse or chorus is sung in a language other than English. The song features a piano, a plastic piano and a [[Pump organ|harmonium]], which are all played by May.\n\nThe album's closing harmonium melody is also its opening melody; the sequence was attached to the beginning of \"Tie Your Mother Down\", the first track on the album. May described it as \"a never-ending staircase\", otherwise commonly known, musically, as a [[Shepard tone]].\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=a-day-at-the-races-r2218694/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|date=19 April 1992|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-19/entertainment/9202040743_1_star-queen-ii-flash-gordon|title=An 18-record, 80 Million-copy Odyssey|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|year=2011|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857125958|edition=5th|page=2248}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev4score = 6.6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/|title=Queen: Reissues Album Review|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n|rev5Score = 7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramirez |first=AJ |date=8 June 2011 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/142525-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-the-first-five-queen-albums/ |title=In the Lap of the Gods: The First Five Queen Albums |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=19 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126012135/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/142525-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-the-first-five-queen-albums/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"q\">''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', September 1993, p.118: \"The breadth of its ambition remains ever impressive, as do tracks such as May's stomping 'Tie Your Mother Down' and Mercury's baroque one-two, 'Somebody To Love' and 'Gold Old-Fashioned Lover Boy'.\"</ref> \n|rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"rolling\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/a-day-at-the-races-19770224|title=A Day At The Races|last=Marsh|first=Dave|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 February 1977|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"RSguide\"/>\n|rev9 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/queen-the-first-five-albums|title=Queen \u2013 The First Five Albums \u2013 Uncut|publisher=}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album garnered positive reviews from critics, with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' describing ''A Day at the Races'' as \"a judicious blend of heavy metal rockers and classically influenced, almost operatic, torch songs.\"<ref name=\"washington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_02-07-1977_-_A_Day_at_the_Races_-_Washington_Post|title=Queen Interviews \u2013 Queen \u2013 02-07-1977 \u2013 A Day at the Races \u2013 Washington Post \u2013 Queen Archives: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Interviews, Articles, Reviews|publisher=}}</ref> The ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' was also appreciative, writing, \"''Races'' is a reconfirmation of Queen's position as the best of the third wave of English rock groups.\"<ref name=\"winnipeg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_01-20-1977_-_A_Day_at_the_Races_-_Winnipeg_Free_Press|title=Queen Interviews \u2013 Queen \u2013 01-20-1977 \u2013 A Day at the Races \u2013 Winnipeg Free Press \u2013 Queen Archives: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Interviews, Articles, Reviews|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' gave the album a mixed review, writing, \"With ''A Day at the Races'', they've deserted art-rock entirely.

On the tape, an early mix of \u201cTie Your Mother Down\u201d was used, along with a slightly alternate version of \u201cYou Take My Breath Away\u201d. A different version of \u201cTeo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\u201d was also included on the tape. A mix of \u201cLong Away\u201d, \u201cDrowse\u201d, and \u201cTie Your Mother Down\u201d is created on 9 November 1976. On 16 November 1976, copies of \u201cYou and I\u201d, and \u201cThe Millionaire Waltz\u201d were created. After one or two mastering sessions, A Day at the Races was completed on 19 November 1976.\n\n==Songs==\n===Side one===\n====\"Tie Your Mother Down\"====\n{{Main|Tie Your Mother Down}}\n\"Tie Your Mother Down\" was written in [[Tenerife]] by [[Brian May]] in early 1968, two years before the formation of Queen.  At the time, May was working on his PhD in [[Astronomy]].<ref name=\"QOnline\">{{cite web|author=Greg Brooks |author2=Gary Taylor |url=http://queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/day-races/ |title=A Day At The Races |website=Queenonline.com |accessdate=2016-10-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926213701/http://queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/day-races/ |archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> He wrote it on [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and thought he'd change the title and chorus later on, but when he brought it to the band for inclusion on this album, [[Freddie Mercury]] liked the original and it was kept the way it was written.<ref name=\"QOnline\" />\n\nThe song is preceded, first, by a multi-tracked guitar part reminiscent of the song \"White Man,\" then by a one-minute instrumental intro using a [[Shepard tone]] harmonium figure, which is reprised in the ending of \"Teo Torriatte\": this was intended to create a \"circle\" in the album. The ascending scale was created by recording a descending scale on a harmonium and playing it backwards for the album.\n\nThe main bulk of the song can be described as heavy blues rock, featuring aggressive vocals by lead singer Mercury as well as a slide guitar solo by May, who also provided most of the backing vocals.\n\nA music video was made for the song, directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], based on a performance clip shot at [[Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Long Island]], New York in February 1977 during the band's US arena headlining tour.<ref>[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/queen2.htm#1977datrnorthamerica 1977 A Day At The Races North American Tour] Ultimate Queen. Retrieved 31 August 2011</ref> After its release in 1976, the song was played by Queen on every subsequent tour.<ref>[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen.html Queen on tour] Queen Concerts. Retrieved 10 July 2011</ref>\n\n====\"You Take My Breath Away\"====\n\"You Take My Breath Away\" was written by Mercury and based on the [[harmonic minor]] scale<!--the original poster is mistaken about the scale - see wiki's reference to the harmonic minor.-->. All of the vocals and piano were done by him, and he performed it by himself at Hyde Park before recording it. There is a vocal interlude between this song and the next one that begins with a wash of vocals (repeating the words \"take my breath\") created by [[Delay (audio effect)|echoes]] (of a multi-tracked Mercury) regenerating in reverse, which gradually evolves into the repeated phrase \"you take my (breath away)\" and reintegrates into the next track, \"Long Away\".\n\n====\"Long Away\"====\n{{Main|Long Away}}\n\"Long Away\" was composed and sung by May. He used a Burns Double Six [[Twelve string guitar|12-string]] electric guitar for the rhythm parts instead of his [[Red Special]]. May had wanted to use a [[Rickenbacker]] because he admired [[John Lennon]], but did not get along well with the thin neck of the instrument. The single was released in the US, Canada and New Zealand but did not chart anywhere.\n\n====\"The Millionaire Waltz\"====\n\"The Millionaire Waltz\" was written by Mercury about [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] (Queen and [[Elton John]]'s manager at the time).<ref name=\"QOnline\" /> It is another multi-key and multi-metre song like \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", using abrupt arrangement changes and including May doing multi-tracked guitar choirs. It's a noteworthy example of [[John Deacon]]'s 'lead bass' playing, which can be heard quite prominently during the first two minutes of the song in which only Deacon and Mercury play (bass guitar and piano respectively).\n\nAbout two minutes into the song it changes character from the 3/4 waltz to a 12/8 hard rock segment, which lasts for about thirty seconds. The song then goes back to 3/4 metre and features a multi-layered guitar solo by May.\n\n====\"You and I\"====\n\"You and I\" is Deacon's song on the album. The song is in the key of D major, is mainly piano-driven and features Deacon on [[acoustic guitar]]. The song was never played live. It was featured as the b-side for \"Tie Your Mother Down\".\n\n===Side two===\n====\"Somebody to Love\"====\n{{Main|Somebody to Love (Queen song)}}\n\"Somebody to Love\" is the [[Hit song|hit single]] of the album. Written by Mercury, the song was inspired by [[gospel music|gospel]] music, especially that of [[Aretha Franklin]], and Mercury, May and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] multi-tracked their voices to achieve the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir.<ref name=\"QOnline\" />\n\nLike \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the major hit from Queen's previous album, this song has a complex layering of vocal tracks, this time based on a gospel choir arrangement.\n\nStaying true to Queen's guitar-driven style, it was also filled with intricate harmony parts and a solo by May.<ref name=\"Amusic\">[http://www.allmusic.com/song/somebody-to-love-t2415720 Queen: Somebody to Love] Allmusic. Retrieved 6 July 2011</ref> Mercury recorded a wide range of notes, going from a G{{sharp}}2 (in the last choral verse) to a falsetto G{{sharp}}5 (at the peak of his [[melisma]] on \"ooh\" over the choir break). It went to number two on the UK charts (after \"[[Under the Moon of Love]]\" \u2013 [[Showaddywaddy]] was at number one) and number 13 on the US singles chart.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2006). The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Book of Top 40 Hits. Billboard Books</ref><ref>Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref>\n\n====\"White Man\"====\n\"White Man\" was written by May about the suffering of Native Americans at the hands of European immigrants, taking the viewpoint of native peoples. This song would be the focal point for a Mercury vocal solo on the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] and serve as both a Mercury vocal solo spot and a May [[guitar solo]] spot on the 1977\u201378 ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' tour. The song is one of Queen's heaviest works, thematically and musically. On the later [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005 Return of the Champions Tour]] and the later [[Rock The Cosmos Tour|2008 Tour]] the riff to \"White Man\" was used as an introduction to \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\".\n\n====\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\"====\n{{Main|Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy}}\n\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" was written by Mercury. It starts with a piano and vocal introduction by Mercury, then continues, with the bass and drums adding on, at the start of the chorus. The second verse is sung, followed by another chorus. At this point, the drums, bass and guitar drop out, which then leads into the bridge, sung by Mercury and [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]]. Following the May guitar solo, another verse is sung, and then the chorus ends the track.\n\nMulti-tracked vocals enhanced the song as well as May's guitar choirs. The song was once performed live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June 1977, with Taylor singing Stone's part. Most of the track was a concert staple on the band's ''A Day at the Races Tour'' and ''[[News of the World Tour]]''.<ref>[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/adatreu.html Queen live on tour: A Day At The Races: Setlist] Queen Concerts.

Retrieved 31 August 2011</ref>\n\n====\"Drowse\"====\n\"Drowse\" was Roger Taylor's song in 6/8 having him playing rhythm guitar and timpani and doing all of the vocals. May played [[slide guitar]] during this and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" (the second guitar solo in the middle of the song). Taylor's song on the previous album, \"[[I'm In Love With My Car]]\", was also in 6/8. The song has never been performed live but was rehearsed by [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] before their [[Queen + Adam Lambert Rock Big Ben Live|Rock Big Ben Live]] concert. The song also made an appearance on both the standard and deluxe editions of [[Queen Forever]].\n\n====\"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\"====\n{{Main|Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)}}\n\"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\" was May's tribute to the Japanese fans. It was performed live in Tokyo during the Jazz tour in 1979 and again when the band visited Japan during The Game and Hot Space tours in 1981 and 1982 respectively.\n\nThe song is notable for having two choruses sung in Japanese; it is one of only three Queen songs (the others being \"[[Las Palabras de Amor]]\" from ''[[Hot Space]]'' and \"[[Mustapha (Queen song)|Mustapha]]\", from ''[[Jazz (Queen album)|Jazz]]'') in which an entire verse or chorus is sung in a language other than English. The song features a piano, a plastic piano and a [[Pump organ|harmonium]], which are all played by May.\n\nThe album's closing harmonium melody is also its opening melody; the sequence was attached to the beginning of \"Tie Your Mother Down\", the first track on the album. May described it as \"a never-ending staircase\", otherwise commonly known, musically, as a [[Shepard tone]].\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=a-day-at-the-races-r2218694/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|date=19 April 1992|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-19/entertainment/9202040743_1_star-queen-ii-flash-gordon|title=An 18-record, 80 Million-copy Odyssey|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|year=2011|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857125958|edition=5th|page=2248}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev4score = 6.6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/|title=Queen: Reissues Album Review|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n|rev5Score = 7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramirez |first=AJ |date=8 June 2011 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/142525-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-the-first-five-queen-albums/ |title=In the Lap of the Gods: The First Five Queen Albums |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=19 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126012135/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/142525-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-the-first-five-queen-albums/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"q\">''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', September 1993, p.118: \"The breadth of its ambition remains ever impressive, as do tracks such as May's stomping 'Tie Your Mother Down' and Mercury's baroque one-two, 'Somebody To Love' and 'Gold Old-Fashioned Lover Boy'.\"</ref> \n|rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"rolling\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/a-day-at-the-races-19770224|title=A Day At The Races|last=Marsh|first=Dave|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 February 1977|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"RSguide\"/>\n|rev9 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/queen-the-first-five-albums|title=Queen \u2013 The First Five Albums \u2013 Uncut|publisher=}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album garnered positive reviews from critics, with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' describing ''A Day at the Races'' as \"a judicious blend of heavy metal rockers and classically influenced, almost operatic, torch songs.\"<ref name=\"washington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_02-07-1977_-_A_Day_at_the_Races_-_Washington_Post|title=Queen Interviews \u2013 Queen \u2013 02-07-1977 \u2013 A Day at the Races \u2013 Washington Post \u2013 Queen Archives: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Interviews, Articles, Reviews|publisher=}}</ref> The ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' was also appreciative, writing, \"''Races'' is a reconfirmation of Queen's position as the best of the third wave of English rock groups.\"<ref name=\"winnipeg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_01-20-1977_-_A_Day_at_the_Races_-_Winnipeg_Free_Press|title=Queen Interviews \u2013 Queen \u2013 01-20-1977 \u2013 A Day at the Races \u2013 Winnipeg Free Press \u2013 Queen Archives: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Interviews, Articles, Reviews|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' gave the album a mixed review, writing, \"With ''A Day at the Races'', they've deserted art-rock entirely.

His mother was from an [[Aberdeenshire]] family that had connections with the wine business and his father was from [[Belfast]], Ireland and worked as a factor in the [[Wine|wine trade]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Lenard |first=Philipp |title=Great Men of Science |year=1950 |publisher=G.

In 1746 at the age of 18 he entered the [[University of Glasgow]], studying there for four years before spending another four at the [[University of Edinburgh]], furthering his medical studies.

Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance of the time and became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Equal Arm Analytical Balances | work =  | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/balances/index.html | accessdate = 8 March 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170513054241/https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/balances/index.html | archive-date = 13 May 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Latent heat===\n[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782\u201383, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the heat evolved in various [[chemical change]]s, calculations which were based on Joseph Black's prior discovery of [[latent heat]].]]\n\nIn 1757, Black was appointed [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Glasgow|Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine]] at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n\nIn 1761 he deduced that the application of heat to [[ice]] at its melting point does not cause a rise in temperature of the ice/water mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of water in the mixture. Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become [[latent heat|latent]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black, Joseph|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nThe theory of latent heat marks the beginning of [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715\u20131783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper & Row| pages = 117 and 283 }}</ref> Black's theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different [[specific heat]]s.\n\nThe theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the [[steam engine]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715\u20131783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = | page = 283 | isbn = }}</ref> Black and [[James Watt]] became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]]. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt's early research in steam power. Black's discovery of the latent heat of water would have been interesting to Watt, informing his attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] and develop the science of thermodynamics.\n\n===Carbon dioxide===\nBlack also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called \"fixed air.\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is produced by animal [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[microbial]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n==Professorship==\nIn 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded [[William Cullen]] as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by [[Alexander Stevenson (physician)|Alexander Stevenson]].<ref>Medical and Philosophical Commentaries 1792</ref>\n\nAt this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement.\n\nBlack was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178\u2013196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='Useful Pictures: Joseph Black and the Graphic Culture of Experimentation', in Robert G.

In 1746 at the age of 18 he entered the [[University of Glasgow]], studying there for four years before spending another four at the [[University of Edinburgh]], furthering his medical studies.

Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become [[latent heat|latent]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black, Joseph|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nThe theory of latent heat marks the beginning of [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715\u20131783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper & Row| pages = 117 and 283 }}</ref> Black's theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different [[specific heat]]s.\n\nThe theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the [[steam engine]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715\u20131783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = | page = 283 | isbn = }}</ref> Black and [[James Watt]] became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]]. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt's early research in steam power. Black's discovery of the latent heat of water would have been interesting to Watt, informing his attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] and develop the science of thermodynamics.\n\n===Carbon dioxide===\nBlack also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called \"fixed air.\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is produced by animal [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[microbial]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n==Professorship==\nIn 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded [[William Cullen]] as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by [[Alexander Stevenson (physician)|Alexander Stevenson]].<ref>Medical and Philosophical Commentaries 1792</ref>\n\nAt this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement.\n\nBlack was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178\u2013196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='Useful Pictures: Joseph Black and the Graphic Culture of Experimentation', in Robert G.
