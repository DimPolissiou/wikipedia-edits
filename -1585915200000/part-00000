By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Viewpoint'' was developed by [[Aicom]] and published by [[Sammy Corporation]] in November 1992. It was one of Sammy's first forays into the video game industry after a lengthy hiatus in the 1980s. It was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] hardware family, specifically the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system board.\n\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.

The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} five reviewers scored the Genesis version 8, 6, 7, 7, and 7 out of 10 (average 7 out of 10). Though they noted that it has some severe slowdown and music which fails to approximate the original version's, they rated it as an overall good conversion.<ref name=\"egm65\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Viewpoint|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|page=40}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' similarly said that though the graphics and music fail to effectively recreate those of the Neo Geo version, it is an exceptionally good port given that it is for a less powerful system and on a cartridge a fraction of the size of the Neo Geo one.

They praised the PlayStation version's improved visuals over the Neo Geo version, but most felt that the new soundtrack was inappropriate. All four reviewers concurred that the game is \"unbelievably hard\", but were divided on whether this was a good or bad thing.<ref name=\"egm78\">{{cite journal |title=Review Crew: Viewpoint|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=January 1996|page=44}}</ref> ''GamePro'' took the side of it being a bad thing; though they praised the \"fresh, futuristic look\" and enhanced audio of the PlayStation version, they felt the combination of overly high difficulty and \"gummy\" controls made the game not fun to play.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Viewpoint|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=89|publisher=[[IDG]]|date=February 1996|page=54}}</ref> ''Next Generation'' said that while the Neo Geo original is justifiably held in high esteem, the PlayStation conversion suffers from slow pacing, sluggish control, and most especially the excessively hard difficulty: \"We have no idea what kind of sadist converted this, but unless you're also an equally extreme masochist, give it a wide berth.\"<ref name=\"NGen13\">{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=153}}</ref> ''Maximum'' also held the PlayStation version to be inferior to the Neo Geo version, commenting that though the graphics were generally improved, some sections looked better on the Neo Geo, and the music and gameplay were much worse.
