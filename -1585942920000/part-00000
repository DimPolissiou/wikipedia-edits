He was a younger brother of the [[Austrian emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. After a distinguished career in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]] as its commander, he accepted an offer by [[Napoleon III]] of France to rule Mexico, conditional on a national plebiscite in his favour. France, together with Spain and the United Kingdom, [[Second French intervention in Mexico|invaded the Mexican Republic]] in the winter of 1861, ostensibly to collect debts; the Spanish and British both withdrew the following year after negotiating agreements with Mexico's republican government, while France sought to conquer the country. Seeking to legitimize French rule, Napoleon III invited Maximilian to establish a new pro-[[Second French Empire|French]] Mexican monarchy. With the support of the French army and a group of [[Conservative Party (Mexico)|Conservative Party]] monarchists hostile to the [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberal Party]] administration of the new Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], Maximilian was offered the position of [[Emperor of Mexico]], which he accepted on 10 April 1864.<ref name=\"RoyalArk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Mexico/mexico4.htm|title=MEXICO4|website=www.royalark.net}}</ref>\n\nThe Empire managed to gain the recognition of several European powers, including Britain, Austria, and Prussia.{{sfn|Harding|1934|pp=175}} The United States however, continued to recognize Ju\u00e1rez as the legal president of Mexico. Maximilian never completely defeated the Mexican Republic; Republican forces led by Ju\u00e1rez continued to be active during Maximilian's rule. With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States (which had been too distracted by its own conflict to respond to the Europeans' 1861 invasion in what it considered to be its [[sphere of influence]]) began providing more explicit aid to Ju\u00e1rez's forces. Matters worsened for Maximilian after French armies withdrew from Mexico in 1866. The Empire collapsed, and he was captured and executed by the Mexican government, which then restored the Mexican Republic.\n\nHis wife, [[Carlota of Mexico|Charlotte of Belgium]], who had left for Europe earlier to try to build support for her husband's regime, suffered an emotional collapse after his death and apparently became insane.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[New York Times]]\n|date=March 6, 1885\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/06/102957723.pdf\n|title=Charlotte of Mexico's Misfortune}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as a boy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maximilian as a boy, 1838]]\nMaximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]], capital of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=6}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Corti|1929|p=41}} He was baptized the following day as ''Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph''.

Until his sixth birthday, he was cared for by Baroness [[Louise von Sturmfeder]], who was his ''aja'' (then rendered \"nurse\", now [[nanny]]). Afterward, his education was entrusted to a tutor.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|pp=6\u20137}} Most of Maximilian's day was spent in study. The hours per week of classes steadily increased from 32 at age seven to 55 by the time he was 17.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=7}} The disciplines were diverse, ranging from history, geography, law and technology, to languages, military studies, fencing and diplomacy.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=7}} In addition to his native [[German language|German]], he eventually learned to speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{sfn|Hall|1868|p=17}} From an early age, Maximilian tried to surpass his older brother Franz Joseph in everything, attempting to prove to all that he was the better qualified of the two and thus deserving of more than second-place status.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Maximiliaan_van_Oostenrijk.png|thumb|right|250px|Maximilian painting.]]\n\nThe highly restrictive environment of the Austrian court was not enough to repress Maximilian's natural openness. He was joyful, highly charismatic and able to captivate those around him with ease. Although he was a charming boy, he was also undisciplined.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=11}} He mocked his teachers and was often the instigator of pranks\u2014even including his uncle, the emperor, among his victims.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|pp=14\u201315}} Nonetheless, Maximilian was very popular. His attempts to outshine his older brother and ability to charm opened a rift with the aloof and self-contained Franz Joseph that would widen as years passed, and their close friendship in childhood would be all but forgotten.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=17}}\n\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions erupted across Europe]].

Maximilian was horrified at what he regarded as senseless brutality and openly complained about it. He would later remark, \"We call our age the Age of Enlightenment, but there are cities in Europe where, in the future, men will look back in horror and amazement at the injustice of tribunals, which in a spirit of vengeance condemned to death those whose only crime lay in wanting something different to the arbitrary rule of governments which placed themselves above the law\".{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=34}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=14}}\n\n===Marriage and life in Mexico===\n[[File:Retrato de Emperador Fernando Maximiliano I de M\u00e9xico (c. 1864).tif|thumb|250px|Emperor Fernando Maximiliano I of M\u00e9xico portrait (c. 1864).]]\n[[File:Maximilian_I_of_Mexico_portrait_standing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, circa 1857-1867.]]\n\nFerdinand Maximilian Joseph married Princess [[Carlota of Mexico|Charlotte of Belgium]], daughter of King [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], on 27 July 1857.

Like [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Archduke Friedrich]] (1821\u20131847) before him, Maximilian had a keen personal interest in the fleet, and with him the Austrian naval force gained an influential supporter from the ranks of the [[House of Habsburg|imperial family]]. This was crucial, as sea power had never been a priority of Austrian foreign policy, and the navy itself was relatively little known or supported by the public. It was only able to draw significant public attention and funds when it was actively supported by an imperial prince. As commander-in-chief, Maximilian carried out many reforms to modernise the naval forces, and was instrumental in creating the naval port at [[Trieste]] and Pola (now [[Pula]]), as well as the battle fleet with which Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] would later secure his victories. He also initiated a large-scale [[SMS Novara (1850)#Novara Expedition|scientific expedition (1857\u20131859)]] during which the frigate [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']] became the first Austrian warship to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe.\n\n===Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia===\n[[File:Schloss_miramare.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Miramare Castle]] at the beginning of the twenty-first century.]]\n\nIn his political views, Archduke Maximilian was very much influenced by the progressive ideas in vogue at the time. He had a reputation as a [[Liberalism|liberal]], and this was one of several considerations leading to his appointment as Viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia]] in February 1857. Emperor Franz Joseph had decided on the need to replace the elderly soldier [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]], to divert growing discontent amongst the Italian population through token liberalization, and to encourage a degree of personal loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|first=Victoria|last=Highes|pages=38\u201339|title=A Lurid Grandeur.

Shortly after, Austria lost control of most of its Italian possessions. Maximilian then retired to Trieste, near which he built [[Miramare Castle]].

6 July 1832 \u2013 19 June 1867) was the only monarch of the [[Second Mexican Empire]]. He was a younger brother of the [[Austrian emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. After a distinguished career in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]] as its commander, he accepted an offer by [[Napoleon III]] of France to rule Mexico, conditional on a national plebiscite in his favour. France, together with Spain and the United Kingdom, [[Second French intervention in Mexico|invaded the Mexican Republic]] in the winter of 1861, ostensibly to collect debts; the Spanish and British both withdrew the following year after negotiating agreements with Mexico's republican government, while France sought to conquer the country. Seeking to legitimize French rule, Napoleon III invited Maximilian to establish a new pro-[[Second French Empire|French]] Mexican monarchy. With the support of the French army and a group of [[Conservative Party (Mexico)|Conservative Party]] monarchists hostile to the [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberal Party]] administration of the new Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], Maximilian was offered the position of [[Emperor of Mexico]], which he accepted on 10 April 1864.<ref name=\"RoyalArk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Mexico/mexico4.htm|title=MEXICO4|website=www.royalark.net}}</ref>\n\nThe Empire managed to gain the recognition of several European powers, including Britain, Austria, and Prussia.{{sfn|Harding|1934|pp=175}} The United States however, continued to recognize Ju\u00e1rez as the legal president of Mexico. Maximilian never completely defeated the Mexican Republic; Republican forces led by Ju\u00e1rez continued to be active during Maximilian's rule. With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States (which had been too distracted by its own conflict to respond to the Europeans' 1861 invasion in what it considered to be its [[sphere of influence]]) began providing more explicit aid to Ju\u00e1rez's forces. Matters worsened for Maximilian after French armies withdrew from Mexico in 1866. The Empire collapsed, and he was captured and executed by the Mexican government, which then restored the Mexican Republic.\n\nHis wife, [[Carlota of Mexico|Charlotte of Belgium]], who had left for Europe earlier to try to build support for her husband's regime, suffered an emotional collapse after his death and apparently became insane.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[New York Times]]\n|date=March 6, 1885\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/06/102957723.pdf\n|title=Charlotte of Mexico's Misfortune}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as a boy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maximilian as a boy, 1838]]\nMaximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]], capital of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=6}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Corti|1929|p=41}} He was baptized the following day as ''Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph''.

Like [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Archduke Friedrich]] (1821\u20131847) before him, Maximilian had a keen personal interest in the fleet, and with him the Austrian naval force gained an influential supporter from the ranks of the [[House of Habsburg|imperial family]]. This was crucial, as sea power had never been a priority of Austrian foreign policy, and the navy itself was relatively little known or supported by the public. It was only able to draw significant public attention and funds when it was actively supported by an imperial prince. As commander-in-chief, Maximilian carried out many reforms to modernise the naval forces, and was instrumental in creating the naval port at [[Trieste]] and Pola (now [[Pula]]), as well as the battle fleet with which Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] would later secure his victories. He also initiated a large-scale [[SMS Novara (1850)#Novara Expedition|scientific expedition (1857\u20131859)]] during which the frigate [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']] became the first Austrian warship to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe.\n\n===Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia===\n[[File:Schloss_miramare.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Miramare Castle]] at the beginning of the twenty-first century.]]\n\nIn his political views, Archduke Maximilian was very much influenced by the progressive ideas in vogue at the time. He had a reputation as a [[Liberalism|liberal]], and this was one of several considerations leading to his appointment as Viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia]] in February 1857.

He spoke only in Spanish and gave each of his executioners a gold coin not to shoot him in the head so that his mother could see his face. His last words were, \"I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Viva Mexico, viva la independencia!\"<ref>Giving executer(s) a portion of gold/silver is well-established among European aristocracy since medieval time and not an act of desperation. In other accounts, Maximilian calmly said, \"aim well\", to the firing squad and met his death with dignity.</ref> Generals Miram\u00f3n and Mej\u00eda standing to Maximilian's right, were killed by the same volley as the emperor, fired by the fifteen-man (twenty-one in other accounts) execution party. Maximilian and Miram\u00f3n died almost immediately, the emperor calling out the single word ''hombre'', but Mej\u00eda's death was a more extended one.<ref>{{cite book|first=M.

She was first played by [[Margaret Colin]], and then by  [[Hillary B. Smith]] for six years. However the actress most recognized for the role is [[Ellen Dolan]], who played the character from 1989 until 2010, with a break from January 1993 to June 1994.\n\nMargo's storylines often focus on family dramas and police matters. The character is portrayed as a stoic, hard-nosed, determined and level-headed character, who in later years has begun interfering in the lives of her children. A pivotal storyline for the character came in 1992 when the character was raped by two criminals she was attempting to arrest during a holdup.<ref name=\"INTERVIEW: ATWT's Ellen Dolan)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/10/interview-atwts-ellen-dolan.html|title=We Love Soaps - ''www.welovesoaps.net''}}</ref> The storyline was continually re-hashed by the show in the years after.\n\nMargo's only marriage in her 30-year history on the show was with that of lawyer  [[Tom Hughes (ATWT)|Thomas \"Tom\" Hughes]]. The couple met during their investigation of Mr. Big and married in 1983. The [[super couple]] endured many trials and tribulations over their 27 years of marriage, most notably when Margo had an affair with [[Hal Munson]], and Tom cheated on Margo with [[Emily Stewart]]. For her work on the show, Dolan won [[Soap Opera Digest]]'s Outstanding Supporting Actress award in 1993, and was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy]] the same year.<ref name=\"Ellen Dolan (I) - Awards \">{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230775/awards |title=International Movie Database - ''www.imdb.com''}}</ref>\n\n[[Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery]] are also the longest married couple in US [[soap opera]] history.<ref name=\"Tom and Margo's Upcoming 25th Wedding \">{{cite web |url= http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tom-and-margos-upcoming-25th-wedding-anniversary |title= Soap Opera Digest - ''www.soapoperadigest.com'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120115030628/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tom-and-margos-upcoming-25th-wedding-anniversary |archivedate= 2012-01-15 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n==Creation and casting==\n\n===Background===\nThe character of Margo Montgomery was brought in as the daughter of Lyla Montgomery and [[John Dixon (As the World Turns)|John Dixon]]. Marrying Tom Hughes three years after her arrival, the move connected her to the core Hughes family. Margo miscarried three children with Tom and gave birth to son [[Casey Hughes]]. In the 1980s, Margo gave birth to a son [[Adam Munson]] which turned out to be the son of policeman [[Hal Munson]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe character of Margo had been with the soap since 1980 and was played by several actresses:\n\n* [[Margaret Colin]] (1980\u20131983)\n* [[Hillary B. Smith|Hillary Bailey Smith]] (1983\u20131989)\n* [[Ellen Dolan]] (1989\u20131993; 1994-2010)\n* [[Glynnis O'Connor]] (1993\u20131994)\n\nOriginating the role in 1980, [[The Edge of Night]]'s Colin stayed for two years (eventually marrying her on-screen love interest [[Justin Deas]]). In 1983, Bailey took over the role and admitted Deas didn't agree with the idea of the character being recast.<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B.

This was his way of interacting with her at work, he didn\u2019t like the idea that she wasn\u2019t there anymore.  I think I handled him the best and that\u2019s why I got the job.  Subsequently we became really good friends.\"<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B. Smith - The WLS Interview, Part One\"/> In 1989, after six years with the show, Bailey Smith quit the role, admitting she was burned out after her time on ''As the World Turns''. \"I wanted to spend more time with my kids.  I felt I had taken Margo to the length I could take her.  I needed to do something else.  Doug\u2019s feeling was, \u201cGo take a break and come back.\u201d  I said, \u201cI\u2019d loved to do that, I just need a break.\u201d<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B. Smith - The WLS Interview, Part One\"/>\n\n[[Ellen Dolan]] was offered the role of Margo Montgomery Hughes in 1989 by then head-writer Douglas Marland. Dolan said four years of [[Guiding Light]] helped her prepare for the role.\n\"I wanted her to be funny/quirky .... everything you don't get to see in her these days.\" <ref name=\"8 Questions with Ellen Dolan (Margo, 'ATWT')\">{{cite web|url=http://soaps.about.com/od/atwtinterviews/a/EllenDolan_Interview.htm|title=About.com - ''soaps.about.com''}}</ref> Dolan's first scene on the show, she revealed to [[CBS]], was aboard an airplane. \"My first storyline Casey, my husband\u2019s Casey, had some rare disease and he was going to die. And I unplugged his life support but the way they brought the character of Margo back was they brought her home, so my first scenes were on an airplane,\" Dolan recalled.<ref name=\"Interview with Ellen Dolan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/daytime/as_the_world_turns/interviews/interviews.php?sec=13|title=CBS.com - ''www.cbs.com''}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dolan said the writers never wrote the character funny and any humour there was she brought it to the show. \"Anything that\u2019s in there that brings a twinkle to anybody\u2019s eye is what I bring to it. In fact, they have to take a lot of it away. They don\u2019t let me do it a lot.\"<ref name=\"INTERVIEW: ATWT's Ellen Dolan)\"/>\n\nAfter several years of forecasting the cancellation of the 54-year-old show, Dolan's 20-year role came to an end when CBS ended the show, with the last episode airing in September 2010. When asked how she hoped her character would leave, she replied: \"I don't hope anymore.\"\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Arrival in Oakdale===\nUpon arriving in Oakdale, Margo Montgomery immediately became involved with the married James Stenbeck. When Margo confided in her friend, Jeff Ward, that James loved her and would marry her, Jeff told her she was a fool. Meanwhile, Margo was beginning continually perplexed at her mother, Lyla's, antagonism toward Dr. John Dixon and his likewise cold demeanor toward Lyla. Not long after, Margo's life changed forever during Dee Stewart's rape trial. Lyla was a witness and seemed to be protecting the accused, John Dixon. District Attorney Tom Hughes's questioning of Lyla brought out the truth: John Dixon was Margo's real father. After being exonerated, John ended up being a victim of a hit and run. John was in the hospital for a few days and started running his own investigation despite the pleas of Lt. Savage not to. John pretended that he was blind and asked to stay with Margo at the house that she lived in on the Stenbeck estate. While John was supposedly recuperating but faking his blindness, he was dismayed to find out that Margo was carrying on an affair with James. John had started to suspect that James was involved somehow with John's nemesis, Dr. Rick Ryan. John was even more convinced of this when he saw Rick and James having secret meetings. When James set up Rick to date not only Margo but also his good friend, Hayley Wilson, James started to suspect that John was investigating him. Realizing that John wasn'tblind, James threatened to kill John with a knife. However, John recorded the whole meeting on a hidden audio tape. Soon, John discovered it was James who had attempted to kill him in the hit and run. Meanwhile, Tom, who was dating Margo's Aunt Maggie, tried to convince Margo that John was faking his blindness, but Margo didn't believe him.\n\n===Relationship with her father, John Dixon===\nFinally, one day in August 1981, John tried to play the blackmail tape for Margo, but the only thing on it was music from the rock group the Rolling Stones\u2014Margo's sister, Cricket, had gotten her hands on the tape. John, however, had a duplicate tape in his safe deposit box. Margo got angry at him and told John that she was no longer his nursemaid, Later, Margo got miffed when John sought pity from his former wife Kim Andropolous and Margo's mother, Lyla. Tom had obviously made Margo suspicious of John's \"blindness\", but it wasn't enough, because although Margo ordered John out of her house, she quickly took him back. Later, learning that James was having *another* affair with a woman named Connie Wilson, Margo realized that her relationship with James was going nowhere and she ended it. It was her break-up with James that led Margo to a career in law enforcement, and she began working as an assistant for the law firm of Lowell, Colman, and Hughes for her Aunt Maggie. At the same time, Maggie and Tom started drifting away from each other. Meanwhile, one night, Margo accidentally got locked in at Fashions, Ltd. While investigating the place, that night James decided that there were too many people who suspected that he was smuggling drugs and jewels through Fashions so he decided to have it torched, while Margo was locked inside. Luckily, Margo was saved by Ernie Ross and her sister, Cricket, and all three put the fire out and saved Fashions. But as she waited for Ernie and Cricket to save her, Margo stumbled across the cache of illegal drugs and jewels. Despite her having found the evidence, Tom read Margo the riot act for almost having herself killed and he fired her. Undeterred, when Margo learned about a connection between Stenbeck and Mr. Big, Margo followed James to Paris to see what he was up to. To her surprise, Tom followed her. Soon, she spotted two thugs following James and Miranda Marlowe.\n\n===James Stenbeck===\nTo investigate the connection between James and Mr. Big, she and Tom took off for the greenhouse. The meeting started on March 4, 1982, just as Margo and Tom arrived with the FBI hot on their trail. Mr. Big accused James of being a spy and Miranda of being a traitor. Miranda pulled a gun, but Mr. Big had already removed its firing pin. Seeing the danger they were in, Tom started a fire. In the confusion, Tom and Margo managed to escape, and so did Mr. Big. Tom and Margo spotted a plane in the field, and with Margo at the controls (although not knowing how to pilot a plane), they took off. Tom and Margo were horrified to learn that Mr. Big was hiding in the back, and before he jumped, he told them the tank was almost empty since he had siphoned off the gas of his plane. Margo somehow managed to land in a deserted area. For several days in the south of France, Tom and Margo seemed lost and neither of them knew French fluently enough to ask for directions. Finally, Margo spotted a castle in a clearing. Upon entering, they found a kitchen stocked with pancake mix and brandy but the phone was dead. A sudden gust of wind slammed the door, and an unseen hand turned the key in the lock. Exhausted, Tom and Margo went to sleep, awakening to a gourmet meal. Tom wanted to run, but their path was blocked by a 400-pound mute. This silent man, whose name was Bruno (who had killed Connie Wilson back in September 1981), ushered them to the table, and to their horror, Mr. Big joined them. This was Mr. Big's castle and he was about to show Tom and Margo how horrifying it was. Mr. Big proceeded to play games with his captives. Their only escape lay in figuring out clues from classic literature. If they failed, they would die. In the \"room of love,\" (from March 17\u201319, 1982) Margo stepped on a painted heart and was shot by an arrow (with only a minor injury to her arm. Tom found the clue in a Robert Browning sonnet, and they escaped.\n\n===Entry into the police force===\nMeanwhile, Tom and Margo realized they were in love, but once they met with Bob and then flew back to Oakdale they realized they had to keep their love for one another a secret since Tom was still seeing Margo's aunt Maggie. Maggie did figure it out, but since Margo did not want to hurt her aunt, she asked Tom to cool it between the two of them. Margo also decided to become a police officer. In May 1982, she passed the police academy entrance exams, but everyone worried for her safety. The officer in charge, Captain Aaron Striker, made it clear that Margo would have to prove herself. In July, she solved one of Striker's cases, and when he tried to take the credit, Margo called his bluff. Striker wanted her dismissed, but Margo caught him in the locker room with a shapely blond officer. Striker realized she'd make one hell of a policewoman and kept her on the force. Meanwhile, Tom finally convinced Margo of his love for her, and she agreed to see him. Later, Mr. Big arrived at Margo's cottage and searched thoroughly for a hat. Margo had no idea of the hat's importance and had given Tom the band from the hat, which Tom gave to his younger half-sister, Frannie. Later, Mr. Big came back to the cottage, knife in hand, and found the hat. John finally convinced Margo that Mr. Big was in town and that he had spotted him. Margo agreed to follow John to a clearing, but at first didn't see anything and doubted her father. Just as she was getting ready to leave, Margo spotted Mr. Big with a henchman. Margo told John to lay low and not confront Mr. Big while she went to get help. John didn't listen and confronted Mr. Big. Mr. Big held a gun on John and told him to stop following him or he'd be dead. Meanwhile, Margo was duped by another tape sent to her by one of Mr. Big's henchman into going to a nightclub on Halloween evening, 1982. At the nightclub, there was a magic show. Mr. Big informed the magician that Margo would make a wonderful assistant. She was handcuffed and blindfolded and put in a box.\n\n===Kidnapped by Mr. Big===\nWhen the box was opened, Margo was gone, as was a cougar. In an isolated room away from the nightclub, Mr. Big told Margo that if she didn't tell him where the hatband was, he would release the cougar. Luckily, Tom saved Margo in the nick of time, and she told Tom about the hatband, which Frannie had left at Fashions. Miranda told Margo that Mr. Big had said something about his fortune being locked up under his hat. They found a miniature audiotape sewed into the hatband, which computer genius Ernie Ross offered to decode. The only two words they could make out were \"Bilan\" and \"Corsica.\" Miranda was shocked: Bilan was her daughter by Jacques. She was 17, and Miranda hadn't seen her in some time. After Mr. Big had killed Jacques, he had kidnapped Bilan, from a convent near Nice, France, and spirited her to his ranch in the east African island nation of Zanzibar. Mr. Big had nearly convinced Bilan that he was her biological father, which was untrue. Mr. Big was shocked to learn that Bilan knew the secrets to the fortune that he felt Jacques had kept for himself and quickly booked an airline flight to Zanzibar. Miranda feared for the daughter. Tom and Margo went to the convent in France, where Bilan was last seen. They figured out that Mr. Big had spirited Bilan to his ranch in Zanzibar. Big beat them to Zanzibar, though, and released Bilan into the care of a village of Bububu (Kiswahili's) tribe. By this time, Bilan had fallen quite ill and the priest in a nearby village church told Mr. Big where to find Bilan. Tom and Margo weren't having as much luck, but were hot on Mr. Big's trail. However, before they arrived near the village, they had to go on adventure on the Rufiji River and nearly drowned during a storm. On a nearby bank, while drying out from the storm, one evening Margo went skinny-dipping. Tom awoke and saw her, and they made love for the first time.\n\n===Mr. Big's death===\nTom and Margo met some Bububu people who were willing to tell them where Bilan was. However, Mr. Big met them and decided to kill them once and for all. Mr. Big arranged for Tom and Margo to be released into a pit of poisonous snakes that nearly killed them. But when Mr. Big left to go retrieve Bilan, Margo was able to convince the chief of the village to let Tom and Margo go. Margo had no idea that she had promised the chief to be his perfect seventh wife, in an exchange for their freedom. When the chief took Margo (his seventh wife) and Tom back to the village, Margo and Tom discovered a very ill Bilan. Margo nursed Bilan until her fever broke, but then Mr. Big kidnapped the girl, with Tom and Margo in pursuit. In a clearing tent, Mr. Big tried to get Bilan to decode the message, but Bilan was still delirious from the fever and couldn't concentrate. When Tom and Margo caught up with them, Mr. Big set fire to the tent, without Tom, Margo and Bilan realizing and there were explosives in the tent. Tom, Margo and Bilan were okay, but then Big went missing. He was presumed dead, although Margo had her doubts that Tom tried his best to relieve. Sure enough Margo was proven correct. During the village chief's wedding ceremony to a clueless Margo, Mr. Big turned up alive. He again kidnapped Bilan to get her to decode her father's message. Meanwhile, Tom and Margo swam to Big's boat. They grabbed Bilan and tried to escape, but were caught. Margo begged Mr. Big to spare Bilan. Suddenly, Bilan grabbed a hold of Mr. Big and struggled with him and threw him overboard where Mr. Big met his untimely death, when he was eaten by one of the crocodiles.\n\n===Marriage to Tom Hughes===\nAfter Tom and Margo returned to Oakdale, on January 24, 1983, they were thrown a grand surprise party by Maggie and Lyla. Tom and Margo had intended to tell Maggie about their true feelings, but when they walked into the door, Margo collapsed. Margo was taken to Memorial Hospital and it discovered that she had been bitten by a mosquito. She recovered rather quickly, but was astounded to learn that Tom had defended the woman who had supposedly killed her father John, Dee Stewart. Margo broke up with Tom and discovered that she was pregnant. Sadly, Margo miscarried the baby. Tom misinterpreted the situation and mistakenly believed that she'd had an abortion. Later Margo would take Tom back, when she learned that John was still alive. Finally, in the summer of 1983, Margo and Tom married in an impromptu ceremony in the park.\n\n===Affair with Hal and her pregnancy===\nMargo's first crisis came when Barbara Ryan decided that she wanted Tom back. She set it up so that he would believe they slept together. When Tom told Margo about the \"affair\", she planned to divorce him. Luckily, she found out that there was no affair. She and Tom reconciled and she became pregnant. However, Margo miscarried the baby. Still despondent over the miscarriage, she was crushed when Tom went to Washington DC to work on the crime commission. During Tom's absence, Margo confided in her best friend, Hal Munson. Believing her marriage was over, they began an affair. Soon after Tom returned, he and Margo decided to put their marriage back together. When Margo learned that she was pregnant (with Hal's baby) she fled the country. Tom found her in Greece and ended up delivering her son, Adam. Tom agreed to raise Adam as his own.\n\n===Birth of Casey===\nA few years later, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. At the same time, Margo's stepfather, Casey Peretti, was terminally ill and made her promise to unplug the machines that he was hooked up to. Margo fulfilled her promise, but charges were brought up against her. The charges were dropped. Margo then gave birth to a son, Casey.\n\n===Rape and Nevins break-in===\nA few years later, Margo's idyllic life would come crashing down in an instant. The night Tom, the boys, and she returned home from vacation to Cape Cod, Margo went out to pick up a bottle of Tom's favorite wine. However, she stepped right in the middle of a hold-up. Margo chased the perpetrators into a dark alley in an effort to get their license plate number. Suddenly, the men grabbed her and pulled her into a car where one of the robbers viciously raped her. Afterward, instead of dealing with her trauma, Margo put all her energies into catching the men\u2014Fickett and the man who raped her, Elroy Nevins. When both men were apprehended, the Hughes family was horrified to learn that Nevins was HIV positive. That meant that Margo could be too. Although her initial test came back negative, Margo had to wait six months for final word on her prognosis. Meanwhile, Nevins pleaded guilty to the rape but when Tom and Margo discovered that an unremorseful Nevins knew he was HIV positive, they pressed charges and tried him for attempted murder which led to a stiffer sentence. As the months went by, Tom lovingly supported Margo as she dealt with her rape. Finally, after six months the Hughes family was relieved to learn that Margo was HIV negative. The following year, Nevins escaped from prison and broke into the Hughes house to seek revenge. Tom confronted him using Margo's gun and shot him when Nevins reached for his own gun.\n\n===Return to Oakdale===\nIn the meantime, the Hughes took in Dawn Wheeler\u2014another of Nevins's victims\u2014who was HIV positive. Dawn developed a harmless crush on Tom. However, Margo didn't find it so harmless and accepted Jason Benedict's offer to come to work with the F.B.I. on special investigation into the Grimaldi family. After spending a few months in Washington DC, Margo started getting homesick and returned to Oakdale to be with Tom and the boys.\n\n===Plane crash===\nA few years later, Margo was involved in a plane crash. Following the crash, she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be institutionalized. When she returned, her relationship with Tom and her sons was somewhat strained.\n\n===Tom and Emily Stewart===\nShortly after, Margo accidentally killed Eddie Silva's mother during a drug bust. Margo felt extremely guilty and asked Eddie to stay with her family. Tom (who was having his own problems) was adamantly against this. Eddie's presence helped put a strain on their marriage. Eddie had a crush on Margo and told her so. However, unbeknownst to both, this conversation was filmed and broadcast by Emily Stewart for Tom to see in the hope that it would break up Margo and Tom. In the fall of 1998, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. Hesitant at first, she decided that having a baby might be good for them. However, Margo miscarried. The same night Margo lost her baby, Tom was having a [[one-night stand]] with Emily. When Margo found out about the affair, she threw Tom out. She relented though and took him back, only to learn that Emily was pregnant. Unable to deal with the fact that Emily was now a permanent part of their lives, Margo served Tom with separation papers. About this time, she met the mysterious Alec Wallace and became friends with him.\n\n===Renewing of her wedding vows===\nSoon, Margo found herself drawn to this complicated and brooding man. Alec intrigued Margo and when he came under investigation by the police, Margo agreed to go undercover even though she was certain that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. When evidence came forth that Alec might have been involved in several deaths, Margo was sure he was innocent and was determined to prove that everyone was wrong about Alec. Margo realized too late that she was wrong. When Margo found Alec in Tom's hospital room after he was attacked, she immediately knew that she made a mistake and was determined to send him to jail. Alec was on to her though, and drugged her. The next morning, Margo woke up with Alec dead and she had no memory of what happened. Subsequently, Margo was tried and convicted of his murder. Margo remembered who killed Alec and the conviction was overturned. Margo's greatest supporter during this crisis was Tom, who never believed that she killed Alec even when she had doubts. After a harrowing year, Tom and Margo renewed their wedding vows.\n\n===Years after===\nSince renewing her vows, Margo spent her time dealing with her siblings' various schemes and crises. She cut all ties with Katie after learning that Katie had lied about (among other things) Chris Hughes stalking her. Margo also had many an argument with Hal over his treatment of Craig. After Hal was forced to resign as chief of detectives after decking Craig, Margo inherited the position. Aside from scorn from other officers for \"stealing\" Hal's job, she had to agonize over her actions after arresting her brother for the boathouse explosion, which nearly killed Barbara.\n\n===Katie's donation===\nMargo's rape of years ago came back to haunt her when she learned that she had hepatitis C. Deathly ill, Margo's liver failed and she required a transplant. Katie was able to donate part of her liver and Margo recovered. Instead of taking a break from police work, Margo threw herself into her job and became involved in several criminal investigations.\n\n===Margo's affair===\nIn 2004, the Hughes marriage would reach another crisis with the arrival of former football star and new sports anchor for WOAK, Doc Reese. From the moment she laid eyes on him, Margo, inexplicably, found herself drawn to this man who oozed sex appeal. It soon became apparent that Doc was attracted to Margo as well and he wasted no time flirting with her, flirting that she participated in. Although her best friend, Jessica Griffin Harris, tried to warn Margo that she was playing with fire, Margo enjoyed the attention and saw nothing wrong with it. However, as the weeks went by, Margo became more and more attracted to Reese who pursued her with a passion, making her feel desirable. Soon Margo's self-control started to crumble, especially after she found herself caught in a smoldering kiss with Doc in the club's sauna. After stopping things from going too far (only because an employee at the club, Jill, walked in and interrupted), Margo couldn't stop thinking of Doc and began to consider that it might be best to sleep with him, thereby getting him out of her system. However, the night she was going to go through with it, Doc unexpectedly refused her and asked her to leave his hotel room. Doc's rejection worked like a cold shower for Margo and the next morning she confided to Jessica that she was over him.\n\nMargo's lies and distracted behavior came back to haunt her when Tom, learning she'd lied to him about working late the previous night, saw a pattern to her behavior and accused her of having an affair with Reese. Although Margo tried to tell Tom that nothing happened between her and Reese, he didn't believe her and was convinced she was holding something back. Trying to satisfy him, she admitted to the flirting but made it seem much more innocent than it actually was. Again, Tom didn't believe her. Soon, Margo found herself being blackmailed by Jill, who asked for a night with Doc in exchange for her silence. Although Margo pleaded with Doc to comply, he saw Jill as a troublemaker and refused to go through with it. True to her word, Jill went to Tom and told him about seeing Margo and Doc come out of the sauna together. Found out, Margo told Tom about the smoldering kisses she and Doc shared but insisted that nothing sexual occurred. Although he believed her, it was too late. Disgusted with the way she'd lied to him, Tom filed for a legal separation. At the same time, Margo learned that Doc did have an affair\u2014with Jessica. That knowledge put a crimp in her friendship with Jessica. However, by year's end, Margo healed her relationship with not only Jess, but Tom as well.\n\n===Dealing with Casey===\nMeanwhile, Casey was growing into quite the teenager. Unlike Adam, who was always very responsible, Casey was somewhat of a slacker. During his senior year in high school, Casey was named the father of Gwen Norbeck's baby. However, Casey denied it vehemently and, although Tom had doubts, Margo believed him. Months later, after Gwen learned that her baby had died, Casey finally owned up to his parents and admitted that Gwen had been pregnant with his child. Margo was saddened not only at losing the grandchild that she never knew she had but also at Casey's failure to own up to his responsibility. Because of his history, Margo was wary when Casey grew closer to young Maddie Coleman who ultimately became a good influence on him. In the meantime, Oakdale was saddened when Hal was killed in the line of duty. With her dear friend gone, Margo was promoted to chief of police. At the same time, Casey's irresponsibility got him into trouble again\u2014this time from gambling online. Casey racked up a huge debt and resorted to stealing from Lisa in order to pay it. However, when Casey revealed the truth to Adam, Adam convinced him to set Will Munson up for the crime. Now a music producer, Adam, unbeknownst to everyone, was obsessed with Will's wife Gwen. Finally, Casey went to his parents and confessed what he had done. Meanwhile, Adam was nowhere to be found. Several weeks later, Margo would learn that Adam was on the lam after trying to rape Gwen. Still shocked by the actions of her older son, Margo was even more saddened when Casey was sent to jail. Though her family tried to assure her that she had been a good mother, Margo frequently had doubts.\n\n===Casey's release from prison===\nEight months later, Casey was finally released. Though Tom warned her to give Casey some time to adjust, Margo immediately began peppering him with questions about his future. Soon after his arrival, Margo returned home and thought she heard Adam's voice. However, it wasn't Adam\u2014it was Casey's friend, Matt O\u2019Connor. Matt, who appeared to be a good kid, informed Margo that he met Casey at Oakdale University. Instantly taking a liking to Matt, Margo invited him into her home. As the weeks went by, Matt seemed to be a good influence on Casey\u2014especially since Casey agreed to take some courses at Oakdale U. Then one day, Margo was shocked to find a note \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you least expect it.\u201d That same night, Margo apparently got a call from Adam asking her to meet him at the church at Luther's Corner. When Margo and Tom went, it wasn't Adam they found\u2014it was Matt who'd been shot. Matt told Margo that the man who shot him was Gray Girard, his employer. Meanwhile, Alison Stewart had seen Matt in conversation with Gray various times. Suspecting that Gray was bad news, Alison took her suspicions to Casey and the two found out something startling\u2014Gray's real name was Gerald Nevins. Casey called Margo with the news and Margo realized that it could not be a coincidence. Gray must be related to her rapist.\n\n===Shooting of Gray===\nMeanwhile, Matt quickly recovered and confessed that Gray hired him to infiltrate the Hughes home. He also admitted that the Hughes had been good to him and felt remorse. Since Gray was wanted for racketeering by the FBI, Matt was supposed to be taken into custody for questioning. Instead he was kidnapped by Gray and brought to the Hughes house while Casey and Alison were there. Gray held the group hostage and forced Casey to call his mother by threatening to kill Alison. When Margo arrived, Gray held her hostage as well and revealed that he was Roy Nevins's brother. A cold Gray blamed Margo for his brother's death and told Margo that he'd waited years to get his revenge. Gray then He then set a bomb and walked out. Luckily, the bomb was defective and failed to go off. That same night, Gray snuck into the Hughes home to finish what he started. Ali returned to get her cell phone and while talking with Margo spotted Gray with a gun. Alison shoved Margo out of the way. When Tom ran down to stop Gray, he was overpowered and Margo shot Gray to keep him from killing Tom. Though Margo assured Tom and everyone that she was alright, the incident rattled Margo to the core.\n\n===Rivalry with Emily Stewart===\nMeanwhile, Casey continued to flounder without direction, which irked Margo, who kept badgering him into getting a job or going back to school. Soon, Casey found the perfect opportunity when he visited the Intruder offices and learned that Emily had fired her assistant. Casey charmed Emily into hiring him, despite Emily's concern that Margo would not approve since Margo hated Emily. Emily was right\u2014Margo did not approve and demanded that Casey quit. To keep the peace, Emily fired Casey. Casey refused to accept that and stood up to Margo. After telling Margo in no uncertain terms that she had no right butting in, Casey asked Emily for his job back. In the meantime, when Casey helped Emily investigate some stolen manuscripts from the university, he was framed. Margo refused to believe Casey's claims of innocence. Casey was quickly vindicated and although he refused to forgive Margo for doubting him, Emily convinced him to forgive her. Emily also convinced Casey to come clean when he told her about the money he stole from the Lakeview for Matt.\n\nCasey confessed the theft to Lisa who had no choice but to tell his parents. After railing at Casey for the theft, Margo told Casey that she would keep silent if he returned to school. Although a stubborn Casey refused, the alternative was returning to prison for violating his parole so Casey had no choice but to comply. Casey's friendship with Emily unnerved Margo and she finally resorted to blackmail to get Emily to stay away. Margo warned Emily that if she didn't back off Casey, she would tell Tom about Emily's recent past as a prostitute. Later, during the week of her twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Margo got a shock when she returned home unexpectedly to find Emily in a state of undress with Casey. A cold Margo immediately pulled a gun on Emily and threatened to shoot her. Tom came home and was able to defuse the situation. Appalled at the thought of Emily cavorting with Casey, Margo vindictively revealed Emily's hooker past to Tom and Casey. However, Casey knew all about it and didn't care. Not only that, but Casey defied his parents by moving out in order to remain with Emily. Rattled by the revelation of Emily's hooker past, Tom sought for full custody of Daniel. However, when Casey blasted his father for his actions, Tom ultimately backed down.\n\n===Acceptance of Casey and Emily's relationship===\nWhen it became clear that Casey would pick Emily over his family, Tom convinced a begrudging Margo that they had to accept the relationship or they risked losing their son. Soon after, Margo was horrified to learn from Casey that he and Emily had impulsively gotten married and Emily quickly denounced it as a mistake. Later, Emily collapsed and was rushed to the hospital after a confrontation with Margo. Casey became ill as well and Margo deduced that the pair had been poisoned by Rick Decker\u2014Emily intentionally and Casey indirectly. Seeing Emily's concern for Casey, Margo took her to Casey's room. Chris found an antidote to the poison and Emily and Casey made a full recovery. Having seen their devotion to each other, Tom and Margo finally accepted the relationship. However, Emily still felt uneasy about marrying Casey under the influence of Decker's drug and convinced him to get their marriage annulled.\n\n===Adam's death===\nLater, the Hughes family received word that Adam had been killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. At the same time, Riley, a mysterious young man claiming to be Adam's friend, insinuated himself into their lives. Though Margo instantly welcomed Riley into their home, Casey was suspicious. Later, after Margo was shot in the line of duty, Riley rushed to her side and called her \"mom\"\u2014revealing that he was Adam. Margo confided in Casey who confronted his brother. According to Adam, he'd been in a bombing in Afghanistan and had to have facial grafts that had changed his appearance. Adam had used the opportunity to return to Oakdale to seek forgiveness from his family. Casey was angry that Adam had lied to his family yet again, but for Margo's sake, agreed not to tell Tom. At this point, Tom became suspicious of Margo's interest in Riley and suspected that something was going on. Though Casey continually harped on Adam to tell the truth, Adam was unwilling to reveal himself. However, when Tom tried to get Riley to leave town, Margo finally confessed that Riley was Adam. After a furious Tom confronted his son, Adam turned himself in to the police. Thanks to testimony from Maddie, stating that her having buried him alive may have led to his violent behavior, and a plea of leniency from Tom, the case against Adam was dismissed. However, Adam disappointed his family again by skipping town without saying goodbye.\n\n===Swapping houses and final episode of As The World Turns===\nAfterwards, Margo concentrated on her professional life. On the personal front, things were finally looking bright for Casey when he announced that he was enrolling in law school and he was engaged to Alison Stewart. Though happy for Casey, Margo was devastated when he and Alison opted to move to Carbondale to attend school. Not knowing how to live in her home with her children gone, Margo and Katie decided to switch houses\u2014Katie would move into Margo's and Margo and Tom would make new memories in the house Katie previously shared with Brad.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery]]\n\n{{As the World Turns}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hughes, Margo}}\n[[Category:As the World Turns characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Fictional police detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| series        = As the World Turns\n| image1        = File:Margomontgomery.jpg\n| years         = 1980\u20132010\n| first         = July 1980\n| last          = September 17, 2010\n| caption1      = Ellen Dolan as Margo Hughes\n| birth         = 1955\n| age           = 56\n| alias         = Margo Montgomery\n| portrayer     = {{unbulleted list|[[Margaret Colin]] (1980\u201383)|[[Hillary B.

She was first played by [[Margaret Colin]], and then by  [[Hillary B. Smith]] for six years. However the actress most recognized for the role is [[Ellen Dolan]], who played the character from 1989 until 2010, with a break from January 1993 to June 1994.\n\nMargo's storylines often focus on family dramas and police matters. The character is portrayed as a stoic, hard-nosed, determined and level-headed character, who in later years has begun interfering in the lives of her children. A pivotal storyline for the character came in 1992 when the character was raped by two criminals she was attempting to arrest during a holdup.<ref name=\"INTERVIEW: ATWT's Ellen Dolan)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/10/interview-atwts-ellen-dolan.html|title=We Love Soaps - ''www.welovesoaps.net''}}</ref> The storyline was continually re-hashed by the show in the years after.\n\nMargo's only marriage in her 30-year history on the show was with that of lawyer  [[Tom Hughes (ATWT)|Thomas \"Tom\" Hughes]]. The couple met during their investigation of Mr. Big and married in 1983. The [[super couple]] endured many trials and tribulations over their 27 years of marriage, most notably when Margo had an affair with [[Hal Munson]], and Tom cheated on Margo with [[Emily Stewart]]. For her work on the show, Dolan won [[Soap Opera Digest]]'s Outstanding Supporting Actress award in 1993, and was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy]] the same year.<ref name=\"Ellen Dolan (I) - Awards \">{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230775/awards |title=International Movie Database - ''www.imdb.com''}}</ref>\n\n[[Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery]] are also the longest married couple in US [[soap opera]] history.<ref name=\"Tom and Margo's Upcoming 25th Wedding \">{{cite web |url= http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tom-and-margos-upcoming-25th-wedding-anniversary |title= Soap Opera Digest - ''www.soapoperadigest.com'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120115030628/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tom-and-margos-upcoming-25th-wedding-anniversary |archivedate= 2012-01-15 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n==Creation and casting==\n\n===Background===\nThe character of Margo Montgomery was brought in as the daughter of Lyla Montgomery and [[John Dixon (As the World Turns)|John Dixon]]. Marrying Tom Hughes three years after her arrival, the move connected her to the core Hughes family. Margo miscarried three children with Tom and gave birth to son [[Casey Hughes]]. In the 1980s, Margo gave birth to a son [[Adam Munson]] which turned out to be the son of policeman [[Hal Munson]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe character of Margo had been with the soap since 1980 and was played by several actresses:\n\n* [[Margaret Colin]] (1980\u20131983)\n* [[Hillary B. Smith|Hillary Bailey Smith]] (1983\u20131989)\n* [[Ellen Dolan]] (1989\u20131993; 1994-2010)\n* [[Glynnis O'Connor]] (1993\u20131994)\n\nOriginating the role in 1980, [[The Edge of Night]]'s Colin stayed for two years (eventually marrying her on-screen love interest [[Justin Deas]]). In 1983, Bailey took over the role and admitted Deas didn't agree with the idea of the character being recast.<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B.

This was his way of interacting with her at work, he didn\u2019t like the idea that she wasn\u2019t there anymore.  I think I handled him the best and that\u2019s why I got the job.  Subsequently we became really good friends.\"<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B. Smith - The WLS Interview, Part One\"/> In 1989, after six years with the show, Bailey Smith quit the role, admitting she was burned out after her time on ''As the World Turns''. \"I wanted to spend more time with my kids.  I felt I had taken Margo to the length I could take her.  I needed to do something else.  Doug\u2019s feeling was, \u201cGo take a break and come back.\u201d  I said, \u201cI\u2019d loved to do that, I just need a break.\u201d<ref name=\"Life With Hillary B.

Dolan said four years of [[Guiding Light]] helped her prepare for the role.\n\"I wanted her to be funny/quirky .... everything you don't get to see in her these days.\" <ref name=\"8 Questions with Ellen Dolan (Margo, 'ATWT')\">{{cite web|url=http://soaps.about.com/od/atwtinterviews/a/EllenDolan_Interview.htm|title=About.com - ''soaps.about.com''}}</ref> Dolan's first scene on the show, she revealed to [[CBS]], was aboard an airplane. \"My first storyline Casey, my husband\u2019s Casey, had some rare disease and he was going to die. And I unplugged his life support but the way they brought the character of Margo back was they brought her home, so my first scenes were on an airplane,\" Dolan recalled.<ref name=\"Interview with Ellen Dolan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/daytime/as_the_world_turns/interviews/interviews.php?sec=13|title=CBS.com - ''www.cbs.com''}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dolan said the writers never wrote the character funny and any humour there was she brought it to the show. \"Anything that\u2019s in there that brings a twinkle to anybody\u2019s eye is what I bring to it. In fact, they have to take a lot of it away. They don\u2019t let me do it a lot.\"<ref name=\"INTERVIEW: ATWT's Ellen Dolan)\"/>\n\nAfter several years of forecasting the cancellation of the 54-year-old show, Dolan's 20-year role came to an end when CBS ended the show, with the last episode airing in September 2010. When asked how she hoped her character would leave, she replied: \"I don't hope anymore.\"\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Arrival in Oakdale===\nUpon arriving in Oakdale, Margo Montgomery immediately became involved with the married James Stenbeck. When Margo confided in her friend, Jeff Ward, that James loved her and would marry her, Jeff told her she was a fool. Meanwhile, Margo was beginning continually perplexed at her mother, Lyla's, antagonism toward Dr. John Dixon and his likewise cold demeanor toward Lyla. Not long after, Margo's life changed forever during Dee Stewart's rape trial. Lyla was a witness and seemed to be protecting the accused, John Dixon. District Attorney Tom Hughes's questioning of Lyla brought out the truth: John Dixon was Margo's real father. After being exonerated, John ended up being a victim of a hit and run. John was in the hospital for a few days and started running his own investigation despite the pleas of Lt. Savage not to. John pretended that he was blind and asked to stay with Margo at the house that she lived in on the Stenbeck estate. While John was supposedly recuperating but faking his blindness, he was dismayed to find out that Margo was carrying on an affair with James. John had started to suspect that James was involved somehow with John's nemesis, Dr. Rick Ryan. John was even more convinced of this when he saw Rick and James having secret meetings. When James set up Rick to date not only Margo but also his good friend, Hayley Wilson, James started to suspect that John was investigating him. Realizing that John wasn'tblind, James threatened to kill John with a knife. However, John recorded the whole meeting on a hidden audio tape. Soon, John discovered it was James who had attempted to kill him in the hit and run. Meanwhile, Tom, who was dating Margo's Aunt Maggie, tried to convince Margo that John was faking his blindness, but Margo didn't believe him.\n\n===Relationship with her father, John Dixon===\nFinally, one day in August 1981, John tried to play the blackmail tape for Margo, but the only thing on it was music from the rock group the Rolling Stones\u2014Margo's sister, Cricket, had gotten her hands on the tape. John, however, had a duplicate tape in his safe deposit box. Margo got angry at him and told John that she was no longer his nursemaid, Later, Margo got miffed when John sought pity from his former wife Kim Andropolous and Margo's mother, Lyla. Tom had obviously made Margo suspicious of John's \"blindness\", but it wasn't enough, because although Margo ordered John out of her house, she quickly took him back. Later, learning that James was having *another* affair with a woman named Connie Wilson, Margo realized that her relationship with James was going nowhere and she ended it. It was her break-up with James that led Margo to a career in law enforcement, and she began working as an assistant for the law firm of Lowell, Colman, and Hughes for her Aunt Maggie. At the same time, Maggie and Tom started drifting away from each other. Meanwhile, one night, Margo accidentally got locked in at Fashions, Ltd. While investigating the place, that night James decided that there were too many people who suspected that he was smuggling drugs and jewels through Fashions so he decided to have it torched, while Margo was locked inside. Luckily, Margo was saved by Ernie Ross and her sister, Cricket, and all three put the fire out and saved Fashions. But as she waited for Ernie and Cricket to save her, Margo stumbled across the cache of illegal drugs and jewels. Despite her having found the evidence, Tom read Margo the riot act for almost having herself killed and he fired her. Undeterred, when Margo learned about a connection between Stenbeck and Mr. Big, Margo followed James to Paris to see what he was up to. To her surprise, Tom followed her. Soon, she spotted two thugs following James and Miranda Marlowe.\n\n===James Stenbeck===\nTo investigate the connection between James and Mr. Big, she and Tom took off for the greenhouse. The meeting started on March 4, 1982, just as Margo and Tom arrived with the FBI hot on their trail. Mr. Big accused James of being a spy and Miranda of being a traitor. Miranda pulled a gun, but Mr. Big had already removed its firing pin. Seeing the danger they were in, Tom started a fire. In the confusion, Tom and Margo managed to escape, and so did Mr. Big. Tom and Margo spotted a plane in the field, and with Margo at the controls (although not knowing how to pilot a plane), they took off. Tom and Margo were horrified to learn that Mr. Big was hiding in the back, and before he jumped, he told them the tank was almost empty since he had siphoned off the gas of his plane. Margo somehow managed to land in a deserted area. For several days in the south of France, Tom and Margo seemed lost and neither of them knew French fluently enough to ask for directions. Finally, Margo spotted a castle in a clearing. Upon entering, they found a kitchen stocked with pancake mix and brandy but the phone was dead. A sudden gust of wind slammed the door, and an unseen hand turned the key in the lock. Exhausted, Tom and Margo went to sleep, awakening to a gourmet meal. Tom wanted to run, but their path was blocked by a 400-pound mute. This silent man, whose name was Bruno (who had killed Connie Wilson back in September 1981), ushered them to the table, and to their horror, Mr. Big joined them. This was Mr. Big's castle and he was about to show Tom and Margo how horrifying it was. Mr. Big proceeded to play games with his captives. Their only escape lay in figuring out clues from classic literature. If they failed, they would die. In the \"room of love,\" (from March 17\u201319, 1982) Margo stepped on a painted heart and was shot by an arrow (with only a minor injury to her arm. Tom found the clue in a Robert Browning sonnet, and they escaped.\n\n===Entry into the police force===\nMeanwhile, Tom and Margo realized they were in love, but once they met with Bob and then flew back to Oakdale they realized they had to keep their love for one another a secret since Tom was still seeing Margo's aunt Maggie. Maggie did figure it out, but since Margo did not want to hurt her aunt, she asked Tom to cool it between the two of them. Margo also decided to become a police officer. In May 1982, she passed the police academy entrance exams, but everyone worried for her safety. The officer in charge, Captain Aaron Striker, made it clear that Margo would have to prove herself. In July, she solved one of Striker's cases, and when he tried to take the credit, Margo called his bluff. Striker wanted her dismissed, but Margo caught him in the locker room with a shapely blond officer. Striker realized she'd make one hell of a policewoman and kept her on the force. Meanwhile, Tom finally convinced Margo of his love for her, and she agreed to see him. Later, Mr. Big arrived at Margo's cottage and searched thoroughly for a hat. Margo had no idea of the hat's importance and had given Tom the band from the hat, which Tom gave to his younger half-sister, Frannie. Later, Mr. Big came back to the cottage, knife in hand, and found the hat. John finally convinced Margo that Mr. Big was in town and that he had spotted him. Margo agreed to follow John to a clearing, but at first didn't see anything and doubted her father. Just as she was getting ready to leave, Margo spotted Mr. Big with a henchman. Margo told John to lay low and not confront Mr. Big while she went to get help. John didn't listen and confronted Mr. Big. Mr. Big held a gun on John and told him to stop following him or he'd be dead. Meanwhile, Margo was duped by another tape sent to her by one of Mr. Big's henchman into going to a nightclub on Halloween evening, 1982. At the nightclub, there was a magic show. Mr. Big informed the magician that Margo would make a wonderful assistant. She was handcuffed and blindfolded and put in a box.\n\n===Kidnapped by Mr. Big===\nWhen the box was opened, Margo was gone, as was a cougar. In an isolated room away from the nightclub, Mr. Big told Margo that if she didn't tell him where the hatband was, he would release the cougar. Luckily, Tom saved Margo in the nick of time, and she told Tom about the hatband, which Frannie had left at Fashions. Miranda told Margo that Mr. Big had said something about his fortune being locked up under his hat. They found a miniature audiotape sewed into the hatband, which computer genius Ernie Ross offered to decode. The only two words they could make out were \"Bilan\" and \"Corsica.\" Miranda was shocked: Bilan was her daughter by Jacques. She was 17, and Miranda hadn't seen her in some time. After Mr. Big had killed Jacques, he had kidnapped Bilan, from a convent near Nice, France, and spirited her to his ranch in the east African island nation of Zanzibar. Mr. Big had nearly convinced Bilan that he was her biological father, which was untrue. Mr. Big was shocked to learn that Bilan knew the secrets to the fortune that he felt Jacques had kept for himself and quickly booked an airline flight to Zanzibar. Miranda feared for the daughter. Tom and Margo went to the convent in France, where Bilan was last seen. They figured out that Mr. Big had spirited Bilan to his ranch in Zanzibar. Big beat them to Zanzibar, though, and released Bilan into the care of a village of Bububu (Kiswahili's) tribe. By this time, Bilan had fallen quite ill and the priest in a nearby village church told Mr. Big where to find Bilan. Tom and Margo weren't having as much luck, but were hot on Mr. Big's trail. However, before they arrived near the village, they had to go on adventure on the Rufiji River and nearly drowned during a storm. On a nearby bank, while drying out from the storm, one evening Margo went skinny-dipping. Tom awoke and saw her, and they made love for the first time.\n\n===Mr. Big's death===\nTom and Margo met some Bububu people who were willing to tell them where Bilan was. However, Mr. Big met them and decided to kill them once and for all. Mr. Big arranged for Tom and Margo to be released into a pit of poisonous snakes that nearly killed them. But when Mr. Big left to go retrieve Bilan, Margo was able to convince the chief of the village to let Tom and Margo go. Margo had no idea that she had promised the chief to be his perfect seventh wife, in an exchange for their freedom. When the chief took Margo (his seventh wife) and Tom back to the village, Margo and Tom discovered a very ill Bilan. Margo nursed Bilan until her fever broke, but then Mr. Big kidnapped the girl, with Tom and Margo in pursuit. In a clearing tent, Mr. Big tried to get Bilan to decode the message, but Bilan was still delirious from the fever and couldn't concentrate. When Tom and Margo caught up with them, Mr. Big set fire to the tent, without Tom, Margo and Bilan realizing and there were explosives in the tent. Tom, Margo and Bilan were okay, but then Big went missing. He was presumed dead, although Margo had her doubts that Tom tried his best to relieve. Sure enough Margo was proven correct. During the village chief's wedding ceremony to a clueless Margo, Mr. Big turned up alive. He again kidnapped Bilan to get her to decode her father's message. Meanwhile, Tom and Margo swam to Big's boat. They grabbed Bilan and tried to escape, but were caught. Margo begged Mr. Big to spare Bilan. Suddenly, Bilan grabbed a hold of Mr. Big and struggled with him and threw him overboard where Mr. Big met his untimely death, when he was eaten by one of the crocodiles.\n\n===Marriage to Tom Hughes===\nAfter Tom and Margo returned to Oakdale, on January 24, 1983, they were thrown a grand surprise party by Maggie and Lyla. Tom and Margo had intended to tell Maggie about their true feelings, but when they walked into the door, Margo collapsed. Margo was taken to Memorial Hospital and it discovered that she had been bitten by a mosquito. She recovered rather quickly, but was astounded to learn that Tom had defended the woman who had supposedly killed her father John, Dee Stewart. Margo broke up with Tom and discovered that she was pregnant. Sadly, Margo miscarried the baby. Tom misinterpreted the situation and mistakenly believed that she'd had an abortion. Later Margo would take Tom back, when she learned that John was still alive. Finally, in the summer of 1983, Margo and Tom married in an impromptu ceremony in the park.\n\n===Affair with Hal and her pregnancy===\nMargo's first crisis came when Barbara Ryan decided that she wanted Tom back. She set it up so that he would believe they slept together. When Tom told Margo about the \"affair\", she planned to divorce him. Luckily, she found out that there was no affair. She and Tom reconciled and she became pregnant. However, Margo miscarried the baby. Still despondent over the miscarriage, she was crushed when Tom went to Washington DC to work on the crime commission. During Tom's absence, Margo confided in her best friend, Hal Munson. Believing her marriage was over, they began an affair. Soon after Tom returned, he and Margo decided to put their marriage back together. When Margo learned that she was pregnant (with Hal's baby) she fled the country. Tom found her in Greece and ended up delivering her son, Adam. Tom agreed to raise Adam as his own.\n\n===Birth of Casey===\nA few years later, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. At the same time, Margo's stepfather, Casey Peretti, was terminally ill and made her promise to unplug the machines that he was hooked up to. Margo fulfilled her promise, but charges were brought up against her. The charges were dropped. Margo then gave birth to a son, Casey.\n\n===Rape and Nevins break-in===\nA few years later, Margo's idyllic life would come crashing down in an instant. The night Tom, the boys, and she returned home from vacation to Cape Cod, Margo went out to pick up a bottle of Tom's favorite wine. However, she stepped right in the middle of a hold-up. Margo chased the perpetrators into a dark alley in an effort to get their license plate number. Suddenly, the men grabbed her and pulled her into a car where one of the robbers viciously raped her. Afterward, instead of dealing with her trauma, Margo put all her energies into catching the men\u2014Fickett and the man who raped her, Elroy Nevins. When both men were apprehended, the Hughes family was horrified to learn that Nevins was HIV positive. That meant that Margo could be too. Although her initial test came back negative, Margo had to wait six months for final word on her prognosis. Meanwhile, Nevins pleaded guilty to the rape but when Tom and Margo discovered that an unremorseful Nevins knew he was HIV positive, they pressed charges and tried him for attempted murder which led to a stiffer sentence. As the months went by, Tom lovingly supported Margo as she dealt with her rape. Finally, after six months the Hughes family was relieved to learn that Margo was HIV negative. The following year, Nevins escaped from prison and broke into the Hughes house to seek revenge. Tom confronted him using Margo's gun and shot him when Nevins reached for his own gun.\n\n===Return to Oakdale===\nIn the meantime, the Hughes took in Dawn Wheeler\u2014another of Nevins's victims\u2014who was HIV positive. Dawn developed a harmless crush on Tom. However, Margo didn't find it so harmless and accepted Jason Benedict's offer to come to work with the F.B.I. on special investigation into the Grimaldi family. After spending a few months in Washington DC, Margo started getting homesick and returned to Oakdale to be with Tom and the boys.\n\n===Plane crash===\nA few years later, Margo was involved in a plane crash. Following the crash, she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be institutionalized. When she returned, her relationship with Tom and her sons was somewhat strained.\n\n===Tom and Emily Stewart===\nShortly after, Margo accidentally killed Eddie Silva's mother during a drug bust. Margo felt extremely guilty and asked Eddie to stay with her family. Tom (who was having his own problems) was adamantly against this. Eddie's presence helped put a strain on their marriage. Eddie had a crush on Margo and told her so. However, unbeknownst to both, this conversation was filmed and broadcast by Emily Stewart for Tom to see in the hope that it would break up Margo and Tom. In the fall of 1998, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. Hesitant at first, she decided that having a baby might be good for them. However, Margo miscarried. The same night Margo lost her baby, Tom was having a [[one-night stand]] with Emily. When Margo found out about the affair, she threw Tom out. She relented though and took him back, only to learn that Emily was pregnant. Unable to deal with the fact that Emily was now a permanent part of their lives, Margo served Tom with separation papers. About this time, she met the mysterious Alec Wallace and became friends with him.\n\n===Renewing of her wedding vows===\nSoon, Margo found herself drawn to this complicated and brooding man. Alec intrigued Margo and when he came under investigation by the police, Margo agreed to go undercover even though she was certain that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. When evidence came forth that Alec might have been involved in several deaths, Margo was sure he was innocent and was determined to prove that everyone was wrong about Alec. Margo realized too late that she was wrong. When Margo found Alec in Tom's hospital room after he was attacked, she immediately knew that she made a mistake and was determined to send him to jail. Alec was on to her though, and drugged her. The next morning, Margo woke up with Alec dead and she had no memory of what happened. Subsequently, Margo was tried and convicted of his murder. Margo remembered who killed Alec and the conviction was overturned. Margo's greatest supporter during this crisis was Tom, who never believed that she killed Alec even when she had doubts. After a harrowing year, Tom and Margo renewed their wedding vows.\n\n===Years after===\nSince renewing her vows, Margo spent her time dealing with her siblings' various schemes and crises. She cut all ties with Katie after learning that Katie had lied about (among other things) Chris Hughes stalking her. Margo also had many an argument with Hal over his treatment of Craig. After Hal was forced to resign as chief of detectives after decking Craig, Margo inherited the position. Aside from scorn from other officers for \"stealing\" Hal's job, she had to agonize over her actions after arresting her brother for the boathouse explosion, which nearly killed Barbara.\n\n===Katie's donation===\nMargo's rape of years ago came back to haunt her when she learned that she had hepatitis C. Deathly ill, Margo's liver failed and she required a transplant. Katie was able to donate part of her liver and Margo recovered. Instead of taking a break from police work, Margo threw herself into her job and became involved in several criminal investigations.\n\n===Margo's affair===\nIn 2004, the Hughes marriage would reach another crisis with the arrival of former football star and new sports anchor for WOAK, Doc Reese. From the moment she laid eyes on him, Margo, inexplicably, found herself drawn to this man who oozed sex appeal. It soon became apparent that Doc was attracted to Margo as well and he wasted no time flirting with her, flirting that she participated in. Although her best friend, Jessica Griffin Harris, tried to warn Margo that she was playing with fire, Margo enjoyed the attention and saw nothing wrong with it. However, as the weeks went by, Margo became more and more attracted to Reese who pursued her with a passion, making her feel desirable. Soon Margo's self-control started to crumble, especially after she found herself caught in a smoldering kiss with Doc in the club's sauna. After stopping things from going too far (only because an employee at the club, Jill, walked in and interrupted), Margo couldn't stop thinking of Doc and began to consider that it might be best to sleep with him, thereby getting him out of her system. However, the night she was going to go through with it, Doc unexpectedly refused her and asked her to leave his hotel room. Doc's rejection worked like a cold shower for Margo and the next morning she confided to Jessica that she was over him.\n\nMargo's lies and distracted behavior came back to haunt her when Tom, learning she'd lied to him about working late the previous night, saw a pattern to her behavior and accused her of having an affair with Reese. Although Margo tried to tell Tom that nothing happened between her and Reese, he didn't believe her and was convinced she was holding something back. Trying to satisfy him, she admitted to the flirting but made it seem much more innocent than it actually was. Again, Tom didn't believe her. Soon, Margo found herself being blackmailed by Jill, who asked for a night with Doc in exchange for her silence. Although Margo pleaded with Doc to comply, he saw Jill as a troublemaker and refused to go through with it. True to her word, Jill went to Tom and told him about seeing Margo and Doc come out of the sauna together. Found out, Margo told Tom about the smoldering kisses she and Doc shared but insisted that nothing sexual occurred. Although he believed her, it was too late. Disgusted with the way she'd lied to him, Tom filed for a legal separation. At the same time, Margo learned that Doc did have an affair\u2014with Jessica. That knowledge put a crimp in her friendship with Jessica. However, by year's end, Margo healed her relationship with not only Jess, but Tom as well.\n\n===Dealing with Casey===\nMeanwhile, Casey was growing into quite the teenager. Unlike Adam, who was always very responsible, Casey was somewhat of a slacker. During his senior year in high school, Casey was named the father of Gwen Norbeck's baby. However, Casey denied it vehemently and, although Tom had doubts, Margo believed him. Months later, after Gwen learned that her baby had died, Casey finally owned up to his parents and admitted that Gwen had been pregnant with his child. Margo was saddened not only at losing the grandchild that she never knew she had but also at Casey's failure to own up to his responsibility. Because of his history, Margo was wary when Casey grew closer to young Maddie Coleman who ultimately became a good influence on him. In the meantime, Oakdale was saddened when Hal was killed in the line of duty. With her dear friend gone, Margo was promoted to chief of police. At the same time, Casey's irresponsibility got him into trouble again\u2014this time from gambling online. Casey racked up a huge debt and resorted to stealing from Lisa in order to pay it. However, when Casey revealed the truth to Adam, Adam convinced him to set Will Munson up for the crime. Now a music producer, Adam, unbeknownst to everyone, was obsessed with Will's wife Gwen. Finally, Casey went to his parents and confessed what he had done. Meanwhile, Adam was nowhere to be found. Several weeks later, Margo would learn that Adam was on the lam after trying to rape Gwen. Still shocked by the actions of her older son, Margo was even more saddened when Casey was sent to jail. Though her family tried to assure her that she had been a good mother, Margo frequently had doubts.\n\n===Casey's release from prison===\nEight months later, Casey was finally released. Though Tom warned her to give Casey some time to adjust, Margo immediately began peppering him with questions about his future. Soon after his arrival, Margo returned home and thought she heard Adam's voice. However, it wasn\u2019t Adam\u2014it was Casey's friend, Matt O\u2019Connor. Matt, who appeared to be a good kid, informed Margo that he met Casey at Oakdale University. Instantly taking a liking to Matt, Margo invited him into her home. As the weeks went by, Matt seemed to be a good influence on Casey\u2014especially since Casey agreed to take some courses at Oakdale U. Then one day, Margo was shocked to find a note \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you least expect it.\u201d That same night, Margo apparently got a call from Adam asking her to meet him at the church at Luther's Corner. When Margo and Tom went, it wasn\u2019t Adam they found\u2014it was Matt who\u2019d been shot. Matt told Margo that the man who shot him was Gray Girard, his employer. Meanwhile, Alison Stewart had seen Matt in conversation with Gray various times. Suspecting that Gray was bad news, Alison took her suspicions to Casey and the two found out something startling\u2014Gray's real name was Gerald Nevins. Casey called Margo with the news and Margo realized that it could not be a coincidence. Gray must be related to her rapist.\n\n===Shooting of Gray===\nMeanwhile, Matt quickly recovered and confessed that Gray hired him to infiltrate the Hughes home. He also admitted that the Hughes had been good to him and felt remorse. Since Gray was wanted for racketeering by the FBI, Matt was supposed to be taken into custody for questioning. Instead he was kidnapped by Gray and brought to the Hughes house while Casey and Alison were there. Gray held the group hostage and forced Casey to call his mother by threatening to kill Alison. When Margo arrived, Gray held her hostage as well and revealed that he was Roy Nevins's brother. A cold Gray blamed Margo for his brother's death and told Margo that he\u2019d waited years to get his revenge. Gray then He then set a bomb and walked out. Luckily, the bomb was defective and failed to go off. That same night, Gray snuck into the Hughes home to finish what he started. Ali returned to get her cell phone and while talking with Margo spotted Gray with a gun. Alison shoved Margo out of the way. When Tom ran down to stop Gray, he was overpowered and Margo shot Gray to keep him from killing Tom. Though Margo assured Tom and everyone that she was alright, the incident rattled Margo to the core.\n\n===Rivalry with Emily Stewart===\nMeanwhile, Casey continued to flounder without direction, which irked Margo, who kept badgering him into getting a job or going back to school. Soon, Casey found the perfect opportunity when he visited the Intruder offices and learned that Emily had fired her assistant. Casey charmed Emily into hiring him, despite Emily's concern that Margo would not approve since Margo hated Emily. Emily was right\u2014Margo did not approve and demanded that Casey quit. To keep the peace, Emily fired Casey. Casey refused to accept that and stood up to Margo. After telling Margo in no uncertain terms that she had no right butting in, Casey asked Emily for his job back. In the meantime, when Casey helped Emily investigate some stolen manuscripts from the university, he was framed. Margo refused to believe Casey's claims of innocence. Casey was quickly vindicated and although he refused to forgive Margo for doubting him, Emily convinced him to forgive her. Emily also convinced Casey to come clean when he told her about the money he stole from the Lakeview for Matt.\n\nCasey confessed the theft to Lisa who had no choice but to tell his parents. After railing at Casey for the theft, Margo told Casey that she would keep silent if he returned to school. Although a stubborn Casey refused, the alternative was returning to prison for violating his parole so Casey had no choice but to comply. Casey's friendship with Emily unnerved Margo and she finally resorted to blackmail to get Emily to stay away. Margo warned Emily that if she didn\u2019t back off Casey, she would tell Tom about Emily's recent past as a prostitute. Later, during the week of her twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Margo got a shock when she returned home unexpectedly to find Emily in a state of undress with Casey. A cold Margo immediately pulled a gun on Emily and threatened to shoot her. Tom came home and was able to defuse the situation. Appalled at the thought of Emily cavorting with Casey, Margo vindictively revealed Emily's hooker past to Tom and Casey. However, Casey knew all about it and didn\u2019t care. Not only that, but Casey defied his parents by moving out in order to remain with Emily. Rattled by the revelation of Emily's hooker past, Tom sought for full custody of Daniel. However, when Casey blasted his father for his actions, Tom ultimately backed down.\n\n===Acceptance of Casey and Emily's relationship===\nWhen it became clear that Casey would pick Emily over his family, Tom convinced a begrudging Margo that they had to accept the relationship or they risked losing their son. Soon after, Margo was horrified to learn from Casey that he and Emily had impulsively gotten married and Emily quickly denounced it as a mistake. Later, Emily collapsed and was rushed to the hospital after a confrontation with Margo. Casey became ill as well and Margo deduced that the pair had been poisoned by Rick Decker\u2014Emily intentionally and Casey indirectly. Seeing Emily's concern for Casey, Margo took her to Casey's room. Chris found an antidote to the poison and Emily and Casey made a full recovery. Having seen their devotion to each other, Tom and Margo finally accepted the relationship. However, Emily still felt uneasy about marrying Casey under the influence of Decker's drug and convinced him to get their marriage annulled.\n\n===Adam's death===\nLater, the Hughes family received word that Adam had been killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. At the same time, Riley, a mysterious young man claiming to be Adam's friend, insinuated himself into their lives. Though Margo instantly welcomed Riley into their home, Casey was suspicious. Later, after Margo was shot in the line of duty, Riley rushed to her side and called her \"mom\"\u2014revealing that he was Adam. Margo confided in Casey who confronted his brother. According to Adam, he'd been in a bombing in Afghanistan and had to have facial grafts that had changed his appearance. Adam had used the opportunity to return to Oakdale to seek forgiveness from his family. Casey was angry that Adam had lied to his family yet again, but for Margo's sake, agreed not to tell Tom. At this point, Tom became suspicious of Margo's interest in Riley and suspected that something was going on. Though Casey continually harped on Adam to tell the truth, Adam was unwilling to reveal himself. However, when Tom tried to get Riley to leave town, Margo finally confessed that Riley was Adam. After a furious Tom confronted his son, Adam turned himself in to the police. Thanks to testimony from Maddie, stating that her having buried him alive may have led to his violent behavior, and a plea of leniency from Tom, the case against Adam was dismissed. However, Adam disappointed his family again by skipping town without saying goodbye.\n\n===Swapping houses and final episode of As The World Turns===\nAfterwards, Margo concentrated on her professional life. On the personal front, things were finally looking bright for Casey when he announced that he was enrolling in law school and he was engaged to Alison Stewart. Though happy for Casey, Margo was devastated when he and Alison opted to move to Carbondale to attend school. Not knowing how to live in her home with her children gone, Margo and Katie decided to switch houses\u2014Katie would move into Margo's and Margo and Tom would make new memories in the house Katie previously shared with Brad.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery]]\n\n{{As the World Turns}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hughes, Margo}}\n[[Category:As the World Turns characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Fictional police detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: wasn\u2019t \u2192 wasn't (4), he\u2019d \u2192 he'd, who\u2019d \u2192 who'd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margo_Hughes"}

The CLP had governed since the [[1974 Northern Territory general election|initial 1974 election]] until Labor led by [[Clare Martin]] surprisingly came to power with a one-seat [[majority government]] at the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]], mainly by sweeping Darwin's more diverse northern suburbs. Labor won in a landslide at the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], winning the second-largest majority in the Territory's history and reducing the CLP to only four seats. Although Labor led by Henderson retained a one-seat majority government at the [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]] on 13 Labor, 11 CLP, 1 independent with only 49.3 percent of the [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party preferred]] vote, Labor had won two seats uncontested by the CLP\u2014all seats were contested again at the 2012 election. Labor, the CLP, the [[Northern Territory Greens]], the [[Australia's First Nations Political Party|First Nations Political Party]] and the [[Australian Sex Party]] were running endorsed candidates.\n\nA [[minority government]] was led by Henderson from mid-2009 when [[Alison Anderson]] resigned from the Labor Party to sit as an independent member of parliament. Anderson along with the existing independent [[Gerry Wood]] signed a letter to the speaker of parliament to push sittings forward, prompting CLP leader Mills to table a [[motion of no confidence]] on Monday 10 August 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2009/08/07/73421_ntnews.html |title=D-Day brought forward |work=Northern Territory News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/07/2649483.htm |title=NT Labor may be ousted next week |publisher=ABC News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/labors-fate-uncertain-20090810-efl9.html |title=Labor's fate uncertain |work=The Age |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Wood ended up voting with the government, defeating the motion of no confidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25927928-5006790,00.html |title=Labor survives D-day in NT showdown |work=The Australian |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Anderson joined the CLP in September 2011, resulting in 12 Labor, 12 CLP, 1 independent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/09/09/259011_ntnews.html |title=Anderson 'mates' with an old enemy |work=Northern Territory News |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> Wood and Anderson retained their seats at the 2012 election.\n\nIn October 2010, former CLP leader [[Jodeen Carney]] resigned in her seat, an [[2010 Araluen by-election|Araluen by-election]] was held, the CLP retained the seat but suffered a 6.6-point [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party preferred]] swing.\n\n== Method ==\nLike the [[Australian House of Representatives]], members were elected through full-preference [[instant-runoff voting]] in [[single-member electorates]]. The election was conducted by the Northern Territory Electoral Commission, an independent body answerable to Parliament.\n\nIn a change to polling in remote electorates, where most voting was previously conducted by mobile polling teams, for the first time there was full election day voting in major regional indigenous centres. As such, swings may be distorted. The conducting of a formal polling place could also alter the way voting takes places and increase the local turnout. Mobile polling teams were still used but they took many fewer votes than in the past. In addition, for the first time in the territory, there was an electronic feed of results, the last administration in Australia to go electronic.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/08/2012-nt-election-how-to-follow-the-abc-coverage-on-saturday-night-.html |title = Antony Green|date = 11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Date ==\nThe Henderson Labor government introduced fixed four-year terms following the previous election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2009/08/fixed-term-parliaments-face-test-in-northern-territory.html |title=Fixed Term Parliaments face test in Northern Territory |publisher=ABC News |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Legislative Assembly was dissolved on 6 August 2012.

The CLP had governed since the [[1974 Northern Territory general election|initial 1974 election]] until Labor led by [[Clare Martin]] surprisingly came to power with a one-seat [[majority government]] at the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]], mainly by sweeping Darwin's more diverse northern suburbs. Labor won in a landslide at the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], winning the second-largest majority in the Territory's history and reducing the CLP to only four seats. Although Labor led by Henderson retained a one-seat majority government at the [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]] on 13 Labor, 11 CLP, 1 independent with only 49.3 percent of the [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party preferred]] vote, Labor had won two seats uncontested by the CLP\u2014all seats were contested again at the 2012 election. Labor, the CLP, the [[Northern Territory Greens]], the [[Australia's First Nations Political Party|First Nations Political Party]] and the [[Australian Sex Party]] were running endorsed candidates.\n\nA [[minority government]] was led by Henderson from mid-2009 when [[Alison Anderson]] resigned from the Labor Party to sit as an independent member of parliament. Anderson along with the existing independent [[Gerry Wood]] signed a letter to the speaker of parliament to push sittings forward, prompting CLP leader Mills to table a [[motion of no confidence]] on Monday 10 August 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2009/08/07/73421_ntnews.html |title=D-Day brought forward |work=Northern Territory News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/07/2649483.htm |title=NT Labor may be ousted next week |publisher=ABC News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/labors-fate-uncertain-20090810-efl9.html |title=Labor's fate uncertain |work=The Age |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Wood ended up voting with the government, defeating the motion of no confidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25927928-5006790,00.html |title=Labor survives D-day in NT showdown |work=The Australian |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Anderson joined the CLP in September 2011, resulting in 12 Labor, 12 CLP, 1 independent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/09/09/259011_ntnews.html |title=Anderson 'mates' with an old enemy |work=Northern Territory News |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> Wood and Anderson retained their seats at the 2012 election.\n\nIn October 2010, former CLP leader [[Jodeen Carney]] resigned in her seat, an [[2010 Araluen by-election|Araluen by-election]] was held, the CLP retained the seat but suffered a 6.6-point [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party preferred]] swing.\n\n== Method ==\nLike the [[Australian House of Representatives]], members were elected through full-preference [[instant-runoff voting]] in [[single-member electorates]]. The election was conducted by the Northern Territory Electoral Commission, an independent body answerable to Parliament.\n\nIn a change to polling in remote electorates, where most voting was previously conducted by mobile polling teams, for the first time there was full election day voting in major regional indigenous centres. As such, swings may be distorted. The conducting of a formal polling place could also alter the way voting takes places and increase the local turnout.

Aircraft in the series include the '''ERJ135''' (37 passengers), '''ERJ140''' (44 passengers), and '''ERJ145''' (50 passengers), as well as the [[Embraer Legacy 600|Legacy]] business jet and the [[Embraer R-99|R-99]] family of military aircraft. Each jet in the series is powered by two [[turbofan]] engines. The family's primary competition comes from the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Bombardier CRJ|CRJ regional jets]].\n\n==Development==\n\nThe ERJ145 was designed for a perceived new market for regional jet aircraft, where the increased speed, comfort and passenger appeal would outweigh the inherent fuel economy of the turboprop aircraft which were in service and in development.<ref name=resende>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1678-58782004000400004&script=sci_arttext Resende, O.C.

All three aircraft share the same crew [[type rating]], allowing pilots to fly any of the three aircraft without the need for further training.\n\nThe ERJ140 is {{Convert|1.42|m|ft}} shorter, seating 44 passengers, and has 96% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The only significant changes are a shorter [[fuselage]], a slightly [[Derating|derated]] engine and an increased range. The ERJ140 was designed with fewer seats in order to meet the needs of some major [[United States]] airlines, which have an agreement with the pilots' union to limit the number of 50-seat aircraft that can be flown by their affiliates. At launch, Embraer estimated the cost of an ERJ140 to be approximately US $15.2 million. The estimated cost of development of the ERJ140 was US $45 million.\n\nThe ERJ135 is {{Convert|3.54|m|ft}} shorter, seating 37 passengers, and has 95% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The first ERJ135 entered service in 1999.\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[airframe]] is mainly stretched, machined and [[Chemical milling|chemically milled]] aluminium, with [[Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic|CFRP]] for moving parts, [[Glass fiber reinforced plastic|GFRP]] for fairings and sidewalls, [[kevlar]] for leading edges and [[Nomex]] honeycomb-CFRP/GFRP sandwiches for floors.<ref name=Flight18oct1995/>\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe EMB145 family of aircraft generally come equipped with two [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]] series [[turbofan]] engines. The engines have a [[bypass ratio]] of 5:1. The engines are controlled by two [[FADEC]]s (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls). The FADECs control virtually all aspects of the engine and send engine data to be displayed on the [[EICAS]] for the pilot.\n\n=== Avionics ===\n[[File:Embraer 135BJ flight deck.jpg|right|thumb|Flight deck]]\n\nThe Embraer ERJ145 family of aircraft typically comes equipped with the [[Honeywell Primus|Honeywell Primus 1000]] [[avionics]] suite. The suite normally consists of five CRT display units (DUs) or screens. From left to right, the system consists of a Primary Flight Display (PFD), Multi-Function Display (MFD), Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS), Multi-Function Display (MFD) (Co-pilot) and Primary Flight Display (PFD) (Co-pilot). The DUs are normally CRTs but can be upgraded to lighter LCD displays. These upgraded DUs also have added functionality.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Embraer ERJ-145LR, United Express (ExpressJet Airlines) JP7008157.jpg|thumb|ERJ-145 operated for United Express by ExpressJet Airlines at Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico]]\n\nThe first delivery was in December 1996 to [[ExpressJet Airlines]] (then the regional division of [[Continental Airlines]] flying as [[Continental Express]]).  ExpressJet is the largest operator of the ERJ145, with 270 of the nearly-1,000 ERJ145s in service.  The second largest operator is [[Envoy Air]], with 206 ERJ145 aircraft. [[Piedmont Airlines]] also operates 60 ERJ145s through an alliance with [[American Airlines]].\n\nThe ERJ140 was introduced in September 1999, first flew on June 27, 2000 and entered commercial service in July 2001.

February 2011 Embraer presented its new EMB-145 AEW&C for India.\n\nDespite the multiple variants, pilots need only one [[type rating]] to fly any variant of the ERJ aircraft. Companies like American Eagle and ExpressJet Airlines utilize this benefit with their mixed fleet of ERJ135ER/LR and ERJ145EP/LR/XR. Shared type ratings allows operators to utilize a single pilot pool for any ERJ aircraft.\n\n===Military models===\n* '''C-99A''' \u2013 Transport model\n* '''EMB 145SA''' ([[Embraer R-99|R-99A]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n* '''EMB 145RS''' ([[Embraer R-99|R-99B]]) \u2013 Remote sensing model\n* '''EMB 145MP/ASW''' ([[Embraer R-99|P-99]]) \u2013 Maritime patrol model\n* '''EMB 145H''' ([[Hellenic Air Force]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n* '''EMB 145I''' ([[Indian Air Force]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Civilian operators===\n[[File:N11187 (2767181410).jpg|thumb|[[ExpressJet Airlines]], operating as United Express, is the largest operator]]\n\nAs of October 2019, the main civilian operators are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/operators/Embraer/ERJ-145?p=1&amp;refresh=1|title=Embraer ERJ-145 Operators|website=www.planespotters.net|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Envoy Air]]: 108\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[ExpressJet Airlines]]: 96\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Piedmont Airlines]]: 60\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[CommutAir]]: 36\n*{{Flagicon|South Africa}} [[Airlink]]: 28\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[AeroVision International]]: 24\n*{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Loganair]]: 17\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Air Hamburg]]: 16\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[JSX (airline)|JSX]]: 24\n*{{Flagicon|France}} [[Air France Hop]]: 14\n*{{Flagicon|France}} [[:fr:Amelia (by Regourd Aviation)|Amelia (by Regourd Aviation)]]: 11\n*{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[TAR Aerolineas]]: 12\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Contour Airlines]]: 11<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hmgaerospace.com/news/lara/contour-acquires-five-erj-135/ | title=Contour acquires five ERJ-135| date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Ghana}} [[Africa World Airlines]]: 8\n*{{Flagicon|Nigeria}} [[Air Peace|Air Peace Hopper]]: 6\n*{{Flagicon|Ethiopia}} [[National Airways Ethiopia]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Bahamas}} [[Western Air]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Namibia}} [[Air Namibia]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[Calafia Airlines]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Kazakhstan}} [[Comlux]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Premiair]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Malta}} [[AirX Charter]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Equatorial Guinea}} [[Cronos Airlines]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Zimbabwe}} [[Fastjet Zimbabwe]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|South Korea}} [[Korea Express Air]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Turks and Caicos Islands}} [[interCaribbean Airways]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[Star Air (India)|Star Air]] : 2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/indian-start-up-star-air-to-expand-erj-145-fleet-460584/|title=Indian start-up Star Air to expand ERJ-145 fleet|last=Kaminski-Morrow|first=David|date=2019-08-30|website=Flightglobal.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Mongolia}} [[Aero Mongolia]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|Myanmar}} [[Air Mandalay]]: 2\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Eastern Airways]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Transportes Aereos Guatemaltecos]]: 1\n\n===Military operators===\n[[File:EGVA - Embraer 145SA - Hellenic Air Force - 729 (30186004888).jpg|thumb|[[Erieye]] variant (R-99A) of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] with an [[active electronically scanned array|AESA]] antenna on top for [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AEW&C]]]]\n[[File:Embraer R-99 6750 (9505743118).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer R-99]]B variant of the [[For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Brasileira]] with a [[synthetic aperture radar]] on the side]]\n[[File:EMB-145 FAM 3.jpg|thumb|EMB 145 MP maritime patrol version of the [[Fuerza A\u00e9rea Mexicana]], without the R-99B side radar]]\n\n;{{Flagicon|Angola}} [[Angola]]\n* [[Angolan Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Belgium}} [[Belgium]]\n* [[Belgian Air Component]] (operates two ERJ135 and two ERJ145 since 2001 in passenger transport and VIP roles)\n;{{Flagicon|Brazil}} [[Brazil]]\n* [[Brazilian Air Force]]\n* [[Brazil Federal Police]]\n;{{Flagicon|Colombia}} [[Colombia]]\n* [[Colombian Air Force]]\n* [[SATENA]]\n;{{Flagicon|Ecuador}} [[Ecuador]]\n* [[Ecuadorian Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Greece}} [[Greece]]\n* [[Hellenic Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n* [[Indian Air Force]] (Operates 3 ERJ135 as VIP transport and ERJ145 as AEW&CS)\n* [[Border Security Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[Mexico]]\n* [[Mexican Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Panama}} [[Panama]]\n*[[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Presidential Air Guard]]\n\n;{{Flagicon|Thailand}} [[Thailand]]\n* [[Royal Thai Army]]\n* [[Royal Thai Navy]]<ref name=\"Embraer5Nov2007PressRelease\">{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

Aircraft in the series include the '''ERJ135''' (37 passengers), '''ERJ140''' (44 passengers), and '''ERJ145''' (50 passengers), as well as the [[Embraer Legacy 600|Legacy]] business jet and the [[Embraer R-99|R-99]] family of military aircraft. Each jet in the series is powered by two [[turbofan]] engines. The family's primary competition comes from the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Bombardier CRJ|CRJ regional jets]].\n\n==Development==\n\nThe ERJ145 was designed for a perceived new market for regional jet aircraft, where the increased speed, comfort and passenger appeal would outweigh the inherent fuel economy of the turboprop aircraft which were in service and in development.<ref name=resende>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1678-58782004000400004&script=sci_arttext Resende, O.C.

All three aircraft share the same crew [[type rating]], allowing pilots to fly any of the three aircraft without the need for further training.\n\nThe ERJ140 is {{Convert|1.42|m|ft}} shorter, seating 44 passengers, and has 96% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The only significant changes are a shorter [[fuselage]], a slightly [[Derating|derated]] engine and an increased range. The ERJ140 was designed with fewer seats in order to meet the needs of some major [[United States]] airlines, which have an agreement with the pilots' union to limit the number of 50-seat aircraft that can be flown by their affiliates. At launch, Embraer estimated the cost of an ERJ140 to be approximately US $15.2 million. The estimated cost of development of the ERJ140 was US $45 million.\n\nThe ERJ135 is {{Convert|3.54|m|ft}} shorter, seating 37 passengers, and has 95% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The first ERJ135 entered service in 1999.\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[airframe]] is mainly stretched, machined and [[Chemical milling|chemically milled]] aluminium, with [[Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic|CFRP]] for moving parts, [[Glass fiber reinforced plastic|GFRP]] for fairings and sidewalls, [[kevlar]] for leading edges and [[Nomex]] honeycomb-CFRP/GFRP sandwiches for floors.<ref name=Flight18oct1995/>\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe EMB145 family of aircraft generally come equipped with two [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]] series [[turbofan]] engines. The engines have a [[bypass ratio]] of 5:1. The engines are controlled by two [[FADEC]]s (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls). The FADECs control virtually all aspects of the engine and send engine data to be displayed on the [[EICAS]] for the pilot.\n\n=== Avionics ===\n[[File:Embraer 135BJ flight deck.jpg|right|thumb|Flight deck]]\n\nThe Embraer ERJ145 family of aircraft typically comes equipped with the [[Honeywell Primus|Honeywell Primus 1000]] [[avionics]] suite. The suite normally consists of five CRT display units (DUs) or screens. From left to right, the system consists of a Primary Flight Display (PFD), Multi-Function Display (MFD), Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS), Multi-Function Display (MFD) (Co-pilot) and Primary Flight Display (PFD) (Co-pilot). The DUs are normally CRTs but can be upgraded to lighter LCD displays. These upgraded DUs also have added functionality.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Embraer ERJ-145LR, United Express (ExpressJet Airlines) JP7008157.jpg|thumb|ERJ-145 operated for United Express by ExpressJet Airlines at Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico]]\n\nThe first delivery was in December 1996 to [[ExpressJet Airlines]] (then the regional division of [[Continental Airlines]] flying as [[Continental Express]]).  ExpressJet is the largest operator of the ERJ145, with 270 of the nearly-1,000 ERJ145s in service.  The second largest operator is [[Envoy Air]], with 206 ERJ145 aircraft. [[Trans States]] operates 47 ERJ145s through alliances with [[United Express]] and [[Envoy Air]]. [[Piedmont Airlines]] also operates 60 ERJ145s through an alliance with [[American Airlines]].\n\nThe ERJ140 was introduced in September 1999, first flew on June 27, 2000 and entered commercial service in July 2001.

The engines are [[flat rated]] at 33.1&nbsp;kN (7,440&nbsp;lb) thrust to provide improved climb characteristics and improved cruise performance in high ambient temperatures.\n\nThe extra-long-range ERJ 145XR aircraft is equipped with Rolls-Royce AE 3007A1E engines.  The high performance engines provide lower [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] (SFC) and improved performance in hot and high conditions. The engines also yield a higher [[Flight ceiling|altitude]] for one-engine-inoperable conditions.\"<ref>[http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/erj145/ Aerospace-Technology.com ERJ145]{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=July 2016}}</ref> [[CommutAir]], [[ExpressJet]] and [[Trans States Airlines]] are the only operators of the ERJ 145XR. February 2011 Embraer presented its new EMB-145 AEW&C for India.\n\nDespite the multiple variants, pilots need only one [[type rating]] to fly any variant of the ERJ aircraft.  Companies like American Eagle and ExpressJet Airlines utilize this benefit with their mixed fleet of ERJ135ER/LR and ERJ145EP/LR/XR.  Shared type ratings allows operators to utilize a single pilot pool for any ERJ aircraft.\n\n===Military models===\n* '''C-99A''' \u2013 Transport model\n* '''EMB 145SA''' ([[Embraer R-99|R-99A]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n* '''EMB 145RS''' ([[Embraer R-99|R-99B]]) \u2013 Remote sensing model\n* '''EMB 145MP/ASW''' ([[Embraer R-99|P-99]]) \u2013 Maritime patrol model\n* '''EMB 145H''' ([[Hellenic Air Force]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n* '''EMB 145I''' ([[Indian Air Force]]) \u2013 [[Airborne Early Warning]] model\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Civilian operators===\n[[File:N11187 (2767181410).jpg|thumb|[[ExpressJet Airlines]], operating as United Express, is the largest operator]]\n\nAs of October 2019, the main civilian operators are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/operators/Embraer/ERJ-145?p=1&amp;refresh=1|title=Embraer ERJ-145 Operators|website=www.planespotters.net|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Envoy Air]]: 108\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[ExpressJet Airlines]]: 96\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Piedmont Airlines]]: 60\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Trans States Airlines]]: 46\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[CommutAir]]: 36\n*{{Flagicon|South Africa}} [[Airlink]]: 28\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[AeroVision International]]: 24\n*{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Loganair]]: 17\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Air Hamburg]]: 16\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[JSX (airline)|JSX]]: 24\n*{{Flagicon|France}} [[Air France Hop]]: 14\n*{{Flagicon|France}} [[:fr:Amelia (by Regourd Aviation)|Amelia (by Regourd Aviation)]]: 11\n*{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[TAR Aerolineas]]: 12\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Contour Airlines]]: 11<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hmgaerospace.com/news/lara/contour-acquires-five-erj-135/ | title=Contour acquires five ERJ-135| date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Ghana}} [[Africa World Airlines]]: 8\n*{{Flagicon|Nigeria}} [[Air Peace|Air Peace Hopper]]: 6\n*{{Flagicon|Ethiopia}} [[National Airways Ethiopia]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Bahamas}} [[Western Air]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Namibia}} [[Air Namibia]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[Calafia Airlines]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Kazakhstan}} [[Comlux]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Premiair]]: 4\n*{{Flagicon|Malta}} [[AirX Charter]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Equatorial Guinea}} [[Cronos Airlines]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Zimbabwe}} [[Fastjet Zimbabwe]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|South Korea}} [[Korea Express Air]]: 3\n*{{Flagicon|Turks and Caicos Islands}} [[interCaribbean Airways]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[Star Air (India)|Star Air]] : 2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/indian-start-up-star-air-to-expand-erj-145-fleet-460584/|title=Indian start-up Star Air to expand ERJ-145 fleet|last=Kaminski-Morrow|first=David|date=2019-08-30|website=Flightglobal.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Mongolia}} [[Aero Mongolia]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|Myanmar}} [[Air Mandalay]]: 2\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Eastern Airways]]: 2\n*{{Flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Transportes Aereos Guatemaltecos]]: 1\n\n===Military operators===\n[[File:EGVA - Embraer 145SA - Hellenic Air Force - 729 (30186004888).jpg|thumb|[[Erieye]] variant (R-99A) of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] with an [[active electronically scanned array|AESA]] antenna on top for [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AEW&C]]]]\n[[File:Embraer R-99 6750 (9505743118).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer R-99]]B variant of the [[For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Brasileira]] with a [[synthetic aperture radar]] on the side]]\n[[File:EMB-145 FAM 3.jpg|thumb|EMB 145 MP maritime patrol version of the [[Fuerza A\u00e9rea Mexicana]], without the R-99B side radar]]\n\n;{{Flagicon|Angola}} [[Angola]]\n* [[Angolan Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Belgium}} [[Belgium]]\n* [[Belgian Air Component]] (operates two ERJ135 and two ERJ145 since 2001 in passenger transport and VIP roles)\n;{{Flagicon|Brazil}} [[Brazil]]\n* [[Brazilian Air Force]]\n* [[Brazil Federal Police]]\n;{{Flagicon|Colombia}} [[Colombia]]\n* [[Colombian Air Force]]\n* [[SATENA]]\n;{{Flagicon|Ecuador}} [[Ecuador]]\n* [[Ecuadorian Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Greece}} [[Greece]]\n* [[Hellenic Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n* [[Indian Air Force]] (Operates 3 ERJ135 as VIP transport and ERJ145 as AEW&CS)\n* [[Border Security Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Mexico}} [[Mexico]]\n* [[Mexican Air Force]]\n;{{Flagicon|Panama}} [[Panama]]\n*[[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Presidential Air Guard]]\n\n;{{Flagicon|Thailand}} [[Thailand]]\n* [[Royal Thai Army]]\n* [[Royal Thai Navy]]<ref name=\"Embraer5Nov2007PressRelease\">{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

This was the maximum the earlier [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]] could have installed. Once loaded, TopView took back much of the memory consumed by DOS, but still not enough to satisfy industry critics. TopView ran in real mode on any [[x86 architecture|x86]] processor and could run well behaved DOS programs (i.e. programs that did not write directly to the screen but used BIOS int 10h and DOS int 21h (such as the IBM Assistant Series of productivity programs)) in an arrangement of windows.<ref name=\"prom\">{{cite news |title=IBM TopView Promising but Has Limitations |date=1985-06-17 |author-first=Lawrence J. |author-last=Magid |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-17/business/fi-12704_1_ibm-topview |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Well behaved applications would use standard DOS and BIOS function calls to access system services and hardware.

TopView was developed to run on the 8088 (and required what IBM referred to as a fixed disk) and later the 80286. TopView was not updated to make use of the [[virtual 8086 mode]] added in the [[Intel 80386]] processors that allowed better [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|virtualization]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nInitially, compatibility with the extended features was limited mainly to IBM applications, along with a few third-party products like [[WordPerfect]] and [[VolksWriter]]. A chicken-and-egg situation developed where third-party developers were reluctant to add extended feature support (such as block insert and delete to allow users to do cut/copy/paste between applications) when they did not see market demand for them.<ref name=\"prom\"/> Most DOS programs did, however, support these functions and did allow the user to perform the cut, copy, and paste operations by using the TopView pop-up menus.\n\nSome believed that IBM planned to use TopView to force them to rely on them to comply with the new technical specifications.<ref name=\"dvorak\"/>  As later versions of TopView were released, it was able to successfully make more challenging DOS apps run in a multitasking fashion by intercepting direct access to system services and hardware.\n\nTopView first introduced [[Program Information File]]s (PIF files), which defined how a given DOS program should be run in a multi-tasking environment, notably to avoid giving it unnecessary resources which could remain available to other programs. TopView's PIF files were inherited and extended by [[Quarterdeck Office Systems|Quarterdeck]]'s [[DESQview]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>[http://drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=184409042&siteSectionName=Dr. Dobb's Undocumented Corner- The PIF File Format, or, TopView (sort of) Lives!]</ref> The concept of Program Information Files was also used under [[Digital Research]] operating systems such as [[Concurrent DOS]]<!-- at least in Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386 since 1987 -->, [[Multiuser DOS]], [[Datapac System Manager]] and [[REAL/32]]; however, using the PIFED command, the necessary program information got directly embedded into the .EXE or .COM executable file.<ref>Digital Research.

By mid-1987, IBM began to shift focus away from TopView and was promoting the use of [[OS/2]] to developers and end users alike. OS/2 1.0 was a pre-emptive multitasking, multithreading OS that allowed one real mode and multiple 16-bit protected mode sessions to run at the same time on the PC/AT based 80286 and provided as a DOS alternative announced in April 1987 and made available later that December. A graphical user interface ([[Presentation Manager]]) was added with OS/2 1.1 in October 1988. 1.1 could run with or without Presentation Manager as well as an [[embedded system]] with no screen, keyboard or mouse interface required. IBM officially stopped marketing the final release of TopView, version 1.12, on 3 July 1990.<ref name=\"dvorak\"/> TopView's concept was carried forward by other DOS multitaskers, most notably Quarterdeck's [[DESQview]], which retained TopView's user interface and many features, plus added more features such as support for the special features of the 80286, 80386 and compatible processors, and, with DESQview/X (released in June 1992), a true GUI interface running on DOS. A variety of similar programs to TopView were also available, including one from [[Nathan Myhrvold#Early career|Dynamical Systems called Mondrian]], which Microsoft bought in 1986 with the stated intention of implementing TopView API compatibility into Windows which never happened.<ref>{{citation |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1986-06-30 |title=Software Makers Lean To Microsoft's Windows |author-first=Tom |author-last=Moran |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA5}}</ref> Later in April 1992, IBM introduced OS/2 2.0 which included [[virtual 8086 mode]] and full 32-bit support of the Intel 80386 superseding even DESQview and other similar environments. OS/2 2.0 was a priority based preemptive multitasking multithreading OS including 32 levels of priority (from time critical to idle time) for the 386.\n\nTopView requires IBM PC DOS versions 2.0 to 5.0 or MS-DOS 2.0 to 6.0, and will not run with later releases.\n\nKey contributors to TopView included David Morrill (the \"father of TopView\" code-named \"Orion\" once the GLASS project was moved to Boca Raton), Dennis McKinley (tasking), Ross Cook (memory management), Bob Hobbs (TopView Toolkit) and Neal Whitten (product manager). [[Bill Gates]], [[Steve Ballmer]], [[Gordon Letwin]] and other key Microsoft executives accepted an invitation from IBM executive [[Don Estridge]] to IBM Boca Raton to see a special demonstration of TopView. Gates was disturbed that Windows did not have the [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] (Windows used a [[Cooperative multitasking|cooperative]] method to share the CPU) and windowing capabilities (i.e. overlapping windows, etc.) that TopView had.  Gates witnessed TopView running multiple copies of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter running in windows (overlapping and side-by-side) in a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] fashion. Microsoft later released a multitasking version of [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)]] from what it learned from the meeting. Even though there was no joint development agreement with Microsoft for the development of TopView, Estridge asked and later told Whitten (against Whitten's and the TopView team's wishes) to turn over all source code and documentation of TopView to Microsoft. Within a short time after the meeting, Estridge's request was granted. Gates gave the code and documentation to a group headed by [[Nathan Myhrvold]]. Once the code had been modified according to Gates' specifications, he purchased the company. The product itself, Mondrian, was never released.  Gates, however, gave members of the team key positions at Microsoft. This led to a Joint Development Agreement with Microsoft (an agreement that previously only included [[DOS]]) to co-develop [[OS/2]] (an agreement that lasted until 1990). This was all done in order to satisfy the USA vs. IBM anti-trust court case that was filed in 1969. Even though it was dismissed in 1982, IBM was mired in antitrust troubles for more than a decade after the dismissal and did not recover from the legal morass until the early to mid-90s. In June 1990 an FTC probe was launched into possible collusion between Microsoft and IBM in the PC software market.\n\n==Reception==\n''InfoWorld'' in 1985 described TopView as \"bland, plain vanilla software that hogs far too much memory\".<ref name=\"fawcette19850311\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA5&pg=PA5 |title=Awaiting PC AT Clones |magazine=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1985-03-11 |access-date=2015-02-01 |author-last=Fawcette |author-first=James E. |page=5 |type=editorial}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' also criticized TopView's memory usage, but stated that \"you will find that most software written for the IBM PC is TopView-compatible\".

Gates was disturbed that Windows did not have the [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] (Windows used a [[Cooperative multitasking|cooperative]] method to share the CPU) and windowing capabilities (i.e. overlapping windows, etc.) that TopView had.  Gates witnessed TopView running multiple copies of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter running in windows (overlapping and side-by-side) in a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] fashion. Microsoft later released a multitasking version of [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)]] from what it learned from the meeting. Even though there was no joint development agreement with Microsoft for the development of TopView, Estridge asked and later told Whitten (against Whitten's and the TopView team's wishes) to turn over all source code and documentation of TopView to Microsoft. Within a short time after the meeting, Estridge's request was granted. Gates gave the code and documentation to a group headed by [[Nathan Myhrvold]]. Once the code had been modified according to Gates' specifications, he purchased the company. The product itself, Mondrian, was never released.  Gates, however, gave members of the team key positions at Microsoft. This led to a Joint Development Agreement with Microsoft (an agreement that previously only included [[DOS]]) to co-develop [[OS/2]] (an agreement that lasted until 1990). This was all done in order to satisfy the USA vs. IBM anti-trust court case that was filed in 1969. Even though it was dismissed in 1982, IBM was mired in antitrust troubles for more than a decade after the dismissal and did not recover from the legal morass until the early to mid-90s. In June 1990 an FTC probe was launched into possible collusion between Microsoft and IBM in the PC software market.\n\n==Reception==\n''InfoWorld'' in 1985 described TopView as \"bland, plain vanilla software that hogs far too much memory\".<ref name=\"fawcette19850311\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA5&pg=PA5 |title=Awaiting PC AT Clones |magazine=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1985-03-11 |access-date=2015-02-01 |author-last=Fawcette |author-first=James E. |page=5 |type=editorial}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' also criticized TopView's memory usage, but stated that \"you will find that most software written for the IBM PC is TopView-compatible\".

The workshop was also responsible for constructing the largest of the church portals, which is also decorated with Gothic stone sculpture. The tower portal contains sculptures attributed to the Romanesque sculptor [[Sigraf]]. The church has been little altered since the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval [[stained glass]] windows in the [[Nordic countries]], and its interior is also decorated by medieval wall paintings, uncovered in the 1950s. The [[altarpiece]] is from 1496, and the church also contains a [[triumphal cross]] from the same period.\n\n==Location and surroundings==\nLye Church is located {{circa}} {{convert|300|m|yd}} south of the main road between [[Hemse]] and [[Ljugarn]], on south-eastern Gotland.<ref name=kyrkomiljon>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/miljo/visaBeskrivning.raa?miljoId=21220000011736&page=beskrivning|title=Gotland kn, Lye kyrka kyrkomilj\u00f6, Gotland|publisher=Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet ([[Swedish National Heritage Board]])|language=Swedish|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> The church lies surrounded by its old [[cemetery]].

The exterior is whitewashed. A few details are made of [[brick]] and of limestone of a different colour. The portals, bases and skirtings around some of the windows are of dressed limestone, as are the corners of the chancel and tower.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}} In broad outlines, the nave and tower are Romanesque in style while the chancel is Gothic. The disproportionate aspect of the church is derived from the fact that the rebuilding of the church during the Middle Ages was never finished, hence the later and larger chancel dominates the east end of the church. The shape, not uncommon among churches on Gotland, has been compared to that of a [[pack saddle]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe tower is the most well-preserved Romanesque part of the church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=24}} On the north and south side of the first storey there are galleries accessible from inside the tower, each with two openings in the form of [[round arches]] separated by a small column. The outer [[archivolt]]s of these openings are made of alternating limestone and brick, an unusual construction material on Gotland during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=25}} The upper level contains the [[church bell]], which dates from 1650 and was made in [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=89}} There are three openings for the bell on each side of the square tower.

The workshop was also responsible for constructing the largest of the church portals, which is also decorated with Gothic stone sculpture. The tower portal contains sculptures attributed to the Romanesque sculptor [[Sigraf]]. The church has been little altered since the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval [[stained glass]] windows in the [[Nordic countries]], and its interior is also decorated by medieval wall paintings, uncovered in the 1950s.

The outer [[archivolt]]s of these openings are made of alternating limestone and brick, an unusual construction material on Gotland during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=25}} The upper level contains the [[church bell]], which dates from 1650 and was made in [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=89}} There are three openings for the bell on each side of the square tower. All of them with have round arches and each opening is divided in two by a central, wooden column.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=27}}\n\n====Portals====\n[[File:Relieve no portal da torre da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque frieze immured in the tower portal]]\n[[File:Capiteis do portal do coro da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|The western capitals of the chancel portal, depicting the Adoration of the Magi (left) and the Massacre of the Innocents]]\nThe church has four entrance portals. Three of these are [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]: the western entrance in the base of the tower, the northern entrance to the nave and the southern entrance to the nave.the chancel portal is larger and more profusely decorated.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pages=196\u2013198}} \n\nThe tower portal has a round outer arch which consists of alternating red and grey limestone; the inner arch is made of grey, roughly hewn limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} Immured as part of the southern post is a  decorated stone [[sarcophagus]], which may originally have been intended as a grave or a [[reliquary]].{{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}} It has been roughly adjusted to fit into the church wall.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} The exposed sides are decorated with figures in low [[relief]]. The short side facing the door depicts the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] enthroned while the long side, facing the exterior, depicts scenes which have been interpreted as (from left to right) two [[legendary creature]]s fighting, two [[dragon]]s or possible one dragon with two heads, a warrior with armour and weapons, and a horse.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} It has been suggested that the subject matter depicted is the story of [[Sigurd]] slaying the dragon [[Fafnir]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=14}} The reliefs date from the 12th century and have been attributed to the Romanesque artist or workshop [[Sigraf]] (''[[floruit|floruit]]'' {{circa}} 1175\u20131210){{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}<ref name=raa/>{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}\n\nThe northern portal of the nave is the smallest entrance to the church. Its round arched opening is constructed of alternating blocks of limestone and [[sandstone]]. It appears to not be original to its position and may have been removed from the earlier, demolished chancel to its present location during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}\n\nThe southern portal of the nave is constructed of alternating red and grey limestone. Its inner section consists of two pillars of convex cubic form supporting a round arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe chancel portal is the largest of the entrances, and Gothic in style. It is a comparatively richly decorated, pointed arch crowned by a [[wimperg]] made of grey and red limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=16}} The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is decorated with sculpted flowers, and the capitals of the nested columns each contain a set of sculptures with the overarching theme being the childhood of Christ. The sculpted eastern capitals show, from left to right, the [[Annunciation]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Christ]], and the [[annunciation to the shepherds]]. The western capitals contain scenes showing, from left to right, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. The wimperg above the portal depicts Christ enthroned, with one hand raised in a blessing and the other resting on a book.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=17}} The sculptures are unusually well preserved, and a few of the figures still contain faint traces of original colour (black, red, and green).{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=20}}<ref name=paint>{{cite journal |last1= Nord|first1= Anders G.|last2= Tronner|first2= Kate|date= 2014|title= F\u00e4rganalys av fem gotlandskyrkors portaler och muralm\u00e5lningar [Analyses of paint from portals and murals in five Medieval churches on Gotland]|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/7834/2014_118.pdf|journal= Fornv\u00e4nnen.

The westernmost room is the ground floor of the tower. It is a broad, [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] room that opens toward the nave with a wide arch. The nave is rectangular, with a flat, wooden ceiling. The chancel is relatively large and high, lacks an [[apse]], and has a vaulted ceiling.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30\u201331}} The nave and chancel are connected by a pointed limestone arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31}} The sacristy ceiling is supported by a [[groin vault]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30}} There are three [[niche (architecture)|niches]] in the walls of the chancel. Of the two in the northern wall, one is most probably a medieval [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] with still original doors and flanked by two immured limestone capitals, probably also made by Egypticus.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31\u201332}} The other niche on the same wall consists of three compartments and its doors probably date from the 1891 renovation.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=32\u201333}} On the same wall is the entrance to the sacristy, between a simple [[trefoil]]-shaped portal of limestone. In the church floor there are also several medieval gravestones, including one made for a local man called Jakob, who according to the inscription was killed by a cannonball while participating in a siege of [[Eric of Pomerania]] at [[Visborg|Visborg castle]] in the outskirts of [[Visby]] in 1449.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}} The walls of the church also contain a number of carvings in the surface of the wall, made in historic times. These include some pictorial, depicting among the subjects a [[Troy Town]] and 15th-century ships, as well as around 40 [[runes|runic inscriptions]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=56}} As late as 2018, an earlier unknown runic inscription was discovered in the church; although its meaning remains unclear, it may be a [[profanity]].<ref name=helagotlan>{{cite web |url= https://www.helagotland.se/kulturnoje/fult-ord-ovantat-fynd-i-kyrka-15392828.aspx|title= Fult ord ov\u00e4ntat fynd i kyrka|last= Thomsson|first= Cecilia|date= 23 December 2018|website= |publisher= Hela Gotland|access-date= 14 March 2020|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n====Wall paintings====\n{{See also|Church murals in Sweden}}\nThe interior of Lye Church is decorated with medieval wall paintings from three separate periods. The paintings were covered with layers of whitewash during the 18th century exposed and renovated during the church renovation in the 1950s.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=42}} The oldest set of paintings date from {{circa}} 1350 and decorate the chancel vault and its northern wall with large-scale figures. The paintings on the northern wall have been supplemented with other paintings from the 15th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=42\u201343}} The second set of paintings date from around 1450 and adorn the walls of both the nave and the chancel. They depict the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion of Christ]] as well as scenes from [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legends of saints]] and individual saints within frames imitating architecture. These were made by the [[Master of the Passion of Christ]] or that workshop.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=43}}{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}} The third set of paintings date from the second quarter of the 16th century and encompass two scenes on the southern wall of the nave.

The northern half of the window contains scenes from the childhood of Christ until the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], and the southern half scenes from the Passion until the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. The two windows on each side of the middle window, as well as the window in the southern wall of the chancel, contains depictions of individual saints and purely ornamental window panes.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=197}}\n\nThe windows are in a High Gothic style, the figures depicted as slim and delicate, with loose clothes and rhythmically curly hair and beards.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=198}} The overall composition is airy, with few overlaps between the different elements. The colours are dominated by the blue of the background and the red bands that separate the figures;{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=198}} the windows are comparatively paler and cooler in colour than earlier stained glass windows on Gotland.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=98}} The overall impression has been described by art historian [[Johnny Roosval]] as \"incense for the eye\".{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=46}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the glass windows were made by a workshop active in Visby.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=51}} Johnny Roosval argued that the main stylistic influences for the windows in Lye came from [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]], while {{ill|Aron Andersson|sv|Aron Andersson (konsthistoriker)}} instead argued that the main influences came from northern Germany.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=99\u2013107}}\n\n==Furnishings==\n[[File:Gotland-Lye kyrka 06.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the chancel.

She is the daughter of original characters [[Bill Horton (Days of our Lives)|Bill Horton]] and [[Laura Horton]]. Jennifer is the mother of [[Abby Deveraux|Abigail Deveraux]] and [[JJ Deveraux|Jack Deveraux, Jr. (JJ)]]<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAs Jennifer is introduced on February 9, 1976, the role was originated by child actress [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Maren Stephenson]] until August 8, 1977. For storyline purposes, the role is briefly taken over by [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Jennifer Peterson]] from December 1, 1977 to July 4, 1979, until the character was written out of the show upon completion. A main reason is that her mother, [[Laura Horton]], had been shipped off to a psychiatric facility and would not be able to care for her. Laura's exit was prompted by the fact that her portrayer, [[Rosemary Forsyth]], wanted to leave the show to pursue other things.\n\nOn October 9, 1985, the character was re-introduced with ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' actress [[Melissa Reeves]] in the role. During her time in the role she proved to be a fan favorite, and younger leading heroine. Her relationship with [[Jack Deveraux]] prompted the couple to be pronounced a supercouple for the daytime drama.<ref name=\"SOApoperadigest.com\"/> Reeves stayed with the serial until she abruptly quit on December 15, 1995, at the insistence of her husband, [[Scott Reeves]]. To replace Reeves, the show brought on [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Stephanie Cameron]] as Jennifer on December 18, 1995. Cameron portrayed the character until she was written off the show on June 5, 1998.<ref name=\"Stephanie Cameron Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/stephanie-cameron/person/22842/summary.html|title=Stephanie Cameron Bio|publisher=[[TV]].com |date= Jul 30, 2010<!-- 11:07 AM ET-->|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2000, rumors started swirling that Melissa Reeves would be returning to the show, due to the series crumbling to fill the void left by the departures of front-burner cast members [[Vivian Alamain]], played by [[Louise Sorel]] and [[Eric Brady]], played by [[Jensen Ackles]]. Her return was officially announced in April 2000. Reeves returned to work and began airing shortly after on October 6.<ref name=\"Melissa Reeves Bio\"/> After six years on the serial, Reeves departed again on September 21, 2006 to spend time with her family.

In 1985, Jennifer returns to Salem as a teenager in deep trouble who dressed in a style similar to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at the time. She has become a rebellious runaway, a compulsive liar, and is being stalked by a rapist. Her brother Dr. Mike Horton comes to her rescue. By the following year she gives up on her runaway lifestyle and moves back in with her grandparents, Tom and Alice Horton. During the summer of 1986, she begins a non-intimate romance with a high school classmate Glenn Gallagher. However, Jennifer inadvertently exposes Glenn's plan to uncover his coach's drug dealing. Jennifer trails Glenn to the park and finds the coach holding a gun to Glenn's head. Jennifer then enlists the help of classmate [[Frankie Brady]].<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> Later, when on a class trip, Jennifer and Frankie discover they have feelings for one another.  Jennifer rejects Glenn's pressure to have sex and turns to Frankie.  Together, Jennifer and Frankie foil a robbery attempt and help bust a prostitution ring.  In 1987, Jennifer's father Bill returns to Salem and tries running Jennifer's life.  Jennifer rebels by becoming engaged to Frankie; however, she breaks the engagement when she learns of her mother and grandmother's mental problems, thinking she'd develop the same problems and pass them  on to her own children. They reunite briefly, but Eve (who has a crush on Frankie) spills the beans about an affair Frankie had while separated from Jennifer.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===1989\u20132006===\nIn 1989, Jennifer becomes an intern reporter at the Salem Spectator, working under the tutelage of publisher [[Jack Deveraux]].<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> She befriends Sally, a pregnant homeless girl who gets herself arrested so she won't have her baby on the streets. But the officials won't let Sally keep her baby once it was born. Jack pretends to be Jennifer's husband, and they offer the child Hannah a foster home. Jack soon falls in love with Jennifer, but Emilio soon comes to town. Although Emilio pulls away from Jennifer when she is threatened by the gang Emilio once belonged to,<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> Jennifer soon finds herself torn between Emilio and Jack. When Jack hides his feelings for Jennifer, she then becomes engaged to Emilio. Desperate to keep Jennifer from marrying Emilio, Jack kidnaps her on her wedding day. When Jennifer escapes, she falls off a cliff and was knocked unconscious. Jack finally pours his heart out to her. Later, Jack becomes insecure about his feelings for Jennifer, so she returns to Emilio.

Jennifer believes that Lawrence thinks she is Katerina, the heiress to the Von Leuschner fortune, due to a confusion going back to when the real heiress (Carly Manning) and Jennifer were teenagers and they had switched dates.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> After a hurried wedding, Lawrence rapes Jennifer, admitting that he knew her real identity all along. Jack arrives to rescue Jennifer. Jack and Jennifer became engaged, but he calls off the wedding because he feels alienated from her. Jennifer is still unable to handle intimacy and is too ashamed to tell Jack that Lawrence raped her. Jack then marries Eve to help her get her hands on her $10 million inheritance. After Jennifer finally tells Jack the truth, she presses rape charges against Lawrence. Kimberly and Jack are able to record him confessing to the rape, and Lawrence is then sent to jail. Eve reluctantly grants Jack a divorce, and Jack and Jennifer are married. Soon after, a swindler named Hawk soon cheats them out of their money. He is caught, but the couple remains penniless. Jennifer then learns she is pregnant, but Jack's joy is not great. He thinks he is suffering a relapse of Hodgkin's disease. Though he is not ill, Jennifer goes to New York to do a TV show with Calliope. Jennifer gives birth later that year to a daughter, Abigail Johanna.<ref name=\"thequietcorner1\"/>\n\nThe following year, Abigail is diagnosed with [[Aplastic Anemia]]. Jennifer teams up with Austin Reed to find the environmental cause of Abigail's illness. It is soon revealed that Jack was the one who had allowed the toxic waste dumping and was responsible for Abigail's illness. Overwhelmed with guilt, Jack leaves Salem and Jennifer behind. Jennifer begins dating Peter Blake after Jack is gone. Peter is involved with drug trafficking at the time. Jennifer's mother Laura sees Peter with a lowlife by the name of Leo as the two of them scheme to make it appear as if Laura is having a mental relapse. Jack returns to Salem and spies on his ex-wife and her current love.<ref name=\"thequietcorner1\"/> Jennifer begins to try to find a man named Clark, who her mom had feelings for.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> It turns out that Clark is actually Jack. Jennifer is devastated and goes through with her marriage to Peter. Jack tries continuously to prove that Peter is devious but to no avail. A year later, Jennifer and Peter separate when she finds out he lied to her. Jack catches Peter with a syringe meant for Jennifer so that Peter can drug her and then take her and Abigail out of the country. Jack ends up shooting Peter, and it looks like Peter has died. (Stefano switches Peter's alive body with the dead body of an old associate wearing a Peter mask.)\n\nJack is sentenced to serving life in prison for the death of Peter, and Jennifer vows her eternal love for Jack every day. Jack breaks out of jail and takes Jen with him to evade police. They all are on the run for a while, until they join up with a circus. Jack becomes a laborer and Jen the assistant with Abby, their daughter. Abby strikes up a good friendship with the ringmaster's son. Eventually, Jack and Jennifer flee for Africa. While in Africa, Jennifer and Jack experience some problems with their relationship, especially when Jennifer falls for a young man named Colin Murphy...whom she does not realize is [[Shawn Brady]]'s nephew! She flees to Ireland with Abby, where she ends up getting herself in trouble, and then has to come back to Salem with Bo. Jack soon follows her, and the two move in together so they can look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushes Jack away and concentrates on relationships, first with Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack can't resist that certain something that has always been between them. They are remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.\n\nJack and Jennifer are just beginning to enjoy their married life together again and hosting \"In the House,\" a show that was a wedding gifts from Jennifer's father Bill to her and Jack. Jennifer is then dealt the harshest blow of her life when Jack is struck down in an alley behind Salem Place by the Salem Stalker, and Jennifer is forced to make the choice of taking him off life support and donating his organs. Abby is unable to forgive her mother until Jennifer realizes she is pregnant, but tragedy strikes again when Jennifer learns that her baby will have serious mental and physical deformities, and Lexie advises her to terminate.\n\n[[File:Missy&ty.PNG|thumb|right|[[Ty Treadway]] has played a part in Jennifer's return storyline in 2010.]]Desperate to hold on to the last part of Jack she would ever have, Jennifer refuses to terminate her pregnancy.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> With the help of her new tenant and friend, [[Patrick Lockhart]], Jennifer begins looking forward to a new life with Abby and the baby. When she is nearly full term, Jennifer gets a message on her computer, supposedly from Jack, and takes off to find him. She is picked up by a pilot who was to take her to the island of Melaswen. Unfortunately, the plane crashes, and Jennifer ends up in the jungle. She is thrilled when she reunited with Jack, and together the two begin planning a future for Jack Patrick Jr. (who is delivered by Patrick), but when they try to return to Salem, Jack is presumed dead on the return voyage. Jennifer tries to move on with her life, but finds it difficult because Abby can't forgive Jennifer for Jack's death. Jennifer is almost preparing to move on when a miracle occurs and Jack is back home for real. Together, Jack and Jennifer work on rebuilding their family, which is complete now that Abby are getting along much better with her mother. The two get a job offer for London, and Jack and Jennifer leave for London with baby Jack.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn June 2010, Jennifer returns to Salem after receiving the news that her grandmother, [[Alice Horton]], is very ill and does not have much time left. Jennifer gets to say goodbye to her \"Gram\", but is distraught as one of the closest people to her and the woman that raised her died. While in Salem, Jennifer tries to provide guidance to [[Bo and Hope]], inferring that she thinks it is best if they reconcile. She also gets to reunite with her old friend, [[Carly Manning]], who she had not seen in years. Jennifer leaves Salem after Alice's funeral and after an altercation with [[Vivian Alamain]], and returns to London to be with her family. She, however, returns to Salem in November of that same year to help Hope, who was in prison after confessing to the Salem Muggings.\n\nHope refuses to let Jennifer help her as she is determined to pay for her crimes. The women's prison that Hope is staying at, however, is trafficking human organs that came from dead inmates, and the doctor that Jennifer had been seeing at the time is helping Warden Jane and the DiMera family. After Bo helps Hope escape for the jail after being nearly beaten to death, Jennifer uses her journalism background to get a job at the prison to try and save Hope and expose the illegal scam at the prison. Warden Jane and Lee, however, discover Jennifer's true motives, and removes Jennifer's heart from her body with the intention of giving it to Dr. Walters to save a patient at the hospital. Melanie Layton and Dr. Daniel Jonas are informed of Jennifer's condition and rush to save her. Daniel ends up putting Jennifer's heart back into her chest and saves her life. This begins a flirtatious relationship between the two. Meanwhile, Jennifer's daughter Abigial, returns home to Salem to be with her mother.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Soap Opera Digest Article, Late Breaking News:Melissa Reeves Returns to Days, May 4, 2010</ref> Without hearing a word from her husband Jack, Jennifer decides it is best if she divorces Jack and moves on with her life. After the divorce is finalized and after flirting for months, Jennifer and Daniel began to date, much to the dismay of Jennifer and Daniel's good friend, Dr. Carly Manning. In July 2011, Jennifer discovered that Carly had been using drugs and had become addicted due to her life falling apart and Jennifer being with Daniel, the man she feels she wants to love. Jennifer and Daniel end up getting Carly medical help. Carly, along with her son, Nicholas, leave Salem to go to Europe.\n\nAs Jennifer and Daniel fall deeper in love, Jack unexpectedly returns to Salem. Although Jennifer and Abby are upset at his absence, he reveals that he was held prisoner in Afghanistan while covering the opium trade there, and that a British friend he had there was killed, giving him PTSD. Wanting to support him, Jennifer gets closer to Jack, and the two realize that they still love each other. Unable to make a choice between Daniel and Jack, Daniel breaks up with Jennifer and leaves Salem. Jennifer helps Abe with his campaign for mayor, though they lose to EJ DiMera. Jennifer eventually wins Jack's heart, and the two get engaged. When Daniel returns, Jennifer asks him if they can be friends, and he tells her they can, while he begins a secret romance with Nicole Walker. When the tunnels explode underneath Salem, Jack saves Abby from being trapped in a broken elevator. The elevator, with Jack inside, plunges several stories, causing Jack to die. Distraught, Abby and Jennifer scatter his ashes off the shores of northern California. Broken, Jennifer allows a pregnant Nicole to live with her, in order to keep Daniel happy and so that Victor Kiriakis doesn't have to let her live with him. Nicole reveals her relationship with Daniel, which makes Jennifer uneasy and argumentative with Nicole. Jennifer tells Nicole that she must leave after she gives birth. After Nicole sees a close moment between Daniel and Jennifer and later loses her baby, she gets in a fight with Jennifer, ending with Nicole falling down some stairs and \"miscarrying.\" Nicole blames Jennifer for the fall, but the truth is revealed that Nicole knew her baby died but was keeping it a secret so that Daniel would take her to Hawaii. Knowing that Daniel will love Jennifer and will never love Nicole, Nicole apologizes for her wrongdoings and leaves the duo alone. Daniel agrees to still be her friend, and he and Jennifer forgive her, not pressing charges. Daniel saves Jennifer's life after, admitting that he loves her, by removing her appendix before it bursts, with Nicole's help. Jennifer admits to Daniel, while the surgery goes on, that she loves him. She forgets afterwards, however, but is glad that Daniel's hand tremors are gone thanks to the treatment she found for him. Later, she remembers what she told him, and, with Abby, says goodbye to her old life with Jack. Daniel and Jennifer reunite with nearly everyone's blessing, but Jennifer's half brother, Lucas Horton, doesn't approve of the reunion due to his bitter past with Daniel. On New Year's Eve, Daniel and Jennifer share a kiss and spend the night together.\n\nChloe Lane returns to Salem. She had previously given birth to a son, whom she had named Parker Jonas. The supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip Kiriakis was Parker's father, leading to the end of the marriage between Chloe and Daniel. Having lost him, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping she could get Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe goes so far as to have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.\n\nAfter seeing a passport at Chloe's mother Nancy's place, Daniel figured out Chloe's scheme, with help from Rafe, and reconciles with Jennifer, who also got her job back at the hospital. Chloe said she repents and leaves town for treatment, leaving Parker with Daniel and Jennifer. Jennifer is delighted when JJ returns to Salem (now a teenager).\n\nJennifer is devastated by Daniel's death in 2016. In late 2017, Jennifer begins a relationship with [[Eric Brady]]. The two later get engaged but Eric breaks it off when he learns she's known where [[Nicole Walker]] was for a couple of months. Shortly after at a New Years party [[Jack Deveraux]] returns and has full blown amnesia. Months later, Jennifer suffered a fall that left her in a year-long coma.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jack and Jennifer]]\n*[[Supercouple]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/jennifer.php Jennifer at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\u00a8\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of our Lives characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horton, Jennifer}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters|Horton, Jennifer]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{overly detailed|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Jennifer Horton\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist |\n* Maren Stephenson (1976\u20131977)\n* Jennifer Peterson (1977\u20131979)\n* [[Melissa Reeves]] (1985\u20131995, 2000\u2013present)\n* Stephanie Cameron (1995\u20131998)\n}}\n| years          = {{Flatlist |\n* 1976\u20131979\n* 1985\u20131998\n* 2000\u20132006\n* 2010\u2013present\n}}\n| first          = {{start date|February 6, 1976}}\n| last           = \n| cause          = \n| creator        = [[Pat Falken Smith]]\n| introducer = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Betty Corday]] (1976)\n* Betty Corday and [[Al Rabin]] (1985)\n* [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] (2000)\n* Ken Corday and [[Gary Tomlin]] (2010)\n}}\n| classification = [[List of Days of Our Lives cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| books          = \n| spinoffs       = \n| image1         = Melissa Reeves as Jennifer Horton.png\n| caption1       = Melissa Reeves as Jennifer Horton\n| image2         = SC_Jennifer.png\n| caption2       = Stephanie Cameron as Jennifer Horton\n| alias          = Jennifer Alamain<br>Jennifer Deveraux<br>Jennifer Blake<br>Jennifer Rose Horton\n| occupation     = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Newspaper]] owner\n*[[Director of communications]]\n*[[Publicist]]\n*[[Chief communications officer|Public Relations Officer]]\n*[[Journalist]]\n*[[Talk show|Talk show host]]\n*[[Waitress]]\n*[[Prison officer|Jail guard]]\n*[[Knife throwing|Knife Thrower's Assistant]]\n*[[Columnist]]\n}} \n| residence      = [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem, Illinois]]\n| family         = Horton\n| parents        = {{unbulleted list|[[Bill Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Bill Horton]]|[[Laura Horton]]}}\n| brothers=[[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Mike Horton]]\n|halfbrothers=[[Lucas Horton]]\n| spouse         = {{unbulleted list|[[Lawrence Alamain]] (1990\u20131991)|[[Jack Deveraux]] (1991\u20131993, 2003\u20132011, 2019\u2013present<!-- Per MOS:DATERANGE, 2019 is the present and Template:Infobox soap character/Wikipedia:SOAP, only year should be displayed, as dates do not exist within fictional worlds. -->)|[[Peter Blake (Days of our Lives)|Peter Blake]] (1995\u20131996)}}\n| children       = {{unbulleted list|[[Abigail Deveraux]]|[[JJ Deveraux]]}}\n| grandsons  = [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Thomas DiMera|Thomas DiMera]]\n| granddaughters = [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Charlotte DiMera|Charlotte DiMera]]\n| grandfathers = [[Tom Horton]] <br> James Spencer\n| grandmothers = [[Alice Horton]] <br> Carrie Spencer\n| uncles [[Tom Horton, Jr.]] <br> [[Mickey Horton]] \n| aunts <br> [[Addie Horton]] <br> [[Marie Horton]]\n| nephews = [[Jeremy Horton]] <br> [[Will Horton]] \n| nieces = [[Allie Horton]]\n| cousins        = {{unbulleted list|[[Julie Olson Williams]]|Steven Olson|[[Sandy Horton]]|[[Hope Brady|Hope Williams Brady]]|[[Melissa Horton]] (adoptive)|[[Sarah Horton]] (legal)}} \n}}\n\n'''Jennifer Horton''' is a [[fictional character]] on the NBC daytime drama, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', a long running dramatic serial about life in the fictional town of [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]].

She is the daughter of original characters [[Bill Horton (Days of our Lives)|Bill Horton]] and [[Laura Horton]]. Jennifer is the mother of [[Abby Deveraux|Abigail Deveraux]] and [[JJ Deveraux|Jack Deveraux, Jr. (JJ)]]<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAs Jennifer is introduced on February 9, 1976, the role was originated by child actress [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Maren Stephenson]] until August 8, 1977. For storyline purposes, the role is briefly taken over by [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Jennifer Peterson]] from December 1, 1977 to July 4, 1979, until the character was written out of the show upon completion. A main reason is that her mother, [[Laura Horton]], had been shipped off to a psychiatric facility and would not be able to care for her. Laura's exit was prompted by the fact that her portrayer, [[Rosemary Forsyth]], wanted to leave the show to pursue other things.\n\nOn October 9, 1985, the character was re-introduced with ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' actress [[Melissa Reeves]] in the role. During her time in the role she proved to be a fan favorite, and younger leading heroine. Her relationship with [[Jack Deveraux]] prompted the couple to be pronounced a supercouple for the daytime drama.<ref name=\"SOApoperadigest.com\"/> Reeves stayed with the serial until she abruptly quit on December 15, 1995, at the insistence of her husband, [[Scott Reeves]]. To replace Reeves, the show brought on [[List of previous Days of our Lives cast members|Stephanie Cameron]] as Jennifer on December 18, 1995. Cameron portrayed the character until she was written off the show on June 5, 1998.<ref name=\"Stephanie Cameron Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/stephanie-cameron/person/22842/summary.html|title=Stephanie Cameron Bio|publisher=[[TV]].com |date= Jul 30, 2010<!-- 11:07 AM ET-->|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2000, rumors started swirling that Melissa Reeves would be returning to the show, due to the series crumbling to fill the void left by the departures of front-burner cast members [[Vivian Alamain]], played by [[Louise Sorel]] and [[Eric Brady]], played by [[Jensen Ackles]]. Her return was officially announced in April 2000. Reeves returned to work and began airing shortly after on October 6.<ref name=\"Melissa Reeves Bio\"/> After six years on the serial, Reeves departed again on September 21, 2006 to spend time with her family.

In 1985, Jennifer returns to Salem as a teenager in deep trouble who dressed in a style similar to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at the time. She has become a rebellious runaway, a compulsive liar, and is being stalked by a rapist. Her brother Dr. Mike Horton comes to her rescue. By the following year she gives up on her runaway lifestyle and moves back in with her grandparents, Tom and Alice Horton. During the summer of 1986, she begins a non-intimate romance with a high school classmate Glenn Gallagher. However, Jennifer inadvertently exposes Glenn's plan to uncover his coach's drug dealing. Jennifer trails Glenn to the park and finds the coach holding a gun to Glenn's head. Jennifer then enlists the help of classmate [[Frankie Brady]].<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> Later, when on a class trip, Jennifer and Frankie discover they have feelings for one another.  Jennifer rejects Glenn's pressure to have sex and turns to Frankie.  Together, Jennifer and Frankie foil a robbery attempt and help bust a prostitution ring.  In 1987, Jennifer's father Bill returns to Salem and tries running Jennifer's life.  Jennifer rebels by becoming engaged to Frankie; however, she breaks the engagement when she learns of her mother and grandmother's mental problems, thinking she'd develop the same problems and pass them  on to her own children. They reunite briefly, but Eve (who has a crush on Frankie) spills the beans about an affair Frankie had while separated from Jennifer.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===1989\u20132006===\nIn 1989, Jennifer becomes an intern reporter at the Salem Spectator, working under the tutelage of publisher [[Jack Deveraux]].<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> She befriends Sally, a pregnant homeless girl who gets herself arrested so she won't have her baby on the streets. But the officials won't let Sally keep her baby once it was born. Jack pretends to be Jennifer's husband, and they offer the child Hannah a foster home. Jack soon falls in love with Jennifer, but Emilio soon comes to town. Although Emilio pulls away from Jennifer when she is threatened by the gang Emilio once belonged to,<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> Jennifer soon finds herself torn between Emilio and Jack. When Jack hides his feelings for Jennifer, she then becomes engaged to Emilio. Desperate to keep Jennifer from marrying Emilio, Jack kidnaps her on her wedding day. When Jennifer escapes, she falls off a cliff and was knocked unconscious. Jack finally pours his heart out to her. Later, Jack becomes insecure about his feelings for Jennifer, so she returns to Emilio.

Jennifer believes that Lawrence thinks she is Katerina, the heiress to the Von Leuschner fortune, due to a confusion going back to when the real heiress (Carly Manning) and Jennifer were teenagers and they had switched dates.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> After a hurried wedding, Lawrence rapes Jennifer, admitting that he knew her real identity all along. Jack arrives to rescue Jennifer. Jack and Jennifer became engaged, but he calls off the wedding because he feels alienated from her. Jennifer is still unable to handle intimacy and is too ashamed to tell Jack that Lawrence raped her. Jack then marries Eve to help her get her hands on her $10 million inheritance. After Jennifer finally tells Jack the truth, she presses rape charges against Lawrence. Kimberly and Jack are able to record him confessing to the rape, and Lawrence is then sent to jail. Eve reluctantly grants Jack a divorce, and Jack and Jennifer are married. Soon after, a swindler named Hawk soon cheats them out of their money. He is caught, but the couple remains penniless. Jennifer then learns she is pregnant, but Jack's joy is not great. He thinks he is suffering a relapse of Hodgkin's disease. Though he is not ill, Jennifer goes to New York to do a TV show with Calliope. Jennifer gives birth later that year to a daughter, Abigail Johanna.<ref name=\"thequietcorner1\"/>\n\nThe following year, Abigail is diagnosed with [[Aplastic Anemia]]. Jennifer teams up with Austin Reed to find the environmental cause of Abigail's illness. It is soon revealed that Jack was the one who had allowed the toxic waste dumping and was responsible for Abigail's illness. Overwhelmed with guilt, Jack leaves Salem and Jennifer behind. Jennifer begins dating Peter Blake after Jack is gone. Peter is involved with drug trafficking at the time. Jennifer's mother Laura sees Peter with a lowlife by the name of Leo as the two of them scheme to make it appear as if Laura is having a mental relapse. Jack returns to Salem and spies on his ex-wife and her current love.<ref name=\"thequietcorner1\"/> Jennifer begins to try to find a man named Clark, who her mom had feelings for.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> It turns out that Clark is actually Jack. Jennifer is devastated and goes through with her marriage to Peter. Jack tries continuously to prove that Peter is devious but to no avail. A year later, Jennifer and Peter separate when she finds out he lied to her. Jack catches Peter with a syringe meant for Jennifer so that Peter can drug her and then take her and Abigail out of the country. Jack ends up shooting Peter, and it looks like Peter has died. (Stefano switches Peter's alive body with the dead body of an old associate wearing a Peter mask.)\n\nJack is sentenced to serving life in prison for the death of Peter, and Jennifer vows her eternal love for Jack every day. Jack breaks out of jail and takes Jen with him to evade police. They all are on the run for a while, until they join up with a circus. Jack becomes a laborer and Jen the assistant with Abby, their daughter. Abby strikes up a good friendship with the ringmaster's son. Eventually, Jack and Jennifer flee for Africa. While in Africa, Jennifer and Jack experience some problems with their relationship, especially when Jennifer falls for a young man named Colin Murphy...whom she does not realize is [[Shawn Brady]]'s nephew! She flees to Ireland with Abby, where she ends up getting herself in trouble, and then has to come back to Salem with Bo. Jack soon follows her, and the two move in together so they can look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushes Jack away and concentrates on relationships, first with Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack can't resist that certain something that has always been between them. They are remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.\n\nJack and Jennifer are just beginning to enjoy their married life together again and hosting \"In the House,\" a show that was a wedding gifts from Jennifer's father Bill to her and Jack. Jennifer is then dealt the harshest blow of her life when Jack is struck down in an alley behind Salem Place by the Salem Stalker, and Jennifer is forced to make the choice of taking him off life support and donating his organs. Abby is unable to forgive her mother until Jennifer realizes she is pregnant, but tragedy strikes again when Jennifer learns that her baby will have serious mental and physical deformities, and Lexie advises her to terminate.\n\n[[File:Missy&ty.PNG|thumb|right|[[Ty Treadway]] has played a part in Jennifer's return storyline in 2010.]]Desperate to hold on to the last part of Jack she would ever have, Jennifer refuses to terminate her pregnancy.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/> With the help of her new tenant and friend, [[Patrick Lockhart]], Jennifer begins looking forward to a new life with Abby and the baby. When she is nearly full term, Jennifer gets a message on her computer, supposedly from Jack, and takes off to find him. She is picked up by a pilot who was to take her to the island of Melaswen. Unfortunately, the plane crashes, and Jennifer ends up in the jungle. She is thrilled when she reunited with Jack, and together the two begin planning a future for Jack Patrick Jr. (who is delivered by Patrick), but when they try to return to Salem, Jack is presumed dead on the return voyage. Jennifer tries to move on with her life, but finds it difficult because Abby can't forgive Jennifer for Jack's death. Jennifer is almost preparing to move on when a miracle occurs and Jack is back home for real. Together, Jack and Jennifer work on rebuilding their family, which is complete now that Abby are getting along much better with her mother. The two get a job offer for London, and Jack and Jennifer leave for London with baby Jack.<ref name=\"Jennifer Horton Bio\"/>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn June 2010, Jennifer returns to Salem after receiving the news that her grandmother, [[Alice Horton]], is very ill and does not have much time left. Jennifer gets to say goodbye to her \"Gram\", but is distraught as one of the closest people to her and the woman that raised her died. While in Salem, Jennifer tries to provide guidance to [[Bo and Hope]], inferring that she thinks it is best if they reconcile. She also gets to reunite with her old friend, [[Carly Manning]], who she had not seen in years. Jennifer leaves Salem after Alice's funeral and after an altercation with [[Vivian Alamain]], and returns to London to be with her family. She, however, returns to Salem in November of that same year to help Hope, who was in prison after confessing to the Salem Muggings.\n\nHope refuses to let Jennifer help her as she is determined to pay for her crimes. The women's prison that Hope is staying at, however, is trafficking human organs that came from dead inmates, and the doctor that Jennifer had been seeing at the time is helping Warden Jane and the DiMera family. After Bo helps Hope escape for the jail after being nearly beaten to death, Jennifer uses her journalism background to get a job at the prison to try and save Hope and expose the illegal scam at the prison. Warden Jane and Lee, however, discover Jennifer's true motives, and removes Jennifer's heart from her body with the intention of giving it to Dr. Walters to save a patient at the hospital. Melanie Layton and Dr. Daniel Jonas are informed of Jennifer's condition and rush to save her. Daniel ends up putting Jennifer's heart back into her chest and saves her life. This begins a flirtatious relationship between the two. Meanwhile, Jennifer's daughter Abigial, returns home to Salem to be with her mother.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Soap Opera Digest Article, Late Breaking News:Melissa Reeves Returns to Days, May 4, 2010</ref> Without hearing a word from her husband Jack, Jennifer decides it is best if she divorces Jack and moves on with her life. After the divorce is finalized and after flirting for months, Jennifer and Daniel began to date, much to the dismay of Jennifer and Daniel's good friend, Dr. Carly Manning. In July 2011, Jennifer discovered that Carly had been using drugs and had become addicted due to her life falling apart and Jennifer being with Daniel, the man she feels she wants to love. Jennifer and Daniel end up getting Carly medical help. Carly, along with her son, Nicholas, leave Salem to go to Europe.\n\nAs Jennifer and Daniel fall deeper in love, Jack unexpectedly returns to Salem. Although Jennifer and Abby are upset at his absence, he reveals that he was held prisoner in Afghanistan while covering the opium trade there, and that a British friend he had there was killed, giving him PTSD. Wanting to support him, Jennifer gets closer to Jack, and the two realize that they still love each other. Unable to make a choice between Daniel and Jack, Daniel breaks up with Jennifer and leaves Salem. Jennifer helps Abe with his campaign for mayor, though they lose to EJ DiMera. Jennifer eventually wins Jack's heart, and the two get engaged. When Daniel returns, Jennifer asks him if they can be friends, and he tells her they can, while he begins a secret romance with Nicole Walker. When the tunnels explode underneath Salem, Jack saves Abby from being trapped in a broken elevator. The elevator, with Jack inside, plunges several stories, causing Jack to die. Distraught, Abby and Jennifer scatter his ashes off the shores of northern California. Broken, Jennifer allows a pregnant Nicole to live with her, in order to keep Daniel happy and so that Victor Kiriakis doesn't have to let her live with him. Nicole reveals her relationship with Daniel, which makes Jennifer uneasy and argumentative with Nicole. Jennifer tells Nicole that she must leave after she gives birth. After Nicole sees a close moment between Daniel and Jennifer and later loses her baby, she gets in a fight with Jennifer, ending with Nicole falling down some stairs and \"miscarrying.\" Nicole blames Jennifer for the fall, but the truth is revealed that Nicole knew her baby died but was keeping it a secret so that Daniel would take her to Hawaii. Knowing that Daniel will love Jennifer and will never love Nicole, Nicole apologizes for her wrongdoings and leaves the duo alone. Daniel agrees to still be her friend, and he and Jennifer forgive her, not pressing charges. Daniel saves Jennifer's life after, admitting that he loves her, by removing her appendix before it bursts, with Nicole's help. Jennifer admits to Daniel, while the surgery goes on, that she loves him. She forgets afterwards, however, but is glad that Daniel's hand tremors are gone thanks to the treatment she found for him. Later, she remembers what she told him, and, with Abby, says goodbye to her old life with Jack. Daniel and Jennifer reunite with nearly everyone's blessing, but Jennifer's half brother, Lucas Horton, doesn't approve of the reunion due to his bitter past with Daniel. On New Year's Eve, Daniel and Jennifer share a kiss and spend the night together.\n\nChloe Lane returns to Salem. She had previously given birth to a son, whom she had named Parker Jonas. The supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip Kiriakis was Parker's father, leading to the end of the marriage between Chloe and Daniel. Having lost him, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping she could get Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe goes so far as to have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.\n\nAfter seeing a passport at Chloe's mother Nancy's place, Daniel figured out Chloe's scheme, with help from Rafe, and reconciles with Jennifer, who also got her job back at the hospital. Chloe said she repents and leaves town for treatment, leaving Parker with Daniel and Jennifer. Jennifer is delighted when JJ returns to Salem (now a teenager).\n\nJennifer is devastated by Daniel's death in 2016. In late 2017, Jennifer begins a relationship with [[Eric Brady]]. The two later get engaged but Eric breaks it off when he learns she\u2019s known where [[Nicole Walker]] was for a couple of months. Shortly after at a New Years party [[Jack Deveraux]] returns and has full blown amnesia. Months later, Jennifer suffered a fall that left her in a year-long coma.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jack and Jennifer]]\n*[[Supercouple]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/jennifer.php Jennifer at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\u00a8\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of our Lives characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horton, Jennifer}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters|Horton, Jennifer]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2010\u2013present:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: she\u2019s \u2192 she's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Horton"}
