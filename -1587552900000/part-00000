In the 15th century a salt source is mentioned in the area, but it was not until 1554 that a large deposit was discovered in Panex.  Production of the salt began shortly thereafter.  In 1582 a salt works was built in [[Roche, Vaud|Roche]].  Initially the salt works were run by [[Bern]]ese [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s and then foreign nobles.  In 1685 the salt mines came under the direct control of the Bernese state.  At the beginning of the 18th century it was entrusted to a general director, the most famous of which was [[Albrecht von Haller]].<ref name=HDS_Salt>{{HDS|40073<!--Section 1-1-->|Salt mine of Bex}}</ref>\n\nTo provide wood for the salt works in Roche, in 1695 a forest was planted in the Joux Verte gorge.  Starting in the 16th Century, they began to replace natural evaporation with boiling to speed up salt production.  The first tunnels were dug in 1684 to find new salt sources.  Salt deposits were discovered in Le B\u00e9vieux and Les Devens (both part of the municipality of Bex) and Aigle.  The mine at Le B\u00e9vieux was still in operation at the beginning of the 21st century.<ref name=HDS_Salt/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bex - Dents du Midi.jpg|thumb|left|Bex with the [[Dents du Midi]] in background]]\nBex has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|96.56|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

Bex is also the terminus of the [[Bex\u2013Villars\u2013Bretaye railway]] (BVB), which is one of four railways of the local TPC company, the [[Transports Publics du Chablais]]. The BVB runs east from Bex to Villars and Bretaye. At nearby [[Aigle]], connections are available at the Aigle SBB/CFF station to the other three very scenic narrow gauge railways of TPC.\n\nTransports Publics du Chablais uses the motto \"Depuis plus de cent ans et contre toute attente, des lignes des TPC r\u00e9unissent plaine et montagne, Vaud et Valais, ville et campagne, terres catholiques et protestantes.\" Translated roughly: \"For over 100 years and contrary to all expectations, the railways of TPC have joined plain and mountain, town and country, of the Vaud and Valais districts of Switzerland, land of both Catholics and Protestants.\" The ASD, the AL, and the BVB railways operate within the Canton of Vaud. The AOMC also operates into the Canton of Valais when it leaves Aigle and crosses the Rhone river to reach Monthey and [[Champ\u00e9ry]].  The TPC \"motto\" refers to the religious composition and history of the region historically known as the Chablais. In 1846-7 the Valais canton attempted to secede from Switzerland with the intention of joining a Catholic confederation of cantons called the Sonderbund, but this was put down by Swiss Federal troops in the brief and relatively bloodless Sonderbund civil war.\n\n==Notable people of Bex==\n*[[Marie-Louise Dreier]], the poet, lives near here\n*[[Catherine Mabillard]], ski mountaineer\n*[[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier]], Botanist\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nBex is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Tuttlingen]], Germany<ref>[http://www.asccre.ch/N208/vaud-waadt-vaud/?M=229 Conseil des Communes et Regions d'Europe]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{in lang|fr}} accessed 27 April 2011</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Commons category|Bex}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{HDS|8481|Diablerets, Les}}\n{{Municipalities of the district of Aigle}}\n\n[[Category:Bex| ]]\n[[Category:Cultural property of national significance in Vaud]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox Swiss town\n | subject_name\t\t= Bex\n | municipality_name\t= Bex\n | municipality_type\t= municipality\n | image_photo          = 20020807 bex rue du cropt.jpg\n | image_caption        = Rue du Cropt in Bex  \n | imagepath_coa\t= Blason_ville_CH_Bex_(Vaud).svg|pixel_coa=\n | map\t\t\t=\n | languages\t\t= French\n | canton\t\t= Vaud\n | iso-code-region \t= CH-VD\n | district\t\t= [[Aigle (district)|Aigle]]\n |coordinates = {{coord|46|15|N|7|1|E|display=inline,title}}\n |lat_NS=N|long_EW=E\n | postal_code\t\t= 1880\n | municipality_code\t= 5402\n | area\t\t\t= 96.56\n | elevation\t\t= 424|elevation_description=\n | population\t\t= 5751|populationof=2003\n | website\t\t= www.bex.ch\n | mayor\t\t= Pierre Rochat|mayor_asof=|mayor_party=\n | mayor_title\t= Syndic |list_of_mayors\t=\n | places\t\t=\n | demonym\t\t=\n | neighboring_municipalities= [[Chamoson]] (VS), [[Collonges (Valais)|Collonges]] (VS), [[Conthey]] (VS), [[Fully]] (VS), [[Gryon]], [[Lavey-Morcles]], [[Leytron]] (VS), [[Massongex]] (VS), [[Monthey]] (VS), [[Ollon]], [[Ormont-Dessus]], [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice]] (VS)\n | twintowns\t\t= [[Tuttlingen]] (Germany)\n|}}\n\n'''Bex''' (German:Beis) is a [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] in the canton of [[Vaud]], [[Switzerland]], located in the [[Aigle (district)|district of Aigle]].

In the 15th century a salt source is mentioned in the area, but it was not until 1554 that a large deposit was discovered in Panex.  Production of the salt began shortly thereafter.  In 1582 a salt works was built in [[Roche, Vaud|Roche]].  Initially the salt works were run by [[Bern]]ese [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s and then foreign nobles.  In 1685 the salt mines came under the direct control of the Bernese state.  At the beginning of the 18th century it was entrusted to a general director, the most famous of which was [[Albrecht von Haller]].<ref name=HDS_Salt>{{HDS|40073<!--Section 1-1-->|Salt mine of Bex}}</ref>\n\nTo provide wood for the salt works in Roche, in 1695 a forest was planted in the Joux Verte gorge.  Starting in the 16th Century, they began to replace natural evaporation with boiling to speed up salt production.  The first tunnels were dug in 1684 to find new salt sources.  Salt deposits were discovered in Le B\u00e9vieux and Les Devens (both part of the municipality of Bex) and Aigle.

Bex is also the terminus of the [[Bex\u2013Villars\u2013Bretaye railway]] (BVB), which is one of four railways of the local TPC company, the [[Transports Publics du Chablais]]. The BVB runs east from Bex to Villars and Bretaye. At nearby [[Aigle]], connections are available at the Aigle SBB/CFF station to the other three very scenic narrow gauge railways of TPC.\n\nTransports Publics du Chablais uses the motto \"Depuis plus de cent ans et contre toute attente, des lignes des TPC r\u00e9unissent plaine et montagne, Vaud et Valais, ville et campagne, terres catholiques et protestantes.\" Translated roughly: \"For over 100 years and contrary to all expectations, the railways of TPC have joined plain and mountain, town and country, of the Vaud and Valais districts of Switzerland, land of both Catholics and Protestants.\" The ASD, the AL, and the BVB railways operate within the Canton of Vaud. The AOMC also operates into the Canton of Valais when it leaves Aigle and crosses the Rhone river to reach Monthey and [[Champ\u00e9ry]].  The TPC \"motto\" refers to the religious composition and history of the region historically known as the Chablais.

This [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] gel swells and increases in volume when absorbing water: it exerts an expansive pressure inside the [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] aggregate, causing [[spalling]] and loss of strength of the concrete, finally leading to its failure.\n\nASR can lead to serious cracking in concrete, resulting in critical structural problems that can even force the [[demolition]] of a particular structure.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Understanding Cement | url = http://www.understanding-cement.com/alkali-silica.html | title = Alkali\u2013silica reaction in concrete |accessdate=2007-08-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810144427/http://www.understanding-cement.com/alkali-silica.html| archivedate= 10 August 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-36297780 |title=Merafield Bridge in Plympton demolished |accessdate=2016-05-16}}</ref> The expansion of concrete through reaction between cement and aggregates was first studied by Thomas E.

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nIndeed, the term ''silicic acid'' has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silica]], SiO<sub>2</sub>. Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. \n:SiO<sub>2</sub>\u2193 + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> \n\nAn ancient industrial notation referring to {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, [[metasilicic acid]], is also often used to depict the alkali-silica reaction. However, the metasilicic acid, {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, or {{Chem|SiO|(OH)|2}}, is a hypothetic molecule which has never been observed, even in extreme diluted solutions because {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}} is unstable and continue to hydrate. \n\nIndeed, contrary to the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> which consumes only one water molecule and stops at H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, the hydration of SiO<sub>2</sub> consumes two water molecules and continues one step further to form H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The difference in [[hydration energy|hydration]] behaviour between SiO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is explained by [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons ([[Gibbs free energy]]) and by [[bond energy]] or [[steric hindrance]] around the central atom of the molecule. \n\nThat is why the more correct geochemical notation referring to the [[orthosilicic acid]] {{Chem|Si|(OH)|4}} really existing in dilute solution is preferred here. However, the main advantage of the now deprecated, but still often used, industrial notation referring to the metasilicate anion ({{Chem|Si|O|3|2\u2013}}), which also does not exist in aqueous solution, is its greater simplicity and its direct similitude in notation with the carbonate ({{Chem|C|O|3|2\u2013}}) system. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species ([[alkali hydroxide]]s, also often simply called [[alkali]]) responsible for the silica dissolution in the alkali-silica reaction do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation of the ultimate reaction with portlandite, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Anhydrous and hydrated silica surface with [[siloxane]] and [[silanol]] groups along with surface bound water molecules.]]\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. \n\nThe presence of these oxygen-bearing groups very prone to form [[hydrogen bond]]s with water molecules explains the affinity of silica for water and makes colloidal silica very [[hydrophile]]. \n\nSiloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with lime)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\nThe soda lime carbonation reaction can be directly translated into the ancient industrial notation of silicate (referring to the never observed [[metasilicic acid]]) simply by substituting a C atom by a Si atom in the mass balance equations (''i.e.'', by replacing a carbonate by a metasilicate anion). This gives the following set of reactions also commonly encountered in the literature to schematically depict the continuous regeneration of NaOH in ASR: \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(SiO<sub>2</sub> quickly dissolved by hygroscopic NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with portlandite)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction ressembling the [[Pozzolanic reaction]])\n|}\n\nIf NaOH is clearly deficient in the system under consideration (soda lime or alkali-silica reaction), it is formally possible to write the same reactions sets by simply replacing the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HSiO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the principle of catalysis remaining the same, even if the number of intermediate species differs.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste), calcium sulfo-aluminate phases ([[AFm phase|AFm]] and AFt, [[ettringite]]) and [[hydrogarnet]]. C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) (~&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;M at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C) and therefore are expected to play a negligible role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (here, explicitly written in the ancient industrial metasilicate notation (based on the non-existing [[metasilicic acid]], {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}) to also illustrate the frequent use of this later in the literature): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected aggregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous non-stoechiometric calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H, the non-stoechiometry being denoted here by the use of dashes) can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1\">EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\"EN_206\">NBN EN 206:2013+A1:2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.'' (2003) as a universal accelerated test for alkali-aggregate reaction.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Grattan-Bellew\n| first = P.E.\n|author2=G. Cybanski |author3=B. Fournier |author4=L.

For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nIndeed, the term ''silicic acid'' has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silica]], SiO<sub>2</sub>. Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. \n:SiO<sub>2</sub>\u2193 + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> \n\nAn ancient industrial notation referring to {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, [[metasilicic acid]], is also often used to depict the alkali-silica reaction. However, the metasilicic acid, {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, or {{Chem|SiO|(OH)|2}}, is a hypothetic molecule which has never been observed, even in extreme diluted solutions because {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}} is unstable and continue to hydrate. \n\nIndeed, contrary to the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> which consumes only one water molecule and stops at H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, the hydration of SiO<sub>2</sub> consumes two water molecules and continues one step further to form H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The difference in [[hydration energy|hydration]] behaviour between SiO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is explained by [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons ([[Gibbs free energy]]) and by [[bond energy]] or [[steric hindrance]] around the central atom of the molecule. \n\nThat is why the more correct geochemical notation referring to the [[orthosilicic acid]] {{Chem|Si|(OH)|4}} really existing in dilute solution is preferred here. However, the main advantage of the now deprecated, but still often used, industrial notation referring to the metasilicate anion ({{Chem|Si|O|3|2\u2013}}), which also does not exist in aqueous solution, is its greater simplicity and its direct similitude in notation with the carbonate ({{Chem|C|O|3|2\u2013}}) system. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species ([[alkali hydroxide]]s, also often simply called [[alkali]]) responsible for the silica dissolution in the alkali-silica reaction do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation of the ultimate reaction with portlandite, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Anhydrous and hydrated silica surface with [[siloxane]] and [[silanol]] groups along with surface bound water molecules.]]\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. \n\nThe presence of these oxygen-bearing groups very prone to form [[hydrogen bond]]s with water molecules explains the affinity of silica for water and makes colloidal silica very [[hydrophile]]. \n\nSiloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with lime)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\nThe soda lime carbonation reaction can be directly translated into the ancient industrial notation of silicate (referring to the never observed [[metasilicic acid]]) simply by substituting a C atom by a Si atom in the mass balance equations (''i.e.'', by replacing a carbonate by a metasilicate anion). This gives the following set of reactions also commonly encountered in the literature to schematically depict the continuous regeneration of NaOH in ASR: \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(SiO<sub>2</sub> quickly dissolved by hygroscopic NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with portlandite)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction ressembling the [[Pozzolanic reaction]])\n|}\n\n\nIf NaOH is clearly deficient in the system under consideration (soda lime or alkali-silica reaction), it is formally possible to write the same reactions sets by simply replacing the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HSiO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the principle of catalysis remaining the same, even if the number of intermediate species differs.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste), calcium sulfo-aluminate phases ([[AFm phase|AFm]] and AFt, [[ettringite]]) and [[hydrogarnet]]. C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) (~&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;M at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C) and therefore are expected to play a negligible role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (here, explicitly written in the ancient industrial metasilicate notation (based on the non-existing [[metasilicic acid]], {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}) to also illustrate the frequent use of this later in the literature): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected aggregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous non-stoechiometric calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H, the non-stoechiometry being denoted here by the use of dashes) can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1\">EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\"EN_206\">NBN EN 206:2013+A1:2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.'' (2003) as a universal accelerated test for alkali-aggregate reaction.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Grattan-Bellew\n| first = P.E.\n|author2=G. Cybanski |author3=B. Fournier |author4=L.

For example, in [[Inner Mongolia]] in modern-day [[China]], the [[Daur people|Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Polo]], with origins in the central Asian steppes and directly attested since at least the [[Parthian Empire]] (247&nbsp;BCE \u2013 224&nbsp;CE) is essentially same sort of game but adapted to horseback.\n\nStein and Rubino also devote considerable analysis to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian lawn/court and board games with equipment similar to medieval European lawn billiards and to bat-and-ball games. Much more speculatively, they suggest that for the Egyptians there may have been rich religious symbology involved. They note the resemblance of the game's ball, shooting stick, and king ping to the [[orb]], [[sceptre]] or [[ceremonial mace]] (which originally had a [[Crook and flail|crook]] at the top like a gaming mace), and [[crown]] of imperial [[regalia]], which later were adopted by the [[Roman Empire|pagan Romans]] and ([[Globus cruciger|in modified form]]) in turn by rulers of [[Christendom]]. It is suggestive that games like ground billiards in the medieval Christian world were for centuries primarily the purview of and preserved by the clergy and the nobility, with peasant game-playing suppressed to the extent possible by many rulers, as unproductive.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\n==Game play and equipment==\nThe exact rules of game play, and whether these rules were consistent from region to region, are unknown.  [[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiards table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\" />  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\" />\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" /> Most woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\" /> The term \"king pin\" or \"kingpin\", which today may refer to essential components of any system, from bosses of [[organized crime]] syndicates, to the main support bolt in the axle assemblies (trucks) of [[skateboard]]s, appears to derive from its usage as a key component of ground billiards, early skittle bowling, and related games.<ref name=\"etym_king\" /> There are some records that some of the early king pins in ground billiards games were made of bone.<ref name=\"book_TheS\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book |title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |date=1996 |orig-year=1985 |edition=amended |isbn=978-0-85263-730-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\">{{Cite book |first1=Leila C. |last1=Dorion |first2=Julia A. |last2=Shepherd |title=History of Bowling and Billiards |location=Kansas City, Missouri |publisher=Constable-Hurd Printing Co. |date=1928 |pages=28, 65, 68 |url= http://www.archive.org/details/historyofbowling008027mbp}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Twardy 1937\">{{Cite news |first=E.

For example, in [[Inner Mongolia]] in modern-day [[China]], the [[Daur people|Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Polo]], with origins in the central Asian steppes and directly attested since at least the [[Parthian Empire]] (247&nbsp;BCE \u2013 224&nbsp;CE) is essentially same sort of game but adapted to horseback.\n\nStein and Rubino also devote considerable analysis to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian lawn/court and board games with equipment similar to medieval European lawn billiards and to bat-and-ball games. Much more speculatively, they suggest that for the Egyptians there may have been rich religious symbology involved. They note the resemblance of the game's ball, shooting stick, and king ping to the [[orb]], [[sceptre]] or [[ceremonial mace]] (which originally had a [[Crook and flail|crook]] at the top like a gaming mace), and [[crown]] of imperial [[regalia]], which later were adopted by the [[Roman Empire|pagan Romans]] and ([[Globus cruciger|in modified form]]) in turn by rulers of [[Christendom]]. It is suggestive that games like ground billiards in the medieval Christian world were for centuries primarily the purview of and preserved by the clergy and the nobility, with peasant game-playing suppressed to the extent possible by many rulers, as unproductive.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\n==Game play and equipment==\nThe exact rules of game play, and whether these rules were consistent from region to region, are unknown.  [[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiards table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\" />  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\" />\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" /> Most woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\" /> The term \"king pin\" or \"kingpin\", which today may refer to essential components of any system, from bosses of [[organized crime]] syndicates, to the main support bolt in the axle assemblies (trucks) of [[skateboard]]s, appears to derive from its usage as a key component of ground billiards, early skittle bowling, and related games.<ref name=\"etym_king\" /> There are some records that some of the early king pins in ground billiards games were made of bone.<ref name=\"book_TheS\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book |title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |date=1996 |orig-year=1985 |edition=amended |isbn=978-0-85263-730-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\">{{Cite book |first1=Leila C. |last1=Dorion |first2=Julia A. |last2=Shepherd |title=History of Bowling and Billiards |location=Kansas City, Missouri |publisher=Constable-Hurd Printing Co. |date=1928 |pages=28, 65, 68 |url= http://www.archive.org/details/historyofbowling008027mbp}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Twardy 1937\">{{Cite news |first=E.

The upper caste considered themselves as landlords and working in their vast fields was a sort of loss of dignity for them.

Although profitable to the Company, it was often not so for the peasant producer, and {{quote|Only one particular caste, the Koeris, managed to carry on the cultivation with some degree of efficiency.

She scares George by saying that she likes to eat [[insects]] and he wonders briefly if she's a [[witch]]. To punish her for her regular abuse, George decides to make a magic medicine to replace her old one. He collects a variety of ingredients from around the family farm including [[deodorant]] and [[shampoo]] from the bathroom, floor [[:wikt:polish|polish]] from the laundry room, [[horseradish]] sauce and [[gin]] from the kitchen, animal medicines, [[engine oil]] and [[anti-freeze]] from the garage, and brown [[paint]] to mimic the colour of the original medicine.\n\nAfter cooking the ingredients in the kitchen, George gives it as medicine to his grandmother, who grows as tall as the house, bursting through the roof. When his grandmother doesn't believe it was George who made her grow so tall, he proves it by feeding the medicine to one of his father's chickens, which grows ten times its original size.  Mr. and Mrs. Kranky return home and can't believe their eyes when they see the fattest chicken ever and the grandmother. George's father grows very excited at the thought of rearing giant animals so that they can end world hunger, and his family will be rich and famous.  He has George feed the medicine on the rest of the farm's animals, causing them to become giants as well.  However, his grandmother begins complaining about being ignored and stuck in the roof, so Mr. Kranky hires a crane to remove her from the house.

George attempts to recreate it, but is unable to remember all the ingredients. The second medicine makes a chicken's legs grow extremely long, and the third elongates a chicken's neck to bizarre proportions. The fourth has the opposite effect of the first and makes animals shrink. George's grandmother, now even more angry she's sleeping in the barn, storms over and starts complaining loudly that she's once again sick of being ignored. She sees the cup of medicine in George's hand and mistakes it for tea. Much to his and Mrs. Kranky's horror, and Mr. Kranky's delight, she drinks the entire cup and shrinks so much that she vanishes completely.  At first, Mrs. Kranky is shocked, confused and distraught about the sudden, and very strange disappearance of her mother, but soon accepts that she was becoming a nuisance anyway.
