Certain combinations of width and height are standardized and typically given a name and an [[Acronym|initialism]] that is descriptive of its dimensions. A higher display resolution in a display of the same size means that displayed photo or video content appears [[Sharpness (visual)|sharper]], and [[pixel art]] appears smaller.\n\n== Overview by vertical resolution and aspect ratio ==\n<!--\n\nDO NOT ADD THEORETICAL RESOLUTIONS TO THIS TABLE THAT YOU GOT FROM TYPING THINGS INTO A CALCULATOR\nDO NOT ADD MADE-UP NAMES TO THIS TABLE\n\nThis is a table of standard resolutions that readers may currently encounter or have encountered in the past. It is not for predicting what resolutions they may encounter in the future by trying to extrapolate new resolutions from past patterns to \"predict\" or list your expectation of what the next standard resolution will be.\n\nIn regards to names; there does not have to be a name for every resolution. Some resolutions simply don't have common names. If that is the case, then simply don't list a name for that resolution. When a resolution does have an industry-standard name, either by the authority of a standards document (which you should add as a reference in the dedicated article section below), or by industry-wide consensus on the usage of the term, the name may be listed. If there is no official or widely recognized name, then there should simply be no name listed. When a resolution does not have any standardized name, that does NOT mean it is an opportunity for you to make up your own name. This article is not here for internet people to propose a new standard or to create their own naming convention, it is here to document what actually exists in reality. Just because you have come up with a naming convention that you think is logical and perhaps SHOULD be used, Wikipedia is not the place for you to try to push your proposal forward by trying to pass it off as an industry-wide consensus or official standard.\n\nPlease do not add made-up calculator resolutions or made-up names to this table.\n\n-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" | Leftmost column is height in pixels, other columns show width in pixels for each aspect ratio.\n!title=\"vertical, lower number of pixels\" rowspan=2 scope=col| Lines\n!colspan=8 scope=colgroup| Display aspect ratio<ref name=\"VESA-CVT\">VESA CVT 1.2 from 2003 recommends only 4:3, 16:9 and 16:10 (8:5) aspect ratios for newly introduced display resolutions.

It is not for predicting what resolutions they may encounter in the future by trying to extrapolate new resolutions from past patterns to \"predict\" or list your expectation of what the next standard resolution will be.\n\nIn regards to names; there does not have to be a name for every resolution. Some resolutions simply don't have common names. If that is the case, then simply don't list a name for that resolution. When a resolution does have an industry-standard name, either by the authority of a standards document (which you should add as a reference in the dedicated article section below), or by industry-wide consensus on the usage of the term, the name may be listed. If there is no official or widely recognized name, then there should simply be no name listed. When a resolution does not have any standardized name, that does NOT mean it is an opportunity for you to make up your own name. This article is not here for internet people to propose a new standard or to create their own naming convention, it is here to document what actually exists in reality. Just because you have come up with a naming convention that you think is logical and perhaps SHOULD be used, Wikipedia is not the place for you to try to push your proposal forward by trying to pass it off as an industry-wide consensus or official standard.\n\nPlease do not add made-up calculator resolutions or made-up names to this table.\n\n-->\n\n== Aspect ratio ==\n[[File:Vector Video Standards2.svg|350px|right|thumb|Multiple display standards compared.]]\n{{main|Display aspect ratio}}\nThe favored aspect ratio of mass market display industry products has changed gradually from 4:3, then to 16:10, then to 16:9, and now changing to 18:9 for phones,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techtippr.com/18-by-9-aspect-ratio-in-smartphones-is-the-new-trend |title=18:9 Aspect Ratio in Smartphones will be the new Standard in 2018, Here\u2019s why |last=Ahmed |first=Asif |date=13 November 2017 |publisher=Techtippr |accessdate=2018-10-01}}</ref> and 21:9 for monitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/samsung-chg90-monitor-advantages-2017-6 |title=Playing games on Samsung\u2019s massive new computer monitor and other ultra-wide monitors gives you an advantage |last=Villas-Boas |first=Antonio |date=12 June 2017 |publisher=Business Insider Singapore |accessdate=2018-10-01}}</ref> The 4:3 [[aspect ratio]] generally reflects older products, especially the era of the [[Cathode-ray tube|cathode ray tube]] ('''CRT'''). The 16:10 aspect ratio had its largest use in the '''1995\u20132010''' period, and the 16:9 aspect ratio tends to reflect post-2010 mass market computer monitor, laptop, and entertainment products displays.\n\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio was common in older television cathode ray tube ('''CRT''') displays, which were not easily adaptable to a wider aspect ratio. When good quality alternate technologies (i.e., [[Liquid-crystal display|liquid crystal displays]] (LCDs) and plasma displays) became more available and less costly, around the year '''2000''', the common computer displays and entertainment products moved to a wider aspect ratio, first to the 16:10 ratio. The 16:10 ratio allowed some compromise between showing older 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows, but also allowing better viewing of widescreen movies. However, around the year 2005, home entertainment displays (i.e., TV sets) gradually moved from 16:10 to the 16:9 aspect ratio, for further improvement of viewing widescreen movies. By about 2007, virtually all mass market entertainment displays were 16:9. In 2011, {{resx|1920|1080}} (Full HD, the native resolution of [[Blu-ray]]) was the favored resolution in the most heavily marketed entertainment market displays. The next standard, '''{{resx|3840|2160}}''' ([[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]]), was first sold in 2013.\n\nAlso in 2013, displays with '''{{resx|2560|1080}}''' (aspect ratio 64:27 or 2.{{overline|370}}, however commonly referred to as \"21:9\" for easy comparison with 16:9) appeared, which closely approximate the common [[CinemaScope]] movie standard aspect ratio of 2.35\u20132.40. In 2014, \"21:9\" screens with pixel dimensions of {{resx|3440|1440}} (actual aspect ratio 43:18 or 2.3{{overline|8}}) became available as well.\n\nThe computer display industry maintained the 16:10 aspect ratio longer than the entertainment industry, but in the 2005\u20132010 period, computers were increasingly marketed as dual use products, with uses in the traditional computer applications, but also as means of viewing entertainment content. In this time frame, with the notable exception of Apple, almost all desktop, laptop, and display manufacturers gradually moved to promoting only 16:9 aspect ratio displays. By 2011, the 16:10 aspect ratio had virtually disappeared from the Windows laptop display market (although Mac laptops are still mostly 16:10, including the {{resx|2880|1800}} 15\" Retina MacBook Pro and the {{resx|2560|1600}} 13\" Retina MacBook Pro). One consequence of this transition was that the highest available resolutions moved generally downward (i.e., the move from {{resx|1920|1200}} laptop displays to {{resx|1920|1080}} displays).\n\n==High-definition==\n{{main|High-definition television}}\n{{see also|Standard-definition television}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" {{ts|ar|sm}}\n|+ High-definition\n!

Pixel doubling (vertically and horizontally) nHD frames will form one 720p frame and pixel tripling nHD frames will form one 1080p frame.\n\nOne drawback of this resolution is that the vertical resolution is not an even multiple of 16, which is a common [[macroblock]] size for [[video codec]]s. Video frames encoded with 16\u00d716 pixel macroblocks would be padded to {{resx|640|368}} and the added pixels would be cropped away at playback. H.264 codecs have this padding and cropping ability built-in as standard. The same is true for qHD and 1080p but the relative amount of padding is more for lower resolutions such as nHD.\n\nTo avoid storing the eight lines of padded pixels, some people prefer to encode video at {{resx|624|352}}, which only has one stored padded line. When such video streams are either encoded from HD frames or played back on HD displays in full screen mode (either 720p or 1080p) they are scaled by non-integer scale factors. True nHD frames on the other hand has integer scale factors, for example Nokia 808 PureView with nHD display.\n\n{{anchor|960x540|qHD|qHD (960x540)|qHD (960\u00d7540)}}\n=== {{resx|960|540}} (qHD) ===\n'''qHD''' is a display resolution of {{resx|960|540}} pixels, which is exactly one quarter of a [[#FHD (1920\u00d71080)|Full HD]] (1080p) frame, in a 16:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]].\n\n<!-- The following sentence is meant to give a few examples, it is not supposed to be a comprehensive list, so please don't keep adding to it indiscriminately. -->\nSimilar to DVGA, this resolution became popular for high-end smartphone displays in early 2011.

With its 16:9 aspect ratio it is exactly 2 times the width and 1{{sfrac|1|2}} times the height of 4:3 [[#VGA (640\u00d7480)|VGA]], which shares its aspect ratio and 480 line count with [[NTSC]]. HD therefore has exactly 3 times as many pixels as VGA.\n\nThis resolution is often referred to as '''[[720p]]''', although the ''p'' (which stands for [[progressive scan]] and is important for transmission formats) is irrelevant for labeling digital display resolutions.\n\nIn the mid 2000s, when the digital HD technology and standard debuted on the market, this type of resolution was very often and commonly referred to (both by the public and by the marketers) by its friendlier branded and certified name '''[[HD ready]]'''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFew screens have been built that actually use this resolution natively. Most employ 16:9 panels with 768 lines instead ([[#WXGA|WXGA]]), which resulted in odd numbers of pixels per line, i.e. 1365{{sfrac|1|3}} are rounded to 1360, 1364, 1366 or even 1376, the next multiple of 16.\n\n=== {{resx|1280|1080}} ===\n{{resx|1280|1080}} is the resolution of Panasonic's [[DVCPRO HD]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/chapter_3_section_6.html |title = DVCPRO HD Format Specifications |publisher = [[Apple, Inc.]] |access-date = 2018-10-01 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181316/https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/chapter_3_section_6.html |archive-date = 2010-02-16 }}</ref> Format, as well as DV Camcorders using this format, and their TFT LCD screens.

Please do not change the header to \"UHDTV1\", \"UHD-1\", or simply \"UHD\" etc. without consulting the talk page.\n\nPlease note that \"UHDTV1\" is an entire video system/format, not a resolution. It is defined in SMPTE ST 2036-1 and includes specifications for things like frame rate, color depth, and colorimetry, etc. While 3840 \u00d7 2160 is the resolution used by the UHDTV1 format, \"UHDTV1\" itself is NOT just a name for that resolution. This section is about the resolution 3840 \u00d7 2160, not the UHDTV1 format, and the section header should reflect that. Similarly, \"UHD-1\" is a broadcasting standard from DVB, the \"Ultra HD\" (or UHD) standard from CTA encompasses multiple resolutions and isn't a specific name for 3840\u00d72160, and the \"4K UHDTV\" system defined in BT.2020 is, again, a fully-defined image system, not just a name for the resolution used by that system.\n\nDo NOT rename the header to include UHDTV1, 4K UHDTV, etc. \"4K UHD\" is included because it is a term commonly used to identify this resolution, even though it is not a name established by any particular standard. This is consistent with the names of other section headers, such as \"QHD\", which is commonly used to identify 2560 \u00d7 1440 even though the name is not established by any official standard. \"UHDTV1\" and \"UHD-1\" and \"4K UHDTV\" are NOT commonly used to identify this resolution, so they are not included in the header. Discuss on the talk page before making any changes.\n\nIn addition, please do not try to purge all association of the term \"4K\" with this resolution. The \"3840\u00d72160 isn't really 4K, 4K refers specifically to 4096\u00d72160\" idea is a myth with no basis in fact. You will find that there are no authoritative sources which suggest this idea, it is perpetuated only by articles written by consumer journalists following the publication of the UHDTV standards, who rushed to be the first to write a \"4K and UHD explained\" article with only some cursory Google research. Please refer to the 4K resolution page for citations in this matter, or discuss any objections to this point on the talk page before making any changes to the live article here.\n\n-->\n{{main|4K resolution}}\nThis resolution, sometimes referred to as '''4K UHD''' or '''4K{{resx}}2K''', has a 16:9 aspect ratio and 8,294,400 pixels.

QVGA displays were most often used in [[mobile phone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA), and some [[handheld game console]]s. Often the displays are in a \"[[portrait]]\" orientation (i.e., taller than they are wide, as opposed to \"[[landscape]]\") and are referred to as {{resx|240|320}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/qvga.html |title=QVGA (Quarter Video Graphics Array) |publisher=Independent Media |work=Tech-FAQ |accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref>\n\nThe name comes from having a '''q'''uarter of the {{resx|640|480}} maximum resolution of the original [[IBM]] '''[[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]''' display technology, which became a de facto industry standard in the late 1980s. QVGA is not a standard mode offered by the [[video BIOS|VGA BIOS]], even though VGA and compatible [[graphics processing unit|chipsets]] support a QVGA-sized [[Mode X]]. The term refers only to the display's resolution and thus the abbreviated term QVGA or Quarter VGA is more appropriate to use.\n\nQVGA resolution is also used in [[digital video]] recording equipment as a low-resolution mode requiring less data storage capacity than higher resolutions, typically in still [[digital camera]]s with video recording capability, and some [[mobile phone]]s. Each frame is an image of {{resx|320|240}} pixels. QVGA video is typically recorded at 15 or 30 [[frame rate|frames per second]]. QVGA mode describes the size of an image in pixels, commonly called the resolution; numerous [[digital container format|video file format]]s support this resolution.\n\nWhile QVGA is a ''lower'' resolution than VGA, at higher resolutions the \"Q\" prefix commonly means ''quad(ruple)'' or four times ''higher'' display resolution (e.g., [[#QXGA (2048\u00d71536)|QXGA]] is four times higher resolution than [[#XGA (1024\u00d7768)|XGA]]). To distinguish ''quarter'' from ''quad'', lowercase \"q\" is sometimes used for \"quarter\" and uppercase \"Q\" for \"Quad\", by analogy with [[Metric prefix|SI prefix]]es like m/M and p/P, but this is not a consistent usage.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Accurate Power Estimation of LCD Panels for Notebook Design of Low-Cost 2.2-inch qVGA LTPS TFT-LCD Panel |first=Min-Seok |last=Shin |first2=Jung-Whan |last2=Choi |first3=Yong-Jae |last3=Kim |first4=Kyong-Rok |last4=Kim |first5=Inhwan |last5=Lee |first6=Oh-Kyong |last6=Kwon |journal=SID 2007 Digest |volume=38 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=260\u2013263}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of devices that use QVGA display resolution include, [[Samsung i5500]], [[LG Optimus L3]]-E400, [[Samsung Galaxy Fit|Galaxy Fit]], [[Samsung Galaxy Y|Y]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Pocket|Pocket]], [[HTC Wildfire]], [[Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini]] and [[Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini|mini pro]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]' bottom screen.\n\n{{anchor|WQVGA|WQVGA (400x240)|WQVGA (400\u00d7240)}}\n=== {{resx|400|240}} (WQVGA) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of WQVGA\n!

This definition is consistent with other 'wide' versions of computer displays.\n\nSince QVGA is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high (aspect ratio of 4:3), the resolution of a WQVGA screen might be {{resx|360|240}} (3:2 aspect ratio), {{resx|384|240}} (16:10 aspect ratio), {{resx|400|240}} (5:3 \u2013 such as the [[Nintendo 3DS]] screen or the maximum resolution in [[YouTube]] at 240p), {{resx|428|240}} (\u224816:9 ratio) or {{resx|432|240}} (18:10 aspect ratio). As with [[#WVGA (800\u00d7480)|WVGA]], exact ratios of ''n'':9 are difficult because of the way VGA controllers internally deal with pixels. For instance, when using graphical combinatorial operations on pixels, VGA controllers will use 1 bit per pixel. Since bits cannot be accessed individually but by chunks of 16 or an even higher power of 2, this limits the horizontal resolution to a 16-pixel granularity, i.e., the horizontal resolution must be divisible by 16. In the case of 16:9 ratio, with 240 pixels high, the horizontal resolution should be 240 / 9 \u00d7 16 = 426.{{overline|6}}, the closest multiple of 16 is 432.\n\nWQVGA has also been used to describe displays that are not 240 pixels high, for example [[Sixteenth HD1080]] displays which are 480 pixels wide and 270 or 272 pixels high. This may be due to WQVGA having the nearest screen height.\n\nWQVGA resolutions were commonly used in [[touchscreen]] mobile phones, such as {{resx|400|240}}, {{resx|432|240}}, and {{resx|480|240}}. For example, the [[Hyundai MB 490i]], Sony Ericsson Aino and the Samsung Instinct have WQVGA screen resolutions \u2013 {{resx|240|432}}. Other devices such as the Apple [[iPod Nano]] also use a WQVGA screen, {{resx|240|376}} pixels.\n\n{{anchor|HVGA|HVGA (480x320)|HVGA (480\u00d7320)}}\n=== {{resx|480|320}} (HVGA) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of HVGA\n!

Unlike VGA \u2013 a purely IBM-defined standard \u2013 Super VGA was defined by the [[Video Electronics Standards Association]] (VESA), an open consortium set up to promote interoperability and define standards.

This enables it to fit within a [[framebuffer]] of 512{{nbsp}}[[Kilobyte|KB]] (512 \u00d7 2{{sup|10}} bytes), and the common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to [[Data structure alignment|alignment]].

Later it became the most common appellation of the {{resx|1024|768}} pixels [[display resolution]], but the official definition is broader than that. It was not a new and improved replacement for [[Super VGA]], but rather became one particular subset of the broad range of capabilities covered under the \"Super VGA\" umbrella.\n\nThe initial version of XGA (and its predecessor, the [[IBM 8514|IBM 8514/A]]) expanded upon IBM's older [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] by adding support for four new screen modes (three, for the 8514/A), including one new resolution:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-xga-graphics-chip |last=Necasek |first=Michal |title=The XGA Graphics Chip |work=The OS/2 Museum |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref>\n* {{resx|640|480}} pixels in direct 16 bits-per-pixel (65,536 color) RGB [[highcolor|hi-color]] (XGA only, with 1{{nbsp}}MB [[VRAM|video memory]] option) and 8 bpp (256 color) [[Palette (computing)|palette]]-indexed mode.\n* {{resx|1024|768}} pixels with a 16- or 256-color (4 or 8 bpp) [[Palette (computing)|palette]], using a low frequency [[interlaced]] refresh rate (again, the higher 8 bpp mode required 1{{nbsp}}MB VRAM<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-8514a-graphics-accelerator |last=Necasek |first=Michal |title=The 8514/A Graphics Accelerators |work=The OS/2 Museum |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref>).\n\nLike the 8514, XGA offered '''fixed function''' [[hardware acceleration]] to offload processing of 2D drawing tasks. Both adapters allowed offloading of line-draw, bitmap-copy ([[bitblt]]), and color-fill operations from the host [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. XGA's acceleration was faster than 8514's, and more comprehensive, supporting more drawing primitives, the VGA-res hi-color mode, versatile \"brush\" and \"mask\" modes, system memory addressing functions, and a single simple hardware sprite typically used to providing a low CPU load mouse pointer. It was also capable of wholly independent function, as it incorporated support for all existing VGA functions and modes \u2013 the 8514 itself was a simpler add-on adapter that required a separate VGA to be present. As they were designed for use with IBM's own range of fixed-frequency monitors, neither adapter offered support for {{resx|800|600}} [[SVGA]] modes.\n\n'''XGA-2''' added a 24-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]], but this was used only to extend the available master palette in 256-color mode, e.g. to allow true 256-greyscale output instead of the 64 grey levels previously available; there was still no direct [[24-bit color|True Color]] mode despite the adapter featuring enough default onboard VRAM (1{{nbsp}}MB) to support it. Other improvements included provision of the previously missing {{resx|800|600}} resolution (using an SVGA or multisync monitor) in up to 65,536 colors, faster screen refresh rates in all modes (including non-interlace, flicker-free output for {{resx|1024|768}}), and improved accelerator performance and versatility.\n\nIBM licensed the XGA technology and architecture to certain third party hardware developers, and its characteristic modes (although not necessarily the accelerator functions, nor the MCA data-bus interface) were aped by many others. These accelerators typically did not suffer from the same limitations on available resolutions and refresh rate, and featured other now-standard modes like {{resx|800|600}} (and {{resx|1280|1024}}) at various color depths (up to 24 bpp Truecolor) and interlaced, non-interlaced and flicker-free refresh rates even before the release of the XGA-2.\n\nAll standard XGA modes have a [[4:3]] [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] with square pixels, although this does not hold for certain standard VGA and third-party extended modes ({{resx|640|400}}, {{resx|1280|1024}}).\n\nXGA should not be confused with '''EVGA''' ([[Extended Video Graphics Array]]), a contemporaneous [[VESA]] standard that also has {{resx|1024|768}} pixels.

The basis for this otherwise odd seeming resolution is similar to that of other \"wide\" standards \u2013 the line scan (refresh) rate of the well-established \"XGA\" standard ({{resx|1024|768}} pixels, 4:3 aspect) extended to give square pixels on the increasingly popular 16:9 widescreen display ratio without having to effect major signalling changes other than a faster pixel clock, or manufacturing changes other than extending panel width by one third. As 768 does not divide exactly into 9, the aspect ratio is not ''quite'' 16:9 \u2013 this would require a horizontal width of 1365{{1/3}} pixels. However, at only 0.05%, the resulting error is insignificant.\n\nIn 2006, {{resx|1366|768}} was the most popular resolution for [[liquid crystal display television]]s (versus XGA for [[Plasma display|Plasma]] TVs [[flat panel display]]s);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/Public/Panel%20Standards/TVpnlV1.pdf |title=TV Panels Standard |publisher=VESA |format=PDF |date=10 March 2006 |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209101345/http://www.vesa.org/Public/Panel%20Standards/TVpnlV1.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} by 2013, even this was relegated to only being used in smaller or cheaper displays (e.g. \"bedroom\" LCD TVs, or low-cost, large-format plasmas), cheaper laptop and mobile tablet computers, and midrange home cinema projectors, having otherwise been overtaken by higher \"full HD\" resolutions such as {{resx|1920|1080}}.\n\n{{anchor|1360x768|1360\u00d7768}}\n==== {{resx|1360|768}} ====\nA common variant on this resolution is {{resx|1360|768}}, which confers several technical benefits, most significantly a reduction in memory requirements from just over to just under 1{{nbsp}}MB per 8-bit channel ({{resx|1366|768}} needs 1024.5{{nbsp}}KB per channel; {{resx|1360|768}} needs 1020{{nbsp}}KB; 1{{nbsp}}MB is equal to 1024{{nbsp}}KB), which simplifies architecture and can significantly reduce the amount\u2013and speed\u2013of VRAM required with only a very minor change in available resolution, as memory chips are usually only available in fixed megabyte capacities. For example, at 32-bit color, a {{resx|1360|768}} framebuffer would require only 4{{nbsp}}MB, whilst a {{resx|1366|768}} one may need 5, 6 or even 8{{nbsp}}MB depending on the exact display circuitry architecture and available chip capacities. The 6-pixel reduction also means each line's width is divisible by 8 pixels, simplifying numerous routines used in both computer and broadcast/theatrical video processing, which operate on 8-pixel blocks. Historically, many video cards also mandated screen widths divisible by 8 for their lower-color, planar modes to accelerate memory accesses and simplify pixel position calculations (e.g. fetching 4-bit pixels from 32-bit memory is much faster when performed 8 pixels at a time, and calculating exactly where a particular pixel is within a memory block is much easier when lines do not end partway through a memory word), and this convention still persisted in low-end hardware even into the early days of widescreen, LCD HDTVs; thus, most 1366-width displays also quietly support display of 1360-width material, with a thin border of unused pixel columns at each side. This narrower mode is of course even further removed from the 16:9 ideal, but the error is still less than 0.5% (technically, the mode is either 15.94:9.00 or 16.00:9.04) and should be imperceptible.\n\n{{anchor|1280x800|1280\u00d7800}}\n==== {{resx|1280|800}} ====\nWhen referring to laptop displays or independent displays and projectors intended primarily for use with computers, WXGA is also used to describe a resolution of {{resx|1280|800}} pixels, with an aspect ratio of [[16:10]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/press/AsiaTourOct05.pdf |title=VESA Asia Briefings |publisher=VESA |date=October 2005 |format=PDF |page=21 |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215105033/http://www.vesa.org/press/AsiaTourOct05.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dell.com/content/learnmore/learnmore.aspx?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd&~id=screen&~line=notebooks&~mode=popup&~model=d800&~series=latit&ref=CFG |title=LEARN MORE LCD Displays |publisher=Dell |accessdate=2013-05-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/merchandising/us/specialoffers/popups/help_me_decide/popup_helpme_display.html |title=Help Me Decide |publisher=Lenovo |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192233/http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/merchandising/us/specialoffers/popups/help_me_decide/popup_helpme_display.html |archivedate=2014-01-02}}</ref> This was once particularly popular for laptop screens, usually with a diagonal screen size of between 12 and 15 inches, as it provided a useful compromise between 4:3 XGA and 16:9 WXGA, with improved resolution in ''both'' dimensions vs. the old standard (especially useful in portrait mode, or for displaying two standard pages of text side by side), a perceptibly \"wider\" appearance and the ability to display 720p HD video \"native\" with only very thin letterbox borders (usable for on-screen playback controls) and no stretching. Additionally, like {{resx|1360|768}}, it required only 1000{{nbsp}}KB (just under 1{{nbsp}}MB) of memory per 8-bit channel; thus, a typical double-buffered 32-bit colour screen could fit within 8{{nbsp}}MB, limiting everyday demands on the complexity (and cost, energy use) of integrated graphics chipsets and their shared use of typically sparse system memory (generally allocated to the video system in relatively large blocks), at least when only the internal display was in use (external monitors generally being supported in \"extended desktop\" mode to at least {{resx|1600|1200}} resolution). 16:10 (or 8:5) is itself a rather \"classic\" computer aspect ratio, harking back all the way to early {{resx|320|200}} modes (and their derivatives) as seen in the Commodore 64, IBM CGA card and others. However, as of mid 2013, this standard is becoming increasingly rare, crowded out by the more standardised and thus more economical-to-produce {{resx|1366|768}} panels, as its previously beneficial features become less important with improvements to hardware, gradual loss of general backwards software compatibility, and changes in interface layout. As of August 2013, the market availability of panels with {{resx|1280|800}} native resolution had been generally relegated to data projectors or niche products such as convertible tablet PCs and LCD-based eBook readers.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}\n\n{{anchor|WXGA_HD|1280x768}}\n==== Others ====\nAdditionally, at least two other resolutions are sometimes labelled as WXGA:\n\n* First, the [[HDTV]]-standard {{resx|1280|720}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=22206&vpn=EY.J4401.007&manufacture=Acer |title=Acer PH530 HDTV DLP Projector |publisher=NCIX |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429023140/http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=22206&vpn=EY.J4401.007&manufacture=Acer |archivedate=2012-04-29}}</ref> (otherwise commonly described as \"[[720p]]\"), which offers an exact 16:9 aspect with square pixels; naturally, it displays standard 720p HD video material without stretching or letterboxing and 1080i/1080p with a simple 2:3 downscale. This resolution has found some use in tablets and modern, high-pixel-density mobile phones, as well as small-format \"netbook\" or \"ultralight\" laptop computers. However, its use is uncommon in larger, mainstream devices as it has insufficient vertical resolution for the proper use of modern operating systems such as Windows 7 whose UI design assumes a minimum of 768 lines. For certain uses such as word processing, it can even be considered a slight downgrade (reducing number of simultaneously visible lines of text without granting any significant benefit as even 640 pixels is sufficient horizontal resolution to legibly render a full page width, especially with the addition of subpixel anti-aliasing).\n* The second variant, {{resx|1280|768}}, can be seen as a compromise resolution that addressed this problem, as well as a halfway point between the older {{resx|1024|768}} and {{resx|1280|1024}} resolutions, and a stepping stone to {{resx|1366|768}} (being one-quarter wider than 1024, not one-third) and {{resx|1280|800}}, that never quite caught on in the same way as either of its arguably derivative successors. Its square-pixel aspect ratio is 15:9, in contrast to HDTV's 16:9 and {{resx|1280|800}}'s 16:10. It is also the lowest resolution that might be found in an \"Ultrabook\" standard laptop, as it satisfies the minimum horizontal and vertical pixel resolutions required to officially qualify for the designation.\n* Other mentionable resolutions are {{resx|1152|768}} with 3:2 aspect ratio, and {{resx|1344|768}} with 7:4 aspect ratio (similar to 16:9).\nWidespread availability of {{resx|1280|800}} and {{resx|1366|768}} pixel resolution LCDs for laptop monitors can be considered an [[operating system|OS]]-driven evolution from the formerly popular {{resx|1024|768}} screen size, which has itself since seen UI design feedback in response to what could be considered disadvantages of the widescreen format when used with programs designed for \"traditional\" screens. In [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] specifically, the larger [[task bar]] of Windows Vista and 7 occupies an additional 16 pixel lines by default, which may compromise the usability of programs that already demanded a full {{resx|1024|768}} (instead of, e.g. {{resx|800|600}}) unless it is specifically set to use small icons; an \"oddball\" 784-line resolution would compensate for this, but {{resx|1280|800}} has a simpler aspect and also gives the slight bonus of 16 ''more'' usable lines. Also, the [[Windows Sidebar]] in [[Windows Vista]] and 7 can use the additional 256 or 336 horizontal pixels to display informational \"widgets\" without compromising the display width of other programs, and Windows 8 is specifically designed around a \"two pane\" concept where the full 16:9 or 16:10 screen is not required. Typically, this consists of a 4:3 main program area (typically {{resx|1024|768}}, {{resx|1000|800}} or {{resx|1440|1080}}) plus a narrow sidebar running a second program, showing a toolbox for the main program or a pop-out OS shortcut panel taking up the remainder.\n* Some {{resx|1440|900}} resolution displays have also been found labeled as WXGA; however, the correct label is actually [[#WXGA+ (1440\u00d7900)|WSXGA or WXGA+]].\n\n{{anchor|XGAplus|XGA+ (1152x864)|XGA+ (1152\u00d7864)|megapixel}}\n\n=== {{resx|1152|864}} (XGA+) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of XGA+\n!

Until the advent of widescreen [[LCD]]s, XGA+ was often used on 17-inch desktop [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. It is the highest 4:3 resolution not greater than 2{{sup|20}} pixels (\u22481.05{{nbsp}}[[megapixel]]s), with its horizontal dimension a multiple of 32 pixels. This enables it to fit closely into a video memory or framebuffer of 1{{nbsp}}[[Megabyte|MB]] (1 \u00d7 2{{sup|20}} [[byte]]s), assuming the use of one byte per pixel. The common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to [[Data structure alignment|alignment]].\n\nHistorically, the resolution also relates to the earlier standard of {{resx|1152|900}} pixels, which was adopted by [[Sun Microsystems]] for the [[Sun-2]] [[workstation]] in the early 1980s. A decade later, [[Apple Computer]] selected the resolution of {{resx|1152|870}} for their 21-inch CRT monitors, intended for use as two-page displays on the [[Macintosh II]] computer. These resolutions are even closer to the limit of a 1{{nbsp}}MB framebuffer, but their aspect ratios differ slightly from the common 4:3.\n\nXGA+ is the next step after [[#XGA|XGA]] ({{resx|1024|768}}), although it is not approved by any standard organizations. The next step with an aspect ratio of 4:3 is {{resx|1280|960}} (\"[[#SXGAminus|SXGA-]]\") or [[#SXGAplus|SXGA+]] ({{resx|1400|1050}}).\n\n{{anchor|WXGAplus|WSXGA|WXGA+ (1440x900)|WXGA+ (1440\u00d7900)}}\n=== {{resx|1440|900}} (WXGA+, WSXGA) ===\n'''WXGA+''' and '''WSXGA''' are non-standard terms referring to a computer display resolution of {{resx|1440|900}}.

The aspect ratios of each are [[16:10]] ([[widescreen]]).\n\nWXGA+ ({{resx|1440|900}}) resolution is common in 19-inch widescreen desktop monitors (a very small number of such monitors use [[#WSXGA+ (1680\u00d71050)|WSXGA+]]), and is also optional, although less common, in [[laptop]] LCDs, in sizes ranging from 12.1 to 17 inches.\n\nAnother resolution going by this name is {{resx|1440|960}}, at an aspect ratio of 15:10 ([[widescreen]]).\n\n{{anchor|SXGA|SXGAminus|SXGA (1280x1024)|SXGA (1280\u00d71024)}}\n=== {{resx|1280|1024}} (SXGA) ===\n'''Super Extended Graphics Array''' ('''SXGA''') is a standard monitor resolution of {{resx|1280|1024}} pixels. This [[display resolution]] is the \"next step\" above the XGA resolution that [[IBM]] developed in 1990.\n\nThe {{resx|1280|1024}} resolution is not the standard 4:3 aspect ratio, but 5:4 (1.25:1 instead of 1.333:1). A standard 4:3 monitor using this resolution will have rectangular rather than square pixels, meaning that unless the software compensates for this the picture will be distorted, causing circles to appear elliptical.\n\nThere is a less common {{resx|1280|960}} resolution that preserves the common 4:3 aspect ratio. It is sometimes unofficially called '''SXGA\u2212''' to avoid confusion with the \"standard\" SXGA. Elsewhere this 4:3 resolution was also called '''UVGA''' (''Ultra VGA''): Since both sides are doubled from VGA the term ''Quad VGA'' would be a systematic one, but it is hardly ever used, because its initialism [[#QVGA|QVGA]] is strongly associated with the alternate meaning ''Quarter VGA'' ({{resx|320|240}}).\n\nSXGA is the most common native resolution of 17 inch and 19 inch [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors. An LCD monitor with SXGA native resolution will typically have a physical 5:4 aspect ratio, preserving a 1:1 [[pixel aspect ratio]].\n\n[[Sony]] manufactured a 17-inch [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor with a 5:4 aspect ratio designed for this resolution. It was sold under the Apple brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nSXGA is also a popular resolution for cell phone cameras, such as the Motorola Razr and most Samsung and LG phones. Although being taken over by newer UXGA (2.0-megapixel) cameras, the 1.3-megapixel was the most common around 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAny CRT that can run {{resx|1280|1024}} can also run {{resx|1280|960}}, which has the standard 4:3 ratio. A flat panel [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|TFT]] screen, including one designed for {{resx|1280|1024}}, will show stretching distortion when set to display any resolution other than its native one, as the image needs to be interpolated to fit in the fixed grid display. Some TFT displays do not allow a user to disable this, and will prevent the upper and lower portions of the screen from being used forcing a \"[[Letterboxing (filming)|letterbox]]\" format when set to a 4:3 ratio.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe {{resx|1280|1024}} resolution became popular because at [[24-bit color|24{{nbsp}}bit/px color depth]] it fit well into 4 [[megabyte]]s of [[video RAM]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} At the time, memory was extremely expensive.

Models like the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2045U and IBM ThinkVision C220P retailed for around US$200, and even higher performance ones like the ViewSonic PerfectFlat P220fB remained under $500. At one time, many off-lease P1230s could be found on eBay for under $150. The LCDs with WQXGA or QXGA resolution typically cost four to five times more for the same resolution. [[International Display Technology|IDTech]] manufactured a 15-inch QXGA [[E-IPS|IPS]] panel, used in the IBM [[ThinkPad]] R50p. NEC sold laptops with QXGA screens in 2002\u201305 for the Japanese market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/ja/0207/0101.html |publisher=NEC |script-title=ja:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |date=1 July 2002 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/ja/0501/1901.html |publisher=NEC |script-title=ja:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |date=19 January 2005 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The [[iPad]] (starting from [[iPad (3rd generation)|3rd generation]]) also has a QXGA display.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17292424 |title=Apple unveils new iPad with high-definition screen |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|WQXGA|WQXGA (2560x1600)|WQXGA (2560\u00d71600)}}\n=== {{resx|2560|1600}} (WQXGA) ===\n{{distinguish|text=QWXGA}}\n\n'''WQXGA''' ('''Wide Quad Extended Graphics Array''') is a [[display resolution]] of {{resx|2560|1600}} pixels with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The name comes from it being a wide version of QXGA and having four times as many pixels as an [[#WXGA (1280\u00d7768)|WXGA]] ({{resx|1280|800}}) display.\n\nTo obtain a vertical refresh rate higher than 40{{nbsp}}Hz with [[DVI]], this resolution requires [[Dual-link DVI|dual-link]] DVI cables and devices. To avoid cable problems monitors are sometimes shipped with an appropriate dual link cable already plugged in. Many [[video cards]] support this resolution. One feature that is currently unique to the 30{{nbsp}}inch WQXGA monitors is the ability to function as the centerpiece and main display of a three-monitor array of complementary aspect ratios, with two [[#UXGA (1600\u00d71200)|UXGA]] ({{resx|1600|1200}}) 20-inch monitors turned vertically on either side. The resolutions are equal, and the size of the 1600 resolution edges (if the manufacturer is honest) is within a tenth of an inch (16-inch vs. 15.899<small>99</small>\"), presenting a \"picture window view\" without the extreme lateral dimensions, small central panel, asymmetry, resolution differences, or dimensional difference of other three-monitor combinations. The resulting {{resx|4960|1600}} composite image has a 3.1:1 aspect ratio. This also means one UXGA 20-inch monitor in portrait orientation can also be flanked by two 30-inch WQXGA monitors for a {{resx|6320|1600}} composite image with an 11.85:3 (79:20, 3.95:1) aspect ratio. Some WQXGA medical displays (such as the Barco Coronis 4MP) can also be configured as two virtual {{resx|1200|1600}} or {{resx|1280|1600}} seamless displays by using both DVI ports at the same time.\n\nAn early consumer WQXGA monitor was the 30-inch Apple Cinema Display, unveiled by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in June 2004. At the time, dual-link DVI was uncommon on consumer hardware, so Apple partnered with [[Nvidia]] to develop a special graphics card that had two dual-link DVI ports, allowing simultaneous use of two 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays. The nature of this graphics card, being an add-in AGP card, meant that the monitors could only be used in a desktop computer, like the Power Mac G5, that could have the add-in card installed, and could not be immediately used with laptop computers that lacked this expansion capability.\n\nIn 2010, WQXGA made its debut in a handful of home theater projectors targeted at the Constant Height Screen application market. Both Digital Projection Inc and projectiondesign released models based on a [[Texas Instruments]] DLP chip with a native WQXGA resolution, alleviating the need for an anamorphic lens to achieve 1:2.35 image projection. Many manufacturers have 27\u201330-inch models that are capable of WQXGA, albeit at a much higher price than lower resolution monitors of the same size. Several mainstream WQXGA monitors are or were available with 30-inch displays, such as the [[Dell monitors|Dell]] 3007WFP-HC, 3008WFP, U3011, U3014, UP3017, the [[Hewlett-Packard]] LP3065, the [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] XHD3000, [[LG]] W3000H, and the [[Samsung]] 305T. Specialist manufacturers like [[NEC]], [[Eizo]], [[Planar Systems]], [[Barco NV|Barco]] (LC-3001), and possibly others offer similar models. As of 2016, [[LG Display]] make a 10-bit 30-inch AH-IPS panel, with wide color gamut, used in monitors from Dell, NEC, HP, Lenovo and Iiyama.\n\nReleased in November 2012, Google's [[Nexus 10]] is the first consumer [[tablet computer|tablet]] to feature WQXGA resolution. Before its release, the highest resolution available on a tablet was QXGA ({{resx|2048|1536}}), available on the Apple [[iPad]] 3rd and 4th generations devices. Several Samsung Galaxy tablets, including the Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), Tab S 8.4, 10.5 and TabPRO 8.4, 10.1 and Note Pro 12.2, as well as the Gigaset QV1030, also feature a WQXGA resolution display.\n\nIn 2012, Apple released the 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display that features a WQXGA display, and the new MacBook Air in 2018.\n\n{{anchor|QSXGA|QSXGA (2560x2048)|QSXGA (2560\u00d72048)}}\n=== {{resx|2560|2048}} (QSXGA) ===\n'''QSXGA''' ('''Quad Super Extended Graphics Array''') is a display resolution of {{resx|2560|2048}} pixels with a 5:4 aspect ratio. Grayscale monitors with a {{resx|2560|2048}} resolution, primarily for medical use, are available from [[Planar Systems]] (Dome E5), [[Eizo]] (Radiforce G51), [[Barco NV|Barco]] (Nio 5, MP), [[Wide-angle Infinity Display Equipment|WIDE]] (IF2105MP), [[International Display Technology|IDTech]] (IAQS80F), and possibly others.\n\nRecent medical displays such as Barco Coronis Fusion 10MP or NDS Dome S10 have native panel resolution of {{resx|4096|2560}}. These are driven by two dual-link DVI or [[DisplayPort]] outputs. They can be considered to be two seamless virtual QSXGA displays as they have to be driven simultaneously by both dual link DVI or DisplayPort since one dual link DVI or DisplayPort cannot single-handedly display 10 megapixels. A similar resolution of {{resx|2560|1920}} (4:3) was supported by a small number of CRT displays via VGA such as the Viewsonic P225f when paired with the right graphics card.\n\n{{anchor|WQSXGA|WQSXGA (3200x2048)|WQSXGA (3200\u00d72048)}}\n=== {{resx|3200|2048}} (WQSXGA) ===\n'''WQSXGA''' ('''Wide Quad Super Extended Graphics Array''') describes a display standard that can support a resolution up to {{resx|3200|2048}} pixels, assuming a 1.5625:1 (25:16) aspect ratio. The Coronis Fusion 6MP DL by [[Barco NV|Barco]] supports {{resx|3280|2048}} (approximately 16:10).\n\n{{anchor|QUXGA|QUXGA (3200x2400)|QUXGA (3200\u00d72400)}}\n=== {{resx|3200|2400}} (QUXGA) ===\n'''QUXGA''' ('''Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array''') describes a display standard that can support a resolution up to {{resx|3200|2400}} pixels, assuming a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\n{{anchor|WQUXGA|WQUXGA (3840x2400)|WQUXGA (3840\u00d72400)}}\n=== {{resx|3840|2400}} (WQUXGA) ===\n'''WQUXGA''' ('''Wide Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array''') describes a display standard that supports a resolution of {{resx|3840|2400}} pixels, which provides a 16:10 aspect ratio. This resolution is exactly four times {{resx|1920|1200}} (in pixels).\n\nMost [[Graphics card|display cards]] with a DVI connector are capable of supporting the {{resx|3840|2400}} resolution. However, the maximum refresh rate will be limited by the number of DVI links which are connected to the monitor. 1, 2, or 4 DVI connectors are used to drive the monitor using various tile configurations. Only the IBM T221-DG5 and IDTech MD22292B5 support the use of dual-link DVI ports through an external converter box. Many systems using these monitors use at least two DVI connectors to send video to the monitor. These DVI connectors can be from the same graphics card, different graphics cards, or even different computers. Motion across the tile boundary(ies) can show [[screen tearing|tearing]] if the DVI links are not synchronized. The display panel can be updated at a speed between 0{{nbsp}}Hz and 41{{nbsp}}Hz (48{{nbsp}}Hz for the IBM T221-DG5, -DGP, and IDTech MD22292B5). The refresh rate of the video signal can be higher than 41{{nbsp}}Hz (or 48{{nbsp}}Hz) but the monitor will not update the display any faster even if graphics card(s) do so.\n\nIn June 2001, WQUXGA was introduced in the [[IBM T220]] LCD monitor using a LCD panel built by [[International Display Technology|IDTech]]. LCD displays that support WQUXGA resolution include: [[IBM T220]], [[IBM T221]], [[Iiyama (company)|Iiyama]] AQU5611DTBK, [[ViewSonic]] [[VP2290]],<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.viewsonic.com/companyinfo/pressrelease_detail.cfm?key_press_release=155 |title=ViewSonic Brings World's Highest Resolution Monitor To Its LCD Lineup |publisher=ViewSonic |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021207180615/http://www.viewsonic.com/companyinfo/pressrelease_detail.cfm?key_press_release=155 |archivedate=2002-12-07}}</ref> ADTX MD22292B, and [[International Display Technology|IDTech]] MD22292 (models B0, B1, B2, B5, C0, C2).

The [[iPhone X]] introduced a 2436 \u00d7 1125 resolution (with a notch) at an aspect ratio of roughly 13:6 or, for marketing, 19.5:9.\n\nOther manufacturers have also introduced phones with irregular display resolutions and aspect ratios, e.g. Samsung's various ''Infinity'' displays with 37:18 = {{sfrac|18|1|2}}:9 ([[Samsung Galaxy S8|Galaxy S8]]/[[Samsung Galaxy S9|S9]] and [[Samsung Galaxy A8|A8]]/[[Samsung Galaxy A9|A9]]), i.e. 2960 \u00d7 1440 (Quad HD+, WQHD+) or 2220 \u00d7 1080 (Full HD+), and 19:9 ([[Samsung Galaxy S10|S10]]) aspect ratios: 3040 \u00d7 1440 and 2280 \u00d7 1080 (S10e).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of common resolutions]]\n* [[Ultrawide formats]] for history and comparison of video formats and displays, which are growing wider\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Computer display standard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphic Display Resolutions}}\n[[Category:Computer display standards]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Width and height of an electronic visual display device, such as a computer monitor, in pixels}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=March 2017}}\n{{lead too short|date=March 2017}}\n{{Overlinked|date=December 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:Video Resolution Chart.svg|thumb|A chart showing the number of pixels in different display resolutions]]\n\nThe '''graphics display resolution''' is the width and height dimension of an [[electronic visual display]] device, such as a [[computer monitor]], in [[pixel]]s.

Just because you have come up with a naming convention that you think is logical and perhaps SHOULD be used, Wikipedia is not the place for you to try to push your proposal forward by trying to pass it off as an industry-wide consensus or official standard.\n\nPlease do not add made-up calculator resolutions or made-up names to this table.\n\n-->\n\n== Aspect ratio ==\n[[File:Vector Video Standards2.svg|350px|right|thumb|Multiple display standards compared.]]\n{{main|Display aspect ratio}}\nThe favored aspect ratio of mass market display industry products has changed gradually from 4:3, then to 16:10, then to 16:9, and now changing to 18:9 for phones,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techtippr.com/18-by-9-aspect-ratio-in-smartphones-is-the-new-trend |title=18:9 Aspect Ratio in Smartphones will be the new Standard in 2018, Here\u2019s why |last=Ahmed |first=Asif |date=13 November 2017 |publisher=Techtippr |accessdate=2018-10-01}}</ref> and 21:9 for monitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/samsung-chg90-monitor-advantages-2017-6 |title=Playing games on Samsung\u2019s massive new computer monitor and other ultra-wide monitors gives you an advantage |last=Villas-Boas |first=Antonio |date=12 June 2017 |publisher=Business Insider Singapore |accessdate=2018-10-01}}</ref> The 4:3 aspect ratio generally reflects older products, especially the era of the cathode ray tube (CRT). The 16:10 aspect ratio had its largest use in the 1995\u20132010 period, and the 16:9 aspect ratio tends to reflect post-2010 mass market computer monitor, laptop, and entertainment products displays.\n\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio was common in older television cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, which were not easily adaptable to a wider aspect ratio. When good quality alternate technologies (i.e., liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and plasma displays) became more available and less costly, around the year 2000, the common computer displays and entertainment products moved to a wider aspect ratio, first to the 16:10 ratio. The 16:10 ratio allowed some compromise between showing older 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows, but also allowing better viewing of widescreen movies. However, around the year 2005, home entertainment displays (i.e., TV sets) gradually moved from 16:10 to the 16:9 aspect ratio, for further improvement of viewing widescreen movies. By about 2007, virtually all mass market entertainment displays were 16:9. In 2011, {{resx|1920|1080}} (Full HD, the native resolution of Blu-ray) was the favored resolution in the most heavily marketed entertainment market displays. The next standard, {{resx|3840|2160}} (4K UHD), was first sold in 2013.\n\nAlso in 2013, displays with {{resx|2560|1080}} (aspect ratio 64:27 or 2.{{overline|370}}, however commonly referred to as \"21:9\" for easy comparison with 16:9) appeared, which closely approximate the common [[CinemaScope]] movie standard aspect ratio of 2.35\u20132.40. In 2014, \"21:9\" screens with pixel dimensions of {{resx|3440|1440}} (actual aspect ratio 43:18 or 2.3{{overline|8}}) became available as well.\n\nThe computer display industry maintained the 16:10 aspect ratio longer than the entertainment industry, but in the 2005\u20132010 period, computers were increasingly marketed as dual use products, with uses in the traditional computer applications, but also as means of viewing entertainment content. In this time frame, with the notable exception of Apple, almost all desktop, laptop, and display manufacturers gradually moved to promoting only 16:9 aspect ratio displays. By 2011, the 16:10 aspect ratio had virtually disappeared from the Windows laptop display market (although Mac laptops are still mostly 16:10, including the {{resx|2880|1800}} 15\" Retina MacBook Pro and the {{resx|2560|1600}} 13\" Retina MacBook Pro). One consequence of this transition was that the highest available resolutions moved generally downward (i.e., the move from {{resx|1920|1200}} laptop displays to {{resx|1920|1080}} displays).\n\n==High-definition==\n{{main|High-definition television}}\n{{see also|Standard-definition television}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" {{ts|ar|sm}}\n|+ High-definition\n!

Pixel doubling (vertically and horizontally) nHD frames will form one 720p frame and pixel tripling nHD frames will form one 1080p frame.\n\nOne drawback of this resolution is that the vertical resolution is not an even multiple of 16, which is a common [[macroblock]] size for [[video codec]]s. Video frames encoded with 16\u00d716 pixel macroblocks would be padded to {{resx|640|368}} and the added pixels would be cropped away at playback. H.264 codecs have this padding and cropping ability built-in as standard. The same is true for qHD and 1080p but the relative amount of padding is more for lower resolutions such as nHD.\n\nTo avoid storing the eight lines of padded pixels, some people prefer to encode video at {{resx|624|352}}, which only has one stored padded line. When such video streams are either encoded from HD frames or played back on HD displays in full screen mode (either 720p or 1080p) they are scaled by non-integer scale factors. True nHD frames on the other hand has integer scale factors, for example Nokia 808 PureView with nHD display.\n\n{{anchor|960x540|qHD|qHD (960x540)|qHD (960\u00d7540)}}\n=== {{resx|960|540}} (qHD) ===\n'''qHD''' is a display resolution of {{resx|960|540}} pixels, which is exactly one quarter of a [[#FHD (1920\u00d71080)|Full HD]] (1080p) frame, in a 16:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]].\n\n<!-- The following sentence is meant to give a few examples, it is not supposed to be a comprehensive list, so please don't keep adding to it indiscriminately. -->\nSimilar to DVGA, this resolution became popular for high-end smartphone displays in early 2011. Mobile phones including the [[Jolla]], [[Sony Xperia C]], [[HTC Sensation]], [[Motorola Droid RAZR]], [[LG Optimus L9]], [[Microsoft Lumia 535]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini]] have displays with the qHD resolution, as does the [[PlayStation Vita]] portable game system.\n\n{{anchor|1280x720|HD|HD (1280x720)|HD (1280\u00d7720)}}\n=== {{resx|1280|720}} (HD) ===\n{{main|720p}}\nThe '''HD''' resolution of {{resx|1280|720}} pixels stems from [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), where it originally used 60 frames per second. With its 16:9 aspect ratio it is exactly 2 times the width and 1{{sfrac|1|2}} times the height of 4:3 [[#VGA (640\u00d7480)|VGA]], which shares its aspect ratio and 480 line count with [[NTSC]]. HD therefore has exactly 3 times as many pixels as VGA.\n\nThis resolution is often referred to as '''[[720p]]''', although the ''p'' (which stands for [[progressive scan]] and is important for transmission formats) is irrelevant for labeling digital display resolutions.\n\nIn the mid 2000s, when the digital HD technology and standard debuted on the market, this type of resolution was very often and commonly referred to (both by the public and by the marketers) by its friendlier branded and certified name '''[[HD ready]]'''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFew screens have been built that actually use this resolution natively. Most employ 16:9 panels with 768 lines instead ([[#WXGA|WXGA]]), which resulted in odd numbers of pixels per line, i.e. 1365{{sfrac|1|3}} are rounded to 1360, 1364, 1366 or even 1376, the next multiple of 16.\n\n=== {{resx|1280|1080}} ===\n{{resx|1280|1080}} is the resolution of Panasonic's [[DVCPRO HD]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/chapter_3_section_6.html |title = DVCPRO HD Format Specifications |publisher = [[Apple, Inc.]] |access-date = 2018-10-01 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181316/https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/chapter_3_section_6.html |archive-date = 2010-02-16 }}</ref> Format, as well as DV Camcorders using this format, and their TFT LCD screens.

Please do not change the header to \"UHDTV1\", \"UHD-1\", or simply \"UHD\" etc. without consulting the talk page.\n\nPlease note that \"UHDTV1\" is an entire video system/format, not a resolution. It is defined in SMPTE ST 2036-1 and includes specifications for things like frame rate, color depth, and colorimetry, etc. While 3840 \u00d7 2160 is the resolution used by the UHDTV1 format, \"UHDTV1\" itself is NOT just a name for that resolution. This section is about the resolution 3840 \u00d7 2160, not the UHDTV1 format, and the section header should reflect that. Similarly, \"UHD-1\" is a broadcasting standard from DVB, the \"Ultra HD\" (or UHD) standard from CTA encompasses multiple resolutions and isn't a specific name for 3840\u00d72160, and the \"4K UHDTV\" system defined in BT.2020 is, again, a fully-defined image system, not just a name for the resolution used by that system.\n\nDo NOT rename the header to include UHDTV1, 4K UHDTV, etc. \"4K UHD\" is included because it is a term commonly used to identify this resolution, even though it is not a name established by any particular standard. This is consistent with the names of other section headers, such as \"QHD\", which is commonly used to identify 2560 \u00d7 1440 even though the name is not established by any official standard. \"UHDTV1\" and \"UHD-1\" and \"4K UHDTV\" are NOT commonly used to identify this resolution, so they are not included in the header. Discuss on the talk page before making any changes.\n\nIn addition, please do not try to purge all association of the term \"4K\" with this resolution. The \"3840\u00d72160 isn't really 4K, 4K refers specifically to 4096\u00d72160\" idea is a myth with no basis in fact. You will find that there are no authoritative sources which suggest this idea, it is perpetuated only by articles written by consumer journalists following the publication of the UHDTV standards, who rushed to be the first to write a \"4K and UHD explained\" article with only some cursory Google research. Please refer to the 4K resolution page for citations in this matter, or discuss any objections to this point on the talk page before making any changes to the live article here.\n\n-->\n{{main|4K resolution}}\nThis resolution, sometimes referred to as '''4K UHD''' or '''4K{{resx}}2K''', has a 16:9 aspect ratio and 8,294,400 pixels.

This section is about the resolution 7680 \u00d7 4320, not the UHDTV2 format, and the section header should reflect that.

This is consistent with the names of other section headers, such as \"QHD\", which is commonly used to identify 2560 \u00d7 1440 even though the name is not established by any official standard. \"UHDTV2\" and \"UHD-2\" and \"8K UHDTV\" are NOT commonly used to identify this resolution, so they are not included in the header.

QVGA displays were most often used in [[mobile phone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA), and some [[handheld game console]]s. Often the displays are in a \"[[portrait]]\" orientation (i.e., taller than they are wide, as opposed to \"[[landscape]]\") and are referred to as {{resx|240|320}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/qvga.html |title=QVGA (Quarter Video Graphics Array) |publisher=Independent Media |work=Tech-FAQ |accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref>\n\nThe name comes from having a '''q'''uarter of the {{resx|640|480}} maximum resolution of the original [[IBM]] '''[[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]''' display technology, which became a de facto industry standard in the late 1980s. QVGA is not a standard mode offered by the [[video BIOS|VGA BIOS]], even though VGA and compatible [[graphics processing unit|chipsets]] support a QVGA-sized [[Mode X]]. The term refers only to the display's resolution and thus the abbreviated term QVGA or Quarter VGA is more appropriate to use.\n\nQVGA resolution is also used in [[digital video]] recording equipment as a low-resolution mode requiring less data storage capacity than higher resolutions, typically in still [[digital camera]]s with video recording capability, and some [[mobile phone]]s. Each frame is an image of {{resx|320|240}} pixels. QVGA video is typically recorded at 15 or 30 [[frame rate|frames per second]]. QVGA mode describes the size of an image in pixels, commonly called the resolution; numerous [[digital container format|video file format]]s support this resolution.\n\nWhile QVGA is a ''lower'' resolution than VGA, at higher resolutions the \"Q\" prefix commonly means ''quad(ruple)'' or four times ''higher'' display resolution (e.g., [[#QXGA (2048\u00d71536)|QXGA]] is four times higher resolution than [[#XGA (1024\u00d7768)|XGA]]). To distinguish ''quarter'' from ''quad'', lowercase \"q\" is sometimes used for \"quarter\" and uppercase \"Q\" for \"Quad\", by analogy with [[Metric prefix|SI prefix]]es like m/M and p/P, but this is not a consistent usage.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Accurate Power Estimation of LCD Panels for Notebook Design of Low-Cost 2.2-inch qVGA LTPS TFT-LCD Panel |first=Min-Seok |last=Shin |first2=Jung-Whan |last2=Choi |first3=Yong-Jae |last3=Kim |first4=Kyong-Rok |last4=Kim |first5=Inhwan |last5=Lee |first6=Oh-Kyong |last6=Kwon |journal=SID 2007 Digest |volume=38 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=260\u2013263}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of devices that use QVGA display resolution include, [[Samsung i5500]], [[LG Optimus L3]]-E400, [[Samsung Galaxy Fit|Galaxy Fit]], [[Samsung Galaxy Y|Y]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Pocket|Pocket]], [[HTC Wildfire]], [[Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini]] and [[Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini|mini pro]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]' bottom screen.\n\n{{anchor|WQVGA|WQVGA (400x240)|WQVGA (400\u00d7240)}}\n=== {{resx|400|240}} (WQVGA) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of WQVGA\n!

This definition is consistent with other 'wide' versions of computer displays.\n\nSince QVGA is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high (aspect ratio of 4:3), the resolution of a WQVGA screen might be {{resx|360|240}} (3:2 aspect ratio), {{resx|384|240}} (16:10 aspect ratio), {{resx|400|240}} (5:3 \u2013 such as the [[Nintendo 3DS]] screen or the maximum resolution in [[YouTube]] at 240p), {{resx|428|240}} (\u224816:9 ratio) or {{resx|432|240}} (18:10 aspect ratio). As with [[#WVGA (800\u00d7480)|WVGA]], exact ratios of ''n'':9 are difficult because of the way VGA controllers internally deal with pixels. For instance, when using graphical combinatorial operations on pixels, VGA controllers will use 1 bit per pixel. Since bits cannot be accessed individually but by chunks of 16 or an even higher power of 2, this limits the horizontal resolution to a 16-pixel granularity, i.e., the horizontal resolution must be divisible by 16. In the case of 16:9 ratio, with 240 pixels high, the horizontal resolution should be 240 / 9 \u00d7 16 = 426.{{overline|6}}, the closest multiple of 16 is 432.\n\nWQVGA has also been used to describe displays that are not 240 pixels high, for example [[Sixteenth HD1080]] displays which are 480 pixels wide and 270 or 272 pixels high. This may be due to WQVGA having the nearest screen height.\n\nWQVGA resolutions were commonly used in [[touchscreen]] mobile phones, such as {{resx|400|240}}, {{resx|432|240}}, and {{resx|480|240}}. For example, the [[Hyundai MB 490i]], Sony Ericsson Aino and the Samsung Instinct have WQVGA screen resolutions \u2013 {{resx|240|432}}. Other devices such as the Apple [[iPod Nano]] also use a WQVGA screen, {{resx|240|376}} pixels.\n\n{{anchor|HVGA|HVGA (480x320)|HVGA (480\u00d7320)}}\n=== {{resx|480|320}} (HVGA) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of HVGA\n!

Unlike VGA \u2013 a purely IBM-defined standard \u2013 Super VGA was defined by the [[Video Electronics Standards Association]] (VESA), an open consortium set up to promote interoperability and define standards. When used as a resolution specification, in contrast to [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] or [[#XGA (1024\u00d7768)|XGA]] for example, the term ''SVGA'' normally refers to a resolution of {{resx|800|600}} pixels.\n\nThe marginally higher resolution {{resx|832|624}} is the highest 4:3 resolution not greater than 2<sup>19</sup> pixels, with its horizontal dimension a multiple of 32 pixels. This enables it to fit within a [[framebuffer]] of 512{{nbsp}}[[Kilobyte|KB]] (512 \u00d7 2{{sup|10}} bytes), and the common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to [[Data structure alignment|alignment]].

Later it became the most common appellation of the {{resx|1024|768}} pixels [[display resolution]], but the official definition is broader than that. It was not a new and improved replacement for [[Super VGA]], but rather became one particular subset of the broad range of capabilities covered under the \"Super VGA\" umbrella.\n\nThe initial version of XGA (and its predecessor, the [[IBM 8514|IBM 8514/A]]) expanded upon IBM's older [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] by adding support for four new screen modes (three, for the 8514/A), including one new resolution:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-xga-graphics-chip |last=Necasek |first=Michal |title=The XGA Graphics Chip |work=The OS/2 Museum |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref>\n* {{resx|640|480}} pixels in direct 16 bits-per-pixel (65,536 color) RGB [[highcolor|hi-color]] (XGA only, with 1{{nbsp}}MB [[VRAM|video memory]] option) and 8 bpp (256 color) [[Palette (computing)|palette]]-indexed mode.\n* {{resx|1024|768}} pixels with a 16- or 256-color (4 or 8 bpp) [[Palette (computing)|palette]], using a low frequency [[interlaced]] refresh rate (again, the higher 8 bpp mode required 1{{nbsp}}MB VRAM<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-8514a-graphics-accelerator |last=Necasek |first=Michal |title=The 8514/A Graphics Accelerators |work=The OS/2 Museum |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref>).\n\nLike the 8514, XGA offered '''fixed function''' [[hardware acceleration]] to offload processing of 2D drawing tasks. Both adapters allowed offloading of line-draw, bitmap-copy ([[bitblt]]), and color-fill operations from the host [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. XGA's acceleration was faster than 8514's, and more comprehensive, supporting more drawing primitives, the VGA-res hi-color mode, versatile \"brush\" and \"mask\" modes, system memory addressing functions, and a single simple hardware sprite typically used to providing a low CPU load mouse pointer. It was also capable of wholly independent function, as it incorporated support for all existing VGA functions and modes \u2013 the 8514 itself was a simpler add-on adapter that required a separate VGA to be present. As they were designed for use with IBM's own range of fixed-frequency monitors, neither adapter offered support for {{resx|800|600}} [[SVGA]] modes.\n\n'''XGA-2''' added a 24-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]], but this was used only to extend the available master palette in 256-color mode, e.g. to allow true 256-greyscale output instead of the 64 grey levels previously available; there was still no direct [[24-bit color|True Color]] mode despite the adapter featuring enough default onboard VRAM (1{{nbsp}}MB) to support it. Other improvements included provision of the previously missing {{resx|800|600}} resolution (using an SVGA or multisync monitor) in up to 65,536 colors, faster screen refresh rates in all modes (including non-interlace, flicker-free output for {{resx|1024|768}}), and improved accelerator performance and versatility.\n\nIBM licensed the XGA technology and architecture to certain third party hardware developers, and its characteristic modes (although not necessarily the accelerator functions, nor the MCA data-bus interface) were aped by many others. These accelerators typically did not suffer from the same limitations on available resolutions and refresh rate, and featured other now-standard modes like {{resx|800|600}} (and {{resx|1280|1024}}) at various color depths (up to 24 bpp Truecolor) and interlaced, non-interlaced and flicker-free refresh rates even before the release of the XGA-2.\n\nAll standard XGA modes have a [[4:3]] [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] with square pixels, although this does not hold for certain standard VGA and third-party extended modes ({{resx|640|400}}, {{resx|1280|1024}}).\n\nXGA should not be confused with '''EVGA''' ([[Extended Video Graphics Array]]), a contemporaneous [[VESA]] standard that also has {{resx|1024|768}} pixels. It should also not be confused with the '''''Expanded''''' '''Graphics Adapter''', a peripheral for the [[IBM 3270 PC]] which can also be referred to as XGA.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=IBM 3270 Workstation Program User's Guide and Reference |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/pc/3270_PC/84X0982_3270_Workstation_Program_V1.0_Users_Guide_and_Reference_Apr87.pdf |page=GL-17 |publisher=International Business Machines Corporation |date=1987 |accessdate=2014-01-23 }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|WXGA_.281366x768_and_similar.29|WXGA|WXGA (1366x768 and similar)|WXGA (1366\u00d7768 and similar)}}\n\n=== {{resx|1366|768}} and similar (WXGA) ===\n\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of WXGA\n!

WXGA is commonly used for low-end [[LCD TV]]s and LCD [[computer monitor]]s for widescreen presentation. The exact resolution offered by a device described as \"WXGA\" can be somewhat variable owing to a proliferation of several closely related timings optimised for different uses and derived from different bases.\n\n{{anchor|1366x768|1366\u00d7768 (also known as WXGA)}}\n==== {{resx|1366|768}} ====\nWhen referring to televisions and other monitors intended for consumer entertainment use, WXGA is generally understood to refer to a resolution of {{resx|1366|768}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitachi.ca/supportingdocs/en/forhome/plasma_tvs/plasma_chart_full.pdf |title=Plasma TVs |publisher=Hitachi |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009123010/http://www.hitachi.ca/supportingdocs/en/forhome/plasma_tvs/plasma_chart_full.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> with an aspect ratio of very nearly 16:9. The basis for this otherwise odd seeming resolution is similar to that of other \"wide\" standards \u2013 the line scan (refresh) rate of the well-established \"XGA\" standard ({{resx|1024|768}} pixels, 4:3 aspect) extended to give square pixels on the increasingly popular 16:9 widescreen display ratio without having to effect major signalling changes other than a faster pixel clock, or manufacturing changes other than extending panel width by one third. As 768 does not divide exactly into 9, the aspect ratio is not ''quite'' 16:9 \u2013 this would require a horizontal width of 1365{{1/3}} pixels. However, at only 0.05%, the resulting error is insignificant.\n\nIn 2006, {{resx|1366|768}} was the most popular resolution for [[liquid crystal display television]]s (versus XGA for [[Plasma display|Plasma]] TVs [[flat panel display]]s);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/Public/Panel%20Standards/TVpnlV1.pdf |title=TV Panels Standard |publisher=VESA |format=PDF |date=10 March 2006 |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209101345/http://www.vesa.org/Public/Panel%20Standards/TVpnlV1.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} by 2013, even this was relegated to only being used in smaller or cheaper displays (e.g. \"bedroom\" LCD TVs, or low-cost, large-format plasmas), cheaper laptop and mobile tablet computers, and midrange home cinema projectors, having otherwise been overtaken by higher \"full HD\" resolutions such as {{resx|1920|1080}}.\n\n{{anchor|1360x768|1360\u00d7768}}\n==== {{resx|1360|768}} ====\nA common variant on this resolution is {{resx|1360|768}}, which confers several technical benefits, most significantly a reduction in memory requirements from just over to just under 1{{nbsp}}MB per 8-bit channel ({{resx|1366|768}} needs 1024.5{{nbsp}}KB per channel; {{resx|1360|768}} needs 1020{{nbsp}}KB; 1{{nbsp}}MB is equal to 1024{{nbsp}}KB), which simplifies architecture and can significantly reduce the amount\u2013and speed\u2013of VRAM required with only a very minor change in available resolution, as memory chips are usually only available in fixed megabyte capacities. For example, at 32-bit color, a {{resx|1360|768}} framebuffer would require only 4{{nbsp}}MB, whilst a {{resx|1366|768}} one may need 5, 6 or even 8{{nbsp}}MB depending on the exact display circuitry architecture and available chip capacities. The 6-pixel reduction also means each line's width is divisible by 8 pixels, simplifying numerous routines used in both computer and broadcast/theatrical video processing, which operate on 8-pixel blocks. Historically, many video cards also mandated screen widths divisible by 8 for their lower-color, planar modes to accelerate memory accesses and simplify pixel position calculations (e.g. fetching 4-bit pixels from 32-bit memory is much faster when performed 8 pixels at a time, and calculating exactly where a particular pixel is within a memory block is much easier when lines do not end partway through a memory word), and this convention still persisted in low-end hardware even into the early days of widescreen, LCD HDTVs; thus, most 1366-width displays also quietly support display of 1360-width material, with a thin border of unused pixel columns at each side. This narrower mode is of course even further removed from the 16:9 ideal, but the error is still less than 0.5% (technically, the mode is either 15.94:9.00 or 16.00:9.04) and should be imperceptible.\n\n{{anchor|1280x800|1280\u00d7800}}\n==== {{resx|1280|800}} ====\nWhen referring to laptop displays or independent displays and projectors intended primarily for use with computers, WXGA is also used to describe a resolution of {{resx|1280|800}} pixels, with an aspect ratio of [[16:10]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/press/AsiaTourOct05.pdf |title=VESA Asia Briefings |publisher=VESA |date=October 2005 |format=PDF |page=21 |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215105033/http://www.vesa.org/press/AsiaTourOct05.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dell.com/content/learnmore/learnmore.aspx?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd&~id=screen&~line=notebooks&~mode=popup&~model=d800&~series=latit&ref=CFG |title=LEARN MORE LCD Displays |publisher=Dell |accessdate=2013-05-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/merchandising/us/specialoffers/popups/help_me_decide/popup_helpme_display.html |title=Help Me Decide |publisher=Lenovo |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192233/http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/merchandising/us/specialoffers/popups/help_me_decide/popup_helpme_display.html |archivedate=2014-01-02}}</ref> This was once particularly popular for laptop screens, usually with a diagonal screen size of between 12 and 15 inches, as it provided a useful compromise between 4:3 XGA and 16:9 WXGA, with improved resolution in ''both'' dimensions vs. the old standard (especially useful in portrait mode, or for displaying two standard pages of text side by side), a perceptibly \"wider\" appearance and the ability to display 720p HD video \"native\" with only very thin letterbox borders (usable for on-screen playback controls) and no stretching. Additionally, like {{resx|1360|768}}, it required only 1000{{nbsp}}KB (just under 1{{nbsp}}MB) of memory per 8-bit channel; thus, a typical double-buffered 32-bit colour screen could fit within 8{{nbsp}}MB, limiting everyday demands on the complexity (and cost, energy use) of integrated graphics chipsets and their shared use of typically sparse system memory (generally allocated to the video system in relatively large blocks), at least when only the internal display was in use (external monitors generally being supported in \"extended desktop\" mode to at least {{resx|1600|1200}} resolution). 16:10 (or 8:5) is itself a rather \"classic\" computer aspect ratio, harking back all the way to early {{resx|320|200}} modes (and their derivatives) as seen in the Commodore 64, IBM CGA card and others. However, as of mid 2013, this standard is becoming increasingly rare, crowded out by the more standardised and thus more economical-to-produce {{resx|1366|768}} panels, as its previously beneficial features become less important with improvements to hardware, gradual loss of general backwards software compatibility, and changes in interface layout. As of August 2013, the market availability of panels with {{resx|1280|800}} native resolution had been generally relegated to data projectors or niche products such as convertible tablet PCs and LCD-based eBook readers.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}\n\n{{anchor|WXGA_HD|1280x768}}\n==== Others ====\nAdditionally, at least two other resolutions are sometimes labelled as WXGA:\n\n* First, the [[HDTV]]-standard {{resx|1280|720}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=22206&vpn=EY.J4401.007&manufacture=Acer |title=Acer PH530 HDTV DLP Projector |publisher=NCIX |accessdate=2013-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429023140/http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=22206&vpn=EY.J4401.007&manufacture=Acer |archivedate=2012-04-29}}</ref> (otherwise commonly described as \"[[720p]]\"), which offers an exact 16:9 aspect with square pixels; naturally, it displays standard 720p HD video material without stretching or letterboxing and 1080i/1080p with a simple 2:3 downscale. This resolution has found some use in tablets and modern, high-pixel-density mobile phones, as well as small-format \"netbook\" or \"ultralight\" laptop computers. However, its use is uncommon in larger, mainstream devices as it has insufficient vertical resolution for the proper use of modern operating systems such as Windows 7 whose UI design assumes a minimum of 768 lines. For certain uses such as word processing, it can even be considered a slight downgrade (reducing number of simultaneously visible lines of text without granting any significant benefit as even 640 pixels is sufficient horizontal resolution to legibly render a full page width, especially with the addition of subpixel anti-aliasing).\n* The second variant, {{resx|1280|768}}, can be seen as a compromise resolution that addressed this problem, as well as a halfway point between the older {{resx|1024|768}} and {{resx|1280|1024}} resolutions, and a stepping stone to {{resx|1366|768}} (being one-quarter wider than 1024, not one-third) and {{resx|1280|800}}, that never quite caught on in the same way as either of its arguably derivative successors. Its square-pixel aspect ratio is 15:9, in contrast to HDTV's 16:9 and {{resx|1280|800}}'s 16:10. It is also the lowest resolution that might be found in an \"Ultrabook\" standard laptop, as it satisfies the minimum horizontal and vertical pixel resolutions required to officially qualify for the designation.\n* Other mentionable resolutions are {{resx|1152|768}} with 3:2 aspect ratio, and {{resx|1344|768}} with 7:4 aspect ratio (similar to 16:9).\nWidespread availability of {{resx|1280|800}} and {{resx|1366|768}} pixel resolution LCDs for laptop monitors can be considered an [[operating system|OS]]-driven evolution from the formerly popular {{resx|1024|768}} screen size, which has itself since seen UI design feedback in response to what could be considered disadvantages of the widescreen format when used with programs designed for \"traditional\" screens. In [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] specifically, the larger [[task bar]] of Windows Vista and 7 occupies an additional 16 pixel lines by default, which may compromise the usability of programs that already demanded a full {{resx|1024|768}} (instead of, e.g. {{resx|800|600}}) unless it is specifically set to use small icons; an \"oddball\" 784-line resolution would compensate for this, but {{resx|1280|800}} has a simpler aspect and also gives the slight bonus of 16 ''more'' usable lines. Also, the [[Windows Sidebar]] in [[Windows Vista]] and 7 can use the additional 256 or 336 horizontal pixels to display informational \"widgets\" without compromising the display width of other programs, and Windows 8 is specifically designed around a \"two pane\" concept where the full 16:9 or 16:10 screen is not required. Typically, this consists of a 4:3 main program area (typically {{resx|1024|768}}, {{resx|1000|800}} or {{resx|1440|1080}}) plus a narrow sidebar running a second program, showing a toolbox for the main program or a pop-out OS shortcut panel taking up the remainder.\n* Some {{resx|1440|900}} resolution displays have also been found labeled as WXGA; however, the correct label is actually [[#WXGA+ (1440\u00d7900)|WSXGA or WXGA+]].\n\n{{anchor|XGAplus|XGA+ (1152x864)|XGA+ (1152\u00d7864)|megapixel}}\n\n=== {{resx|1152|864}} (XGA+) ===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|+ Variants of XGA+\n!

Until the advent of widescreen [[LCD]]s, XGA+ was often used on 17-inch desktop [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. It is the highest 4:3 resolution not greater than 2{{sup|20}} pixels (\u22481.05{{nbsp}}[[megapixel]]s), with its horizontal dimension a multiple of 32 pixels. This enables it to fit closely into a video memory or framebuffer of 1{{nbsp}}[[Megabyte|MB]] (1 \u00d7 2{{sup|20}} [[byte]]s), assuming the use of one byte per pixel. The common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to [[Data structure alignment|alignment]].\n\nHistorically, the resolution also relates to the earlier standard of {{resx|1152|900}} pixels, which was adopted by [[Sun Microsystems]] for the [[Sun-2]] [[workstation]] in the early 1980s. A decade later, [[Apple Computer]] selected the resolution of {{resx|1152|870}} for their 21-inch CRT monitors, intended for use as two-page displays on the [[Macintosh II]] computer. These resolutions are even closer to the limit of a 1{{nbsp}}MB framebuffer, but their aspect ratios differ slightly from the common 4:3.\n\nXGA+ is the next step after [[#XGA|XGA]] ({{resx|1024|768}}), although it is not approved by any standard organizations. The next step with an aspect ratio of 4:3 is {{resx|1280|960}} (\"[[#SXGAminus|SXGA-]]\") or [[#SXGAplus|SXGA+]] ({{resx|1400|1050}}).\n\n{{anchor|WXGAplus|WSXGA|WXGA+ (1440x900)|WXGA+ (1440\u00d7900)}}\n=== {{resx|1440|900}} (WXGA+, WSXGA) ===\n'''WXGA+''' and '''WSXGA''' are non-standard terms referring to a computer display resolution of {{resx|1440|900}}.

The aspect ratios of each are [[16:10]] ([[widescreen]]).\n\nWXGA+ ({{resx|1440|900}}) resolution is common in 19-inch widescreen desktop monitors (a very small number of such monitors use [[#WSXGA+ (1680\u00d71050)|WSXGA+]]), and is also optional, although less common, in [[laptop]] LCDs, in sizes ranging from 12.1 to 17 inches.\n\nAnother resolution going by this name is {{resx|1440|960}}, at an aspect ratio of 15:10 ([[widescreen]]).\n\n{{anchor|SXGA|SXGAminus|SXGA (1280x1024)|SXGA (1280\u00d71024)}}\n=== {{resx|1280|1024}} (SXGA) ===\n'''Super Extended Graphics Array''' ('''SXGA''') is a standard monitor resolution of {{resx|1280|1024}} pixels. This [[display resolution]] is the \"next step\" above the XGA resolution that [[IBM]] developed in 1990.\n\nThe {{resx|1280|1024}} resolution is not the standard 4:3 aspect ratio, but 5:4 (1.25:1 instead of 1.333:1). A standard 4:3 monitor using this resolution will have rectangular rather than square pixels, meaning that unless the software compensates for this the picture will be distorted, causing circles to appear elliptical.\n\nThere is a less common {{resx|1280|960}} resolution that preserves the common 4:3 aspect ratio. It is sometimes unofficially called '''SXGA\u2212''' to avoid confusion with the \"standard\" SXGA. Elsewhere this 4:3 resolution was also called '''UVGA''' (''Ultra VGA''): Since both sides are doubled from VGA the term ''Quad VGA'' would be a systematic one, but it is hardly ever used, because its initialism [[#QVGA|QVGA]] is strongly associated with the alternate meaning ''Quarter VGA'' ({{resx|320|240}}).\n\nSXGA is the most common native resolution of 17 inch and 19 inch [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors. An LCD monitor with SXGA native resolution will typically have a physical 5:4 aspect ratio, preserving a 1:1 [[pixel aspect ratio]].\n\n[[Sony]] manufactured a 17-inch [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor with a 5:4 aspect ratio designed for this resolution. It was sold under the Apple brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nSXGA is also a popular resolution for cell phone cameras, such as the Motorola Razr and most Samsung and LG phones. Although being taken over by newer UXGA (2.0-megapixel) cameras, the 1.3-megapixel was the most common around 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAny CRT that can run {{resx|1280|1024}} can also run {{resx|1280|960}}, which has the standard 4:3 ratio. A flat panel [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|TFT]] screen, including one designed for {{resx|1280|1024}}, will show stretching distortion when set to display any resolution other than its native one, as the image needs to be interpolated to fit in the fixed grid display. Some TFT displays do not allow a user to disable this, and will prevent the upper and lower portions of the screen from being used forcing a \"[[Letterboxing (filming)|letterbox]]\" format when set to a 4:3 ratio.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe {{resx|1280|1024}} resolution became popular because at [[24-bit color|24{{nbsp}}bit/px color depth]] it fit well into 4 [[megabyte]]s of [[video RAM]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} At the time, memory was extremely expensive. Using {{resx|1280|1024}} at 24-bit color depth allowed using 3.75{{nbsp}}[[Megabyte|MB]] of video RAM, fitting nicely with [[VRAM]] chip sizes which were available at the time (4{{nbsp}}MB):\n: ({{resx|1280|1024}}) px \u00d7 24{{nbsp}}bit/px \u00f7 8{{nbsp}}bit/byte \u00f7 2<sup>20</sup>{{nbsp}}byte/MB = 3.75{{nbsp}}MB\n\n{{anchor|SXGAplus|SXGA+ (1400x1050)|SXGA+ (1400\u00d71050)}}\n=== {{resx|1400|1050}} (SXGA+) ===\n'''SXGA+''' stands for '''Super Extended Graphics Array Plus''' and is a [[computer display standard]]. An SXGA+ display is commonly used on 14-inch or 15-inch [[laptop]] [[LCD]] screens with a [[display resolution|resolution]] of {{resx|1400|1050}} pixels. An SXGA+ display is used on a few 12-inch laptop screens such as the [[ThinkPad]] X60 and X61 (both only as tablet) as well as the [[Toshiba]] Port\u00e9g\u00e9 M200 and M400, but those are far less common. At 14.1 inches, [[Dell]] offered SXGA+ on many of the Dell Latitude \"C\" series laptops, such as the C640, and IBM since the [[ThinkPad]] T21 . [[Sony]] also used SXGA+ in their Z1 series, but no longer produce them as widescreen has become more predominant.\n\nIn desktop LCDs, SXGA+ is used on some low-end 20-inch monitors, whereas most of the 20-inch LCDs use UXGA (standard screen ratio), or WSXGA+ (widescreen ratio).\n\n{{anchor|WSXGA+ (1050p)|WSXGAplus|WSXGA+ (1680x1050)|WSXGA+ (1680\u00d71050)}}\n=== {{resx|1680|1050}} (WSXGA+) ===\n'''WSXGA+''' stands for '''Widescreen Super Extended Graphics Array Plus'''. WSXGA+ displays were commonly used on Widescreen 20-, 21-, and 22-inch LCD monitors from numerous manufacturers (and a very small number of 19-inch widescreen monitors), as well as widescreen 15.4-inch and 17-inch [[laptop]] [[LCD]] screens like the [[Thinkpad]] T61p, the late 17\" Apple [[PowerBook G4]] and the unibody Apple 15\" [[MacBook Pro]]. The [[display resolution|resolution]] is {{resx|1680|1050}} pixels (1,764,000 pixels) with a 16:10 aspect ratio.\n\nWSXGA+ is the widescreen version of [[SXGA+]], but it is not approved by any organization.

[[Dell]] Inc. refers to the same resolution of 1,920,000 pixels as ''UGA''. It is generally considered to be the next step above [[#SXGA (1280\u00d71024)|SXGA]] ({{resx|1280|960}} or {{resx|1280|1024}}), but some resolutions (such as the unnamed {{resx|1366|1024}} and [[#SXGA+ (1400\u00d71050)|SXGA+]] at {{resx|1400|1050}}) fit between the two.\n\nUXGA has been the native resolution of many fullscreen monitors of 15 inches or more, including laptop LCDs such as the ones in [[ThinkPad]] A21p, A30p, A31p, T42p, T43p, T60p, Dell Inspiron 8000/8100/8200 and Latitude/Precision equivalents; Panasonic Toughbook CF-51; and the original Alienware Area 51m. However, in more recent times, UXGA is not used in laptops at all but rather in desktop UXGA monitors that have been made in sizes of 20 inches and 21.3 inches. Some 14-inch laptop LCDs with UXGA have also existed, but these were very rare.\n\nThere are two different widescreen cousins of UXGA, one called UWXGA with {{resx|1600|768}} (750) and one called [[#WUXGA (1920\u00d71200)|WUXGA]] with {{resx|1920|1200}} resolution.\n\n{{anchor|WUXGA|WUXGA (1920x1200)|WUXGA (1920\u00d71200)}}\n=== {{resx|1920|1200}} (WUXGA) ===\n'''WUXGA''' stands for '''Widescreen Ultra Extended Graphics Array''' and is a [[display resolution]] of {{resx|1920|1200}} pixels (2,304,000 pixels) with a 16:10 screen aspect ratio.

Some examples of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors that have pixel counts at these levels are the Dell 3008WFP, the [[Apple Cinema Display]], the Apple [[iMac]] (27-inch 2009\u2013present), the [[iPad (3rd generation)]], and the [[MacBook Pro]] (3rd generation). Many standard 21\u201322-inch CRT monitors and some of the highest-end 19-inch CRTs also support this resolution.\n\n{{anchor|QWXGA|QWXGA (2048x1152)|QWXGA (2048\u00d71152)}}\n=== {{resx|2048|1152}} (QWXGA) ===\n{{distinguish|text=WQXGA}}\n\n'''QWXGA''' ('''Quad Wide Extended Graphics Array''') is a [[display resolution]] of {{resx|2048|1152}} pixels with a [[16:9]] aspect ratio. A few QWXGA LCD monitors were available in 2009 with 23- and 27-inch displays, such as the [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] B233HU (23-inch) and B273HU (27-inch), the [[Dell]] SP2309W, and the [[Samsung]] 2343BWX. As of 2011, most {{resx|2048|1152}} monitors have been discontinued, and as of 2013 no major manufacturer produces monitors with this resolution.\n\n{{anchor|QXGA|QXGA (2048x1536)|QXGA (2048\u00d71536)}}\n=== {{resx|2048|1536}} (QXGA) ===\n'''QXGA''' ('''Quad Extended Graphics Array''') is a [[display resolution]] of {{resx|2048|1536}} pixels with a [[4:3]] aspect ratio. The name comes from it having four times as many pixels as an XGA display. Examples of LCDs with this resolution are the [[IBM]] T210 and the [[Eizo]] G33 and R31 screens, but in CRT monitors this resolution is much more common; some examples include the [[Sony]] F520, [[ViewSonic]] G225fB, [[NEC]] FP2141SB or [[Mitsubishi]] DP2070SB, [[Iiyama (company)|Iiyama]] Vision Master Pro 514, and [[Dell]] and [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] P1230. Of these monitors, none are still in production. A related display size is [[#WQXGA (2560\u00d71600)|WQXGA]], which is a [[wide screen]] version. CRTs offer a way to achieve QXGA cheaply. Models like the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2045U and IBM ThinkVision C220P retailed for around US$200, and even higher performance ones like the ViewSonic PerfectFlat P220fB remained under $500. At one time, many off-lease P1230s could be found on eBay for under $150. The LCDs with WQXGA or QXGA resolution typically cost four to five times more for the same resolution. [[International Display Technology|IDTech]] manufactured a 15-inch QXGA [[E-IPS|IPS]] panel, used in the IBM [[ThinkPad]] R50p. NEC sold laptops with QXGA screens in 2002\u201305 for the Japanese market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/ja/0207/0101.html |publisher=NEC |script-title=ja:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |date=1 July 2002 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/ja/0501/1901.html |publisher=NEC |script-title=ja:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |date=19 January 2005 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The [[iPad]] (starting from [[iPad (3rd generation)|3rd generation]]) also has a QXGA display.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17292424 |title=Apple unveils new iPad with high-definition screen |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|WQXGA|WQXGA (2560x1600)|WQXGA (2560\u00d71600)}}\n=== {{resx|2560|1600}} (WQXGA) ===\n{{distinguish|text=QWXGA}}\n\n'''WQXGA''' ('''Wide Quad Extended Graphics Array''') is a [[display resolution]] of {{resx|2560|1600}} pixels with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The name comes from it being a wide version of QXGA and having four times as many pixels as an [[#WXGA (1280\u00d7768)|WXGA]] ({{resx|1280|800}}) display.\n\nTo obtain a vertical refresh rate higher than 40{{nbsp}}Hz with [[DVI]], this resolution requires [[Dual-link DVI|dual-link]] DVI cables and devices. To avoid cable problems monitors are sometimes shipped with an appropriate dual link cable already plugged in. Many [[video cards]] support this resolution. One feature that is currently unique to the 30{{nbsp}}inch WQXGA monitors is the ability to function as the centerpiece and main display of a three-monitor array of complementary aspect ratios, with two [[#UXGA (1600\u00d71200)|UXGA]] ({{resx|1600|1200}}) 20-inch monitors turned vertically on either side. The resolutions are equal, and the size of the 1600 resolution edges (if the manufacturer is honest) is within a tenth of an inch (16-inch vs. 15.899<small>99</small>\"), presenting a \"picture window view\" without the extreme lateral dimensions, small central panel, asymmetry, resolution differences, or dimensional difference of other three-monitor combinations. The resulting {{resx|4960|1600}} composite image has a 3.1:1 aspect ratio. This also means one UXGA 20-inch monitor in portrait orientation can also be flanked by two 30-inch WQXGA monitors for a {{resx|6320|1600}} composite image with an 11.85:3 (79:20, 3.95:1) aspect ratio. Some WQXGA medical displays (such as the Barco Coronis 4MP) can also be configured as two virtual {{resx|1200|1600}} or {{resx|1280|1600}} seamless displays by using both DVI ports at the same time.\n\nAn early consumer WQXGA monitor was the 30-inch Apple Cinema Display, unveiled by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in June 2004. At the time, dual-link DVI was uncommon on consumer hardware, so Apple partnered with [[Nvidia]] to develop a special graphics card that had two dual-link DVI ports, allowing simultaneous use of two 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays. The nature of this graphics card, being an add-in AGP card, meant that the monitors could only be used in a desktop computer, like the Power Mac G5, that could have the add-in card installed, and could not be immediately used with laptop computers that lacked this expansion capability.\n\nIn 2010, WQXGA made its debut in a handful of home theater projectors targeted at the Constant Height Screen application market. Both Digital Projection Inc and projectiondesign released models based on a [[Texas Instruments]] DLP chip with a native WQXGA resolution, alleviating the need for an anamorphic lens to achieve 1:2.35 image projection. Many manufacturers have 27\u201330-inch models that are capable of WQXGA, albeit at a much higher price than lower resolution monitors of the same size. Several mainstream WQXGA monitors are or were available with 30-inch displays, such as the [[Dell monitors|Dell]] 3007WFP-HC, 3008WFP, U3011, U3014, UP3017, the [[Hewlett-Packard]] LP3065, the [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] XHD3000, [[LG]] W3000H, and the [[Samsung]] 305T. Specialist manufacturers like [[NEC]], [[Eizo]], [[Planar Systems]], [[Barco NV|Barco]] (LC-3001), and possibly others offer similar models. As of 2016, [[LG Display]] make a 10-bit 30-inch AH-IPS panel, with wide color gamut, used in monitors from Dell, NEC, HP, Lenovo and Iiyama.\n\nReleased in November 2012, Google's [[Nexus 10]] is the first consumer [[tablet computer|tablet]] to feature WQXGA resolution. Before its release, the highest resolution available on a tablet was QXGA ({{resx|2048|1536}}), available on the Apple [[iPad]] 3rd and 4th generations devices. Several Samsung Galaxy tablets, including the Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), Tab S 8.4, 10.5 and TabPRO 8.4, 10.1 and Note Pro 12.2, as well as the Gigaset QV1030, also feature a WQXGA resolution display.\n\nIn 2012, Apple released the 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display that features a WQXGA display, and the new MacBook Air in 2018.\n\n{{anchor|QSXGA|QSXGA (2560x2048)|QSXGA (2560\u00d72048)}}\n=== {{resx|2560|2048}} (QSXGA) ===\n'''QSXGA''' ('''Quad Super Extended Graphics Array''') is a display resolution of {{resx|2560|2048}} pixels with a 5:4 aspect ratio. Grayscale monitors with a {{resx|2560|2048}} resolution, primarily for medical use, are available from [[Planar Systems]] (Dome E5), [[Eizo]] (Radiforce G51), [[Barco NV|Barco]] (Nio 5, MP), [[Wide-angle Infinity Display Equipment|WIDE]] (IF2105MP), [[International Display Technology|IDTech]] (IAQS80F), and possibly others.\n\nRecent medical displays such as Barco Coronis Fusion 10MP or NDS Dome S10 have native panel resolution of {{resx|4096|2560}}. These are driven by two dual-link DVI or [[DisplayPort]] outputs. They can be considered to be two seamless virtual QSXGA displays as they have to be driven simultaneously by both dual link DVI or DisplayPort since one dual link DVI or DisplayPort cannot single-handedly display 10 megapixels. A similar resolution of {{resx|2560|1920}} (4:3) was supported by a small number of CRT displays via VGA such as the Viewsonic P225f when paired with the right graphics card.\n\n{{anchor|WQSXGA|WQSXGA (3200x2048)|WQSXGA (3200\u00d72048)}}\n=== {{resx|3200|2048}} (WQSXGA) ===\n'''WQSXGA''' ('''Wide Quad Super Extended Graphics Array''') describes a display standard that can support a resolution up to {{resx|3200|2048}} pixels, assuming a 1.5625:1 (25:16) aspect ratio.

This resolution is exactly four times {{resx|1920|1200}} (in pixels).\n\nMost [[Graphics card|display cards]] with a DVI connector are capable of supporting the {{resx|3840|2400}} resolution. However, the maximum refresh rate will be limited by the number of DVI links which are connected to the monitor. 1, 2, or 4 DVI connectors are used to drive the monitor using various tile configurations. Only the IBM T221-DG5 and IDTech MD22292B5 support the use of dual-link DVI ports through an external converter box. Many systems using these monitors use at least two DVI connectors to send video to the monitor. These DVI connectors can be from the same graphics card, different graphics cards, or even different computers. Motion across the tile boundary(ies) can show [[screen tearing|tearing]] if the DVI links are not synchronized.

The [[iPhone X]] introduced a 2436 \u00d7 1125 resolution (with a notch) at an aspect ratio of roughly 13:6 or, for marketing, 19.5:9.\n\nOther manufacturers have also introduced phones with irregular display resolutions and aspect ratios, e.g. Samsung's various ''Infinity'' displays with 37:18 = {{sfrac|18|1|2}}:9 ([[Samsung Galaxy S8|Galaxy S8]]/[[Samsung Galaxy S9|S9]] and [[Samsung Galaxy A8|A8]]/[[Samsung Galaxy A9|A9]]), i.e. 2960 \u00d7 1440 (Quad HD+, WQHD+) or 2220 \u00d7 1080 (Full HD+), and 19:9 ([[Samsung Galaxy S10|S10]]) aspect ratios: 3040 \u00d7 1440 and 2280 \u00d7 1080 (S10e).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of common resolutions]]\n* [[Ultrawide formats]] for history and comparison of video formats and displays, which are growing wider\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Computer display standard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphic Display Resolutions}}\n[[Category:Computer display standards]]\n", "name_user": "RahulPatel72", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}

It is situated in the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] (since 1999); previously it was in [[Olsztyn Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998). It is the capital of [[I\u0142awa County]].\n\nThe town is located in the I\u0142awskie Lake District, on the longest lake in Poland - [[Jeziorak]].<ref name=\"jeziorak\">[http://www.podomega.pl/index.php/sklep/item/184-jeziorak-najd%C5%82u%C5%BCsze-jezioro-w-polsce. Jeziorak najd\u0142u\u017csze Jezioro w Polsce].</ref> It is located in the area of historical [[Bishopric of Pomesania|Pomesania]] in the area defined as [[Upper Prussia]] ger. Oberland in Germany since the 16th century. The rivers I\u0142awka and Tynwa\u0142d flow through I\u0142awa. Within the city's administrative area there is the largest inland island in Poland - [[Wielka \u017bu\u0142awa]], which has a permanent ferry connection with the city. The city is located in the area of the [[Green Lungs of Poland]] - an area characterized by clean air and diversity of the natural system. From the west and north, I\u0142awa is surrounded by the [[I\u0142awa Lake District Landscape Park]]. I\u0142awa is a holiday, paralympic and tourist resort. In the forest just outside I\u0142awa there are two [[Telewizja Polska|Polish Television]] holiday resorts ([[Sarn\u00f3wka, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sarn\u00f3wek]] and [[T\u0142okowisko]])<ref name=\"tlokowisko\">[http://tlokowisko.obitur.pl/. T\u0142okowisko O\u015brodek Wypoczynkowy Telewizja Polska S.A. | Siemiany].</ref> to which journalists come for a holiday. From I\u0142awa you can reach the [[Baltic Sea]] through [[Jeziorak]] Lake and the historic, unique in the world [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]]. Before World War II, the town was called \"[[The Pearl of Oberland]]\";. At Lake [[Silm]], one of the world's several training centres for skippers and port pilots, they learn to manoeuvre seagoing ships on miniaturised models. The city is called the summer capital of traditional jazz because of the oldest festival of this music genre in Europe - [[Old Jazz Meeting \"Z\u0142ota Tarka\"]];. In I\u0142awa there is the Pope's Calvary of the I\u0142awa Lake District, whose canoe-shaped Stations of the Cross refer to and commemorate Karol Wojty\u0142a's two visits to Jeziorak, after which the future Pope was kayaking with young people. I\u0142awa lies on the [[Camino de Santiago|Road of St. James]] (one of the most important Christian pilgrimage routes in the world) which leads to the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Cathedral of Santiago de Compostella]] in Spain.\n\n== Natural conditions ==\nAccording to the data of January 1, 2009, the area of the city is 21. 88&nbsp;km\u00b2,<ref name=\"powierzchnia\">|https://web.archive.org/web/20131220071949/http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/5840_908_PLK_HTML.htm</ref> placing the city on the third position in the province. The town is also the fifth largest in the Warmia and Mazury region and the fifth in the population.\n\nI\u0142awa and its surroundings lie on undulating [[moraine]] and sandstone areas, distinguished by varied forms of sculpture. Within the city, on Lake Jeziorak (the longest lake in Poland and the sixth largest) is the island of [[Wielka \u017bu\u0142awa]] with relics of an Old Prussian town. In the vicinity of the city, in the sand terrain, there are lakes, mainly [[gutter lakes]], surrounded by significant forest complexes. In I\u0142awa itself, apart from the mentioned Jeziorak, there are a dozen or so smaller lakes(i.a. Little Jeziorak, I\u0142awskie, D\u00f3\u0142). The lakes and rivers of the I\u0142awskie Lake land form, together with the [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]], a widesystem of inland navigation, connecting the surrounding water bodies. This channel makes it possible to reach the Baltic Sea from I\u0142awa.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:I\u0142awa czerwony ko\u015bci\u00f3\u01422.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Church of the Transfiguration]]\nThe city existed originally as an Old Prussian settlement and was recorded by Teutonic Knights in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] in 1305. It is documented in a manuscript by [[Luther von Braunschweig]] in 1317 and its first names are known as Ylavia, Ylaw, and Ilow.<ref>Zabytkowe o\u015brodki miejskie Warmii i Mazur Lucjan Czubiel, Tadeusz Domaga\u0142a page 149 Pojezierze 1969</ref> It was located on the [[I\u0142awka|Eylenz (I\u0142awka)]] River between Lakes [[Jeziorak|Geserich (Jeziorak)]] and [[I\u0142awskie (lake)|Eylenz (I\u0142awskie)]]. The town was under the jurisdiction of the [[komtur]] of [[Dzierzgo\u0144|Christburg (Dzierzgo\u0144)]] and since 1340 under [[Ostr\u00f3da|Osterode (Ostr\u00f3da)]].\n\nAt the start of the [[Thirteen Years\u2019 War (1454\u20131466)]] in February 1454, I\u0142awa sided with the [[Prussian Confederation]], at the request of which King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland.<ref name=IL>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilawa.pl/page/163,Historia-i-legendy.html|title=Historia i legendy, Urz\u0105d Miasta I\u0142awy - serwis miejski|accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref> In April 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King. After Poland's loss at the [[Battle of Chojnice (1454)|Battle of Chojnice]], in November 1454 it was taken over by the Teutonic Knights,<ref name=IL/> who handed over its defence to [[Czechs|Czech]] mercenaries. In 1457, the unpaid Czech mercenaries sold the town to Poland. After the [[Second Peace of Toru\u0144|peace treaty]] signed in [[Toru\u0144]] in 1466 the town came under Polish suzerainty as a [[fief]].<ref name=IL/> In 1520 Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]] granted I\u0142awa the right to collect tolls on the bridge over Jeziorak.\n\nIn 1525 the town became part of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], a vassal state of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]],<ref name=IL/> and in 1701 it became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the new province of [[West Prussia]] in 1773, it became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. During the [[Seven Years' War]], the town was occupied by [[Russia]] between 1758 and 1762.\n\nIn 1862 the [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]] was built between [[Elbl\u0105g|Elbing (Elbl\u0105g)]] and Eylau by engineer [[Georg Steenke]], which enabled the inland town to transport bulk of lumber, farm products, and other goods north to Elbing and the [[Baltic Sea]]. This was superseded ten years later by rail transport, when the [[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]]-[[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg (Chernyakhovsk)]] railway line was constructed.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Jeziorak Ma\u0142y 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Town view from the [[Jeziorak|Jeziorak Lake]] in the early 20th century]]\nAfter Poland regained its independence in 1918, the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] of 1920 allowed the residents to cast votes either in favor of remaining in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] or becoming a part of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. The vote took place amid persecution of Polish activists by the German side.<ref>[http://www.obn.olsztyn.pl/towarzystwo/artykuly/bibkiografia.pdf BAZA ARTYKU\u0141\u00d3W DOTYCZ\u0104CYCH PLEBISCYTU NA WARMII, MAZURACH I POWI\u015aLU W 1920 ROKU] (PDF, 2.0&nbsp;MB)</ref> Ultimately the town voted to remain in Germany by 4,746 to 235 votes. It became part of [[Marienwerder (region)|Regierungsbezirk West Prussia]] in the [[Province of East Prussia]].\n\nTowards the end of the World War II, most population left the town, and the Soviet Army destroyed approcimately 85% of the town.<ref name=\"I\u0142awa, miasto z b\u0142ota\">[https://www.pojezierzeilawskie.pl/ilawa.html I\u0142awa, miasto z b\u0142ota]</ref> After World War II, Soviet pressure at the [[Potsdam Conference]] led to I\u0142awa inclusion in the Polish territory. The historic Polish name ''I\u0142awa'' was adopted to replace the Germanized name.\n\n== Toponyms ==\nThe name I\u0142awa is thought to originate from the ancient Prussian word ''ilis'', meaning black. The related Baltic-Slavic word ''ilo'' or ''ilu'' means the black colour but also mud. The name might refer to the swampy area where the city lies, or to the dark water of the lake Jeziorak.<ref name=\"I\u0142awa, miasto z b\u0142ota\"/>\n\nThe oldest written form of the name I\u0142awa is Latin Ylavia. This form appeared on a location document from 1317. Later documents of 1333 and 1334 mention Ylav, while the variety Ylau is mentioned in 1338. In the fifteenth century, the form Ylow and Ylow Thethonicalis appeared. In the years 1430 and 1438, the documents issued by the Dzierzgon command post spoke of Deutschen Ylaw. In the years 1443, 1457 and 1458 the town was named Ylau, and in 1456 it took the form of Ilau, then in 1459 it was changed to Eylaw. The name Deutze Eylau is used in 1457 and its other form Dwetsch Eylau in 1468. Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the names Teutschen Eylau, Deutscheneylau and Theuto Ilavia appear. In the 18th century, the Deutsch Eylau form was adopted, valid until 1933. On 1 January 1934 the name was changed to Stadt Deutsch Eylau (Stadt - en. The town), and since 1945 the Polish name of the town is I\u0142awa, which was officially approved on 7 May 1946.<ref name=\"zarz\">Zarz\u0105dzenie Ministr\u00f3w: Administracji Publicznej i Ziem Odzyskanych z dnia 7 maja 1946 r.

It is situated in the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] (since 1999); previously it was in [[Olsztyn Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998). It is the capital of [[I\u0142awa County]].\n\nThe town is located in the I\u0142awskie Lake District, on the longest lake in Poland - [[Jeziorak]].<ref name=\"jeziorak\">[http://www.podomega.pl/index.php/sklep/item/184-jeziorak-najd%C5%82u%C5%BCsze-jezioro-w-polsce. Jeziorak najd\u0142u\u017csze Jezioro w Polsce].</ref> It is located in the area of historical [[Bishopric of Pomesania|Pomesania]] in the area defined as [[Upper Prussia]] ger. Oberland in Germany since the 16th century. The rivers I\u0142awka and Tynwa\u0142d flow through I\u0142awa. Within the city's administrative area there is the largest inland island in Poland - [[Wielka \u017bu\u0142awa]], which has a permanent ferry connection with the city. The city is located in the area of the [[Green Lungs of Poland]] - an area characterized by clean air and diversity of the natural system. From the west and north, I\u0142awa is surrounded by the [[I\u0142awa Lake District Landscape Park]]. I\u0142awa is a holiday, paralympic and tourist resort. In the forest just outside I\u0142awa there are two [[Telewizja Polska|Polish Television]] holiday resorts ([[Sarn\u00f3wka, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sarn\u00f3wek]] and [[T\u0142okowisko]])<ref name=\"tlokowisko\">[http://tlokowisko.obitur.pl/. T\u0142okowisko O\u015brodek Wypoczynkowy Telewizja Polska S.A. | Siemiany].</ref> to which journalists come for a holiday. From I\u0142awa you can reach the [[Baltic Sea]] through [[Jeziorak]] Lake and the historic, unique in the world [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]]. Before World War II, the town was called \"[[The Pearl of Oberland]]\";. At Lake [[Silm]], one of the world's several training centres for skippers and port pilots, they learn to manoeuvre seagoing ships on miniaturised models. The city is called the summer capital of traditional jazz because of the oldest festival of this music genre in Europe - [[Old Jazz Meeting \"Z\u0142ota Tarka\"]];. In I\u0142awa there is the Pope's Calvary of the I\u0142awa Lake District, whose canoe-shaped Stations of the Cross refer to and commemorate Karol Wojty\u0142a's two visits to Jeziorak, after which the future Pope was kayaking with young people. I\u0142awa lies on the [[Camino de Santiago|Road of St. James]] (one of the most important Christian pilgrimage routes in the world) which leads to the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Cathedral of Santiago de Compostella]] in Spain.\n\n== Natural conditions ==\nAccording to the data of January 1, 2009, the area of the city is 21. 88 km\u00b2<ref name=\"powierzchnia\">|https://web.archive.org/web/20131220071949/http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/5840_908_PLK_HTML.htm</ref>, placing the city on the third position in the province. The town is also the fifth largest in the Warmia and Mazury region and the fifth in the population.\n\nI\u0142awa and its surroundings lie on undulating [[moraine]] and sandstone areas, distinguished by varied forms of sculpture. Within the city, on Lake Jeziorak (the longest lake in Poland and the sixth largest) is the island of [[Wielka \u017bu\u0142awa]] with relics of an Old Prussian town. In the vicinity of the city, in the sand terrain, there are lakes, mainly [[gutter lakes]], surrounded by significant forest complexes. In I\u0142awa itself, apart from the mentioned Jeziorak, there are a dozen or so smaller lakes(i.a. Little Jeziorak, I\u0142awskie, D\u00f3\u0142).

The town was under the jurisdiction of the [[komtur]] of [[Dzierzgo\u0144|Christburg (Dzierzgo\u0144)]] and since 1340 under [[Ostr\u00f3da|Osterode (Ostr\u00f3da)]].\n\nAt the start of the [[Thirteen Years\u2019 War (1454\u20131466)]] in February 1454, I\u0142awa sided with the [[Prussian Confederation]], at the request of which King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland.<ref name=IL>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilawa.pl/page/163,Historia-i-legendy.html|title=Historia i legendy, Urz\u0105d Miasta I\u0142awy - serwis miejski|accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref> In April 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King. After Poland's loss at the [[Battle of Chojnice (1454)|Battle of Chojnice]], in November 1454 it was taken over by the Teutonic Knights,<ref name=IL/> who handed over its defence to [[Czechs|Czech]] mercenaries. In 1457, the unpaid Czech mercenaries sold the town to Poland. After the [[Second Peace of Toru\u0144|peace treaty]] signed in [[Toru\u0144]] in 1466 the town came under Polish suzerainty as a [[fief]].<ref name=IL/> In 1520 Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]] granted I\u0142awa the right to collect tolls on the bridge over Jeziorak.\n\nIn 1525 the town became part of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], a vassal state of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]],<ref name=IL/> and in 1701 it became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the new province of [[West Prussia]] in 1773, it became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. During the [[Seven Years' War]], the town was occupied by [[Russia]] between 1758 and 1762.\n\nIn 1862 the [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]] was built between [[Elbl\u0105g|Elbing (Elbl\u0105g)]] and Eylau by engineer [[Georg Steenke]], which enabled the inland town to transport bulk of lumber, farm products, and other goods north to Elbing and the [[Baltic Sea]]. This was superseded ten years later by rail transport, when the [[Toru\u0144|Thorn (Toru\u0144)]]-[[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg (Chernyakhovsk)]] railway line was constructed.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Jeziorak Ma\u0142y 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Town view from the [[Jeziorak|Jeziorak Lake]] in the early 20th century]]\nAfter Poland regained its independence in 1918, the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] of 1920 allowed the residents to cast votes either in favor of remaining in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] or becoming a part of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]].

The historic Polish name ''I\u0142awa'' was adopted to replace the Germanized name.\n\n== Toponyms ==\nThe name I\u0142awa is thought to originate from the ancient Prussian word ''ilis'', meaning black. The related Baltic-Slavic word ''ilo'' or ''ilu'' means the black colour but also mud. The name might refer to the swampy area where the city lies, or to the dark water of the lake Jeziorak.<ref>[https://www.pojezierzeilawskie.pl/ilawa.html I\u0142awa, miasto z b\u0142ota]</ref>\n\nThe oldest written form of the name I\u0142awa is Latin Ylavia. This form appeared on a location document from 1317. Later documents of 1333 and 1334 mention Ylav, while the variety Ylau is mentioned in 1338. In the fifteenth century, the form Ylow and Ylow Thethonicalis appeared. In the years 1430 and 1438, the documents issued by the Dzierzgon command post spoke of Deutschen Ylaw. In the years 1443, 1457 and 1458 the town was named Ylau, and in 1456 it took the form of Ilau, then in 1459 it was changed to Eylaw. The name Deutze Eylau is used in 1457 and its other form Dwetsch Eylau in 1468. Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the names Teutschen Eylau, Deutscheneylau and Theuto Ilavia appear. In the 18th century, the Deutsch Eylau form was adopted, valid until 1933. On 1 January 1934 the name was changed to Stadt Deutsch Eylau (Stadt - en. The town), and since 1945 the Polish name of the town is I\u0142awa, which was officially approved on 7 May 1946.<ref name=\"zarz\">Zarz\u0105dzenie Ministr\u00f3w: Administracji Publicznej i Ziem Odzyskanych z dnia 7 maja 1946 r.

This anomaly continues for the sake of tradition, as Buckingham Palace is to all intents and purposes the [[official residence]].

It has been a focal point for the [[British people]] at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\n\nOriginally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building at the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by [[King George&nbsp;III]] in 1761<ref name=\"rob14\">Robinson, p. 14.</ref> as a private residence for [[Queen Charlotte]] and became known as ''The Queen's House''. During the 19th&nbsp;century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[Edward Blore]], who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837.\n\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during [[World War II]]; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].\n\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough|Sir&nbsp;Charles Long]]. [[King Edward&nbsp;VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The palace has 775 rooms, and [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the garden]] is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.\n\n==History==\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|Buckingham House, c. 1710, was designed by [[William Wind]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.<!--note - \"Normanby\" is correct spelling, do not change please --> This fa\u00e7ade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above it.]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the site of the future palace formed part of the [[Manor of Ebury]] (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.<ref>Goring, p. 15.</ref> Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th&nbsp;century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{efn|The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1\u20134.}}\n\nIn 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St&nbsp;James, which became [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]],<ref>Goring, p. 28.</ref> from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.<ref>Goring, p. 18.</ref> These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair |work=[[Survey of London]] |publisher=London County Council |year=1977 |volume=39 |pages=1\u20135 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Acquisition of the Estate |access-date=3 February 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820}}</ref>\n\nVarious owners leased it from royal landlords, and the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th&nbsp;century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.<ref>Wright, pp. 76\u201378.</ref> Needing money, [[James&nbsp;I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today's palace.)<ref>Goring, pp. 31, 36.</ref> [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th&nbsp;century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir&nbsp;[[Hugh Audley]] by the great heiress Mary Davies.{{efn|Audley and Davies were key figures in the development of Ebury Manor and also the Grosvenor Estate (see [[dukes of Westminster]]), which still exists today.

It has been a focal point for the [[British people]] at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\n\nOriginally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building at the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by [[King George&nbsp;III]] in 1761<ref name=\"rob14\">Robinson, p. 14.</ref> as a private residence for [[Queen Charlotte]] and became known as ''The Queen's House''. During the 19th&nbsp;century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[Edward Blore]], who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837.\n\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during [[World War II]]; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].\n\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough|Sir&nbsp;Charles Long]]. [[King Edward&nbsp;VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The palace has 775 rooms, and [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the garden]] is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.\n\n==History==\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|Buckingham House, c. 1710, was designed by [[William Winde]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.<!--note - \"Normanby\" is correct spelling, do not change please --> This fa\u00e7ade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above it.]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the site of the future palace formed part of the [[Manor of Ebury]] (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.<ref>Goring, p. 15.</ref> Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th&nbsp;century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{efn|The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1\u20134.}}\n\nIn 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St&nbsp;James, which became [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]],<ref>Goring, p. 28.</ref> from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.<ref>Goring, p. 18.</ref> These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair |work=[[Survey of London]] |publisher=London County Council |year=1977 |volume=39 |pages=1\u20135 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Acquisition of the Estate |access-date=3 February 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820}}</ref>\n\nVarious owners leased it from royal landlords, and the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th&nbsp;century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.<ref>Wright, pp. 76\u201378.</ref> Needing money, [[James&nbsp;I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today's palace.)<ref>Goring, pp. 31, 36.</ref> [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery.

Up until the semifinal and final rounds, the judges decide whether or not a contestant advances in the competition. During the semifinal and final rounds, viewers vote on which contestants will advance.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nThe general selection process of each season is begun by the production team with open auditions held in various cities across the [[India]]. Dubbed \"Producers' Auditions\", they are held months before the main stage of auditions are held. Those that make it through the initial stage, become participants in the \"Judges' Auditions\", which are held in select cities across the country, and attended by the judges. Each participant is held offstage and awaits their turn to perform before the judges, whereupon they are given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act, with a live audience present for all performances. At the end of a performance, the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw, whereupon they each give a vote - a participant who receives a majority vote approving their performance, moves on to the next stage, otherwise they are eliminated from the show at that stage. Each judge has a buzzer, and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed, hate what is being performed, or feel the act is a waste of their time; if a participant is buzzed by all judges, their performance is automatically over and they are eliminated without being given a vote. Many acts that move on may be cut by producers and may forfeit due to the limited slots available for the second performance. Filming for each season always takes place when the Judges' Auditions are taking place, with the show's presenter standing in the wings of each venue's stage to interview and give personal commentary on a participant's performance.\n\n===Quarter Finals/Semi-Finals===\nDuring this round, the final selection of participants, which has ranged from between 20 and 60 acts and include those that were chosen as Wildcards by the judges or received the Golden Buzzer, are divided into groups and compete against each other for viewers' and judges' votes. The general structure of the live episodes focuses first on four quarterfinals, and then two semi-finals, aimed at finding that season's finalists. Additional rounds are conducted when required (such as a \"Top 8\" or a \"Top 10\", depending on the season). During these stages, the judges still provide feedback on an act's performance when it is over, and can use buzzers to prematurely end a performance before it is over; in the first season, the judges could not end a performance before it was over. Acts which do not secure a sufficient number of votes by the public and/or the judges, are eliminated from the competition.\n\n==Judges==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Judge\n! colspan=\"8\" |Season\n|-\n![[India's Got Talent (season 1)|'''1''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 2)|'''2''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 3)|'''3''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 4)|'''4''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 5)|'''5''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 6)|'''6''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 7)|'''7''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 8)|'''8''']]\n|-\n|'''[[Kirron Kher]]''' \n| colspan=\"8\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Sonali Bendre]]''' \n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Shekhar Kapur]]''' \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Sajid Khan (director)|Sajid Khan]]''' \n| {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Dharmendra]]''' \n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Karan Johar]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Malaika Arora]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Farah Khan]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n!Total No.\n! colspan=\"3\" |3\n!4\n! colspan=\"4\" |3\n|}\n\n==Hosts==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Host\n! colspan=\"8\" |Season\n|-\n![[India's Got Talent (season 1)|'''1''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 2)|'''2''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 3)|'''3''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 4)|'''4''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 5)|'''5''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 6)|'''6''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 7)|'''7''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 8)|'''8''']]\n|-\n|'''Nikhil Chinapa'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Ayushmann Khurrana]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Gautam Rode]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Meiyang Chang]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Manish Paul]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Cyrus Sahukar]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Bharti Singh]]'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|-\n|[[Mantra (Actor)|'''Mantra''']]\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[VJ Andy]]'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Nakuul Mehta]]'''\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Siddharth Shukla]]'''\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|{{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Rithvik Dhanjani]]'''\n| colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|-\n!Total No.\n! colspan=\"4\" |2\n! colspan=\"2\" |3\n! colspan=\"2\" |2\n|}\n\n==Season summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season !!Premiere \n!Finale!!Episodes !!Winning Act\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 1)|1]]\n| 27 June 2009\n|22 August 2009\n| 25\n| [[Prince Dance Group]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 2)|2]]\n| 30 July 2010\n|1 October 2010\n| 19\n| [[Shillong Chamber Choir]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 3)|3]]\n| 29 July 2011\n|24 September 2011\n| 18\n| [[Kings United|Suresh]] and Vernon Group\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 4)|4]]\n| 22 September 2012\n|24 November 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 17\n| Biwas Dance Group (Sumanth and [[Sonali Majumdar]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 5)|5]]\n| 11 January 2014\n|8 March 2014\n| Raagini Makkar and Naadyog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 6)|6]]\n| 18 April 2015\n|27 June 2015\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 21\n| Aerial dancer Manik Paul\n|-\n! scope=''row''|[[India's Got Talent (Season 7)|7]]\n| 30 April 2016\n|9 July 2016\n| Flautist Suleiman\n|-\n! scope=''row''|[[India's Got Talent (Season 8)|8]]\n| 20 October 2018\n|29 December 2018\n| Javed Khan <small>(Close-up Magician)</small>\n|}\n\n==Season overview==\n===Season 1===\nThe Season 1 of the show was presented together by Nikhil Chinapa and [[Ayushmann Khurrana]]<ref name=\"indias-got-talent.com\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indias-got-talent.com/hosts/ |title=India's Got Talent Hosts |access-date=9 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901183439/http://www.indias-got-talent.com/hosts/ |archive-date=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the special segment called ''India's Got More Talent'' was hosted by [[Roshni Chopra]].

Up until the semifinal and final rounds, the judges decide whether or not a contestant advances in the competition. During the semifinal and final rounds, viewers vote on which contestants will advance.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nThe general selection process of each season is begun by the production team with open auditions held in various cities across the [[India]]. Dubbed \"Producers' Auditions\", they are held months before the main stage of auditions are held. Those that make it through the initial stage, become participants in the \"Judges' Auditions\", which are held in select cities across the country, and attended by the judges. Each participant is held offstage and awaits their turn to perform before the judges, whereupon they are given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act, with a live audience present for all performances. At the end of a performance, the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw, whereupon they each give a vote - a participant who receives a majority vote approving their performance, moves on to the next stage, otherwise they are eliminated from the show at that stage. Each judge has a buzzer, and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed, hate what is being performed, or feel the act is a waste of their time; if a participant is buzzed by all judges, their performance is automatically over and they are eliminated without being given a vote. Many acts that move on may be cut by producers and may forfeit due to the limited slots available for the second performance. Filming for each season always takes place when the Judges' Auditions are taking place, with the show's presenter standing in the wings of each venue's stage to interview and give personal commentary on a participant's performance.\n\n===Quarter Finals/Semi-Finals===\nDuring this round, the final selection of participants, which has ranged from between 20 and 60 acts and include those that were chosen as Wildcards by the judges or received the Golden Buzzer, are divided into groups and compete against each other for viewers' and judges' votes. The general structure of the live episodes focuses first on four quarterfinals, and then two semi-finals, aimed at finding that season's finalists. Additional rounds are conducted when required (such as a \"Top 8\" or a \"Top 10\", depending on the season). During these stages, the judges still provide feedback on an act's performance when it is over, and can use buzzers to prematurely end a performance before it is over; in the first season, the judges could not end a performance before it was over. Acts which do not secure a sufficient number of votes by the public and/or the judges, are eliminated from the competition.\n\n==Judges==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Judge\n! colspan=\"8\" |Season\n|-\n![[India's Got Talent (season 1)|'''1''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 2)|'''2''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 3)|'''3''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 4)|'''4''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 5)|'''5''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 6)|'''6''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 7)|'''7''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 8)|'''8''']]\n|-\n|'''[[Kirron Kher]]''' \n| colspan=\"8\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Sonali Bendre]]''' \n| colspan=\"3\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Shekhar Kapur]]''' \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Sajid Khan (director)|Sajid Khan]]''' \n| {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Dharmendra]]''' \n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Karan Johar]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Malaika Arora]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=\"5\" {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n|-\n|'''[[Farah Khan]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}} \n| {{yes2|'''Judge'''}} \n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n!Total No.\n! colspan=\"3\" |3\n!4\n! colspan=\"4\" |3\n|}\n\n==Hosts==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Host\n! colspan=\"8\" |Season\n|-\n![[India's Got Talent (season 1)|'''1''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 2)|'''2''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 3)|'''3''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 4)|'''4''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 5)|'''5''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 6)|'''6''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 7)|'''7''']]\n![[India's Got Talent (season 8)|'''8''']]\n|-\n|'''Nikhil Chinapa'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Ayushmann Khurrana]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Gautam Rode]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Meiyang Chang]]'''\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Manish Paul]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Cyrus Sahukar]]'''\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Bharti Singh]]'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|-\n|[[Mantra (Actor)|'''Mantra''']]\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[VJ Andy]]'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Nakuul Mehta]]'''\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Siddharth Shukla]]'''\n| colspan=\"5\" {{n/a|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|{{n/a|}}\n|-\n|'''[[Rithvik Dhanjani]]'''\n| colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}}\n|{{No2|'''Host'''}}\n|-\n!Total No.\n! colspan=\"4\" |2\n! colspan=\"2\" |3\n! colspan=\"2\" |2\n|}\n\n==Season summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season !!Premiere \n!Finale!!Episodes !!Winning Act\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 1)|1]]\n| 27 June 2009\n|22 August 2009\n| 25\n| [[Prince Dance Group]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 2)|2]]\n| 30 July 2010\n|1 October 2010\n| 19\n| [[Shillong Chamber Choir]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 3)|3]]\n| 29 July 2011\n|24 September 2011\n| 18\n| [[Kings United|Suresh]] and Vernon Group\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 4)|4]]\n| 22 September 2012\n|24 November 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 17\n| Biwas Dance Group (Sumanth and [[Sonali Majumdar]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 5)|5]]\n| 11 January 2014\n|8 March 2014\n| Raagini Makkar and Naadyog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[India's Got Talent (season 6)|6]]\n| 18 April 2015\n|27 June 2015\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 21\n| Aerial dancer Manik Paul\n|-\n! scope=''row''|[[India's Got Talent (Season 7)|7]]\n| 30 April 2016\n|9 July 2016\n| Flautist Suleiman\n|-\n! scope=''row''|[[India's Got Talent (Season 8)|8]]\n| 20 October 2018\n|29 December 2018\n| Javed Khan <small>(Close-up Magician)</small>\n|}\n\n==Season overview==\n===Season 1===\nThe Season 1 of the show was presented together by Nikhil Chinapa and [[Ayushmann Khurrana]]<ref name=\"indias-got-talent.com\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indias-got-talent.com/hosts/ |title=India's Got Talent Hosts |access-date=9 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901183439/http://www.indias-got-talent.com/hosts/ |archive-date=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the special segment called ''India's Got More Talent'' was hosted by [[Roshni Chopra]].

Tiger is forced to kill one of his own men who has defected to [[Pakistan]]'s spy agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). He subsequently kills many ISI agents in his escape from Iraq, returns to [[India]] and reports to his boss, Shenoy ([[Girish Karnad]]), in [[New Delhi]].\n\nTiger is later sent on a mission to [[Dublin]] to observe a scientist of Indian origin, Professor Anwar Kidwai ([[Roshan Seth]]), who teaches at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] and is suspected of sharing his findings with the Pakistan defence establishment. Fellow RAW agent Gopi ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) accompanies Tiger on this mission.\n\nTiger meets Kidwai but fails to spend enough time for his observance and instead begins to spend time with the scientist's caretaker Zoya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), who is studying at a local dance academy. He tries to befriend Zoya to extract information, but begins to grow closer to her. Tiger is attacked and robbed at his residence, and immediately suspects he has been found by an ISI agent.\n\nDespite several warnings from Gopi to not let any personal feelings get in the way of the mission, Tiger falls in love with Zoya. Tiger asks Zoya out on a date, and there they both came to know about their feelings for each other. However, during a visit to the dance academy, Tiger discovers that Zoya is an ISI agent, and was tasked on the same mission as Tiger. She refuses to commit treason, but instead of killing Zoya, Tiger lets her go.\n\nSome time later, Tiger and Zoya meet again at a [[United Nations|UN]] Foreign Minister's Meeting in [[Istanbul]]. They subsequently decide to go on the run together, escaping to [[Havana]], but having told their agencies that they would travel to [[Kazakhstan]], to arrest one another. Some time later, their agencies trace Zoya and Tiger after they foil an attempted robbery, and the ISI agents apprehend Zoya. Tiger then meets Gopi, and tells him he has convinced Zoya to return to India and cooperate with RAW, but requires Gopi to help save Zoya from the ISI agents.

Tiger is forced to kill one of his own men who has defected to [[Pakistan]]'s spy agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). He subsequently kills many ISI agents in his escape from Iraq, returns to [[India]] and reports to his boss, Shenoy ([[Girish Karnad]]), in [[New Delhi]].\n\nTiger is later sent on a mission to [[Dublin]] to observe a scientist of Indian origin, Professor Anwar Kidwai ([[Roshan Seth]]), who teaches at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] and is suspected of sharing his findings with the Pakistan defence establishment. Fellow RAW agent Gopi ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) accompanies Tiger on this mission.\n\nTiger meets Kidwai but fails to spend enough time for his observance and instead begins to spend time with the scientist's caretaker Zoya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), who is studying at a local dance academy. He tries to befriend Zoya to extract information, but begins to grow closer to her. Tiger is attacked and robbed at his residence, and immediately suspects he has been found by an ISI agent.\n\nDespite several warnings from Gopi to not let any personal feelings get in the way of the mission, Tiger falls in love with Zoya. Tiger asks Zoya out on a date, and there they both came to know about their feelings for each other. However, during a visit to the dance academy, Tiger discovers that Zoya is an ISI agent, and was tasked on the same mission as Tiger. She refuses to commit treason, but instead of killing Zoya, Tiger lets her go.\n\nSome time later, Tiger and Zoya meet again at a [[United Nations|UN]] Foreign Minister's Meeting in [[Istanbul]]. They subsequently decide to go on the run together, escaping to [[Havana]], but having told their agencies that they would travel to [[Kazakhstan]], to arrest one another. Some time later, their agencies trace Zoya and Tiger after they foil an attempted robbery, and the ISI agents apprehend Zoya. Tiger then meets Gopi, and tells him he has convinced Zoya to return to India and cooperate with RAW, but requires Gopi to help save Zoya from the ISI agents. The pair then trick Gopi, and escape aboard a secret plane.\n\nSome time later, Tiger calls Shenoy, and says they will only return when Pakistan and India no longer need ISI and RAW. In the epilogue, several sightings of Tiger and Zoya in cities including [[Venice]], [[Cape Town]], [[Zurich]] and [[London]] are reported, but neither agency have been able to catch them. what happens next is shown in next part of movie named [[Tiger Zinda Hai]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Avinash Singh \"Tiger\" Rathore, a [[Research and Analysis Wing|RAW]] agent who goes undercover to spy on Kidwai, under the alias Manish Chandra.\n* [[Katrina Kaif]] as Zoya \"Zee\" Humaimi, an [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] agent posing as Kidawi's housemaid. \n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Gopi Arya, a RAW agent and Tiger's handler.\n* [[Girish Karnad]] as Dr. Shenoy, the chief of RAW, who poses a deep dislike of ISI and Pakistan.\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as Anwar Kidwai, an Indian technology professor who teaches in Ireland, whose computer program is coveted by both ISI and RAW.\n* [[Gavie Chahal]] as Captain Abrar, an ISI agent and Zoya's handler.\n* [[Imran Ansari]] as Imu Baby.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nInitially, [[Kabir Khan (director)|Kabir Khan]] was announced to be the director,<ref name=\"Salman YRF\">{{cite news |author=IE Agencies |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/salmankatrina-team-up-for-yrfs-ek-tha-tiger/785913/0 |title=Salman-Katrina team up for YRF's 'Ek Tha Tiger'|work=Indian Express |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> but after finalising the story, Kabir approached Shah Rukh Khan with the script.

Satyajit of Glamsham gave the album 4/5, saying, \"''Ek Tha Tiger'' roars with multi-cultured international musical feel, a musician delight that primarily targets classy listeners. Unlike massy tracks of [[Dabangg]], [[Wanted (2009 film)|Wanted]], [[Ready (2011 film)|Ready]] or [[Bodyguard (2011 Hindi film)|Bodyguard]], it has more classy appeal attached to it and all credits goes to composer's skillfulness in catching every aura, genre and format.\"<ref name=\"Music Review 1\"/> [[Indo-Asian News Service]] posting on [[CNN-IBN]] gave the album 4/5 and said that it \"offers the listener the romantic and action flavour of the movie. This one's definitely an entertaining affair with an array of sounds for music lovers.\"<ref name=\"Music Review 2\"/> Purva Desai of The Times of India also gave the album 4/5 and said that it was \"[a] good effort by Sohail Sen and Sajid-Wajid because the album is fresh and sounds new, where the music composers have made an attempt to incorporate world sounds. The music is so different from Kabir Khan's earlier films like Kabul Express and New York which makes the music of Ek Tha Tiger a welcome surprise!\"<ref name=\"Music Review 3\"/> Devesh Sharma of [[Filmfare]] gave the soundtrack 4/5, stating that \"[w]e are used to pulsating music in Salman Khan starrers, so this album is a tad disappointing in that sense.\" and also that \"The songs have a situational feel and let's hope they look better on screen than they sound.\"<ref name=\"Music Review 4\"/> Joginder Tuteja of [[Bollywood Hungama]] gave the album 3.5/5 and wrote, \"[t]he music of Ek Tha Tiger is good though one expected it to have gone all the way further up.\" and that \"In case of Ek Tha Tiger, there isn't any composition that puts you off. In fact what is noticeable is the fact that the overall sound of the album remains more or less consistent.\"<ref name=\"Music Review 5\"/>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+ List of positive awards and nominations\n|-\n!
