The most common are:\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single [[critical field]], above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to have a combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of [[Type-1.5 superconductor|Type-1.5]].\n\n=== By theory of operation ===\nIt is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth Gibney|date=5 March 2018|title=Surprise graphene discovery could unlock secrets of superconductivity|department=News|journal=Nature|volume=555|issue=7695|pages=151&ndash;2|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02773-w|pmid=29517044|quote=Superconductors come broadly in two types: conventional, in which the activity can be explained by the mainstream theory of superconductivity, and unconventional, where it can\u2019t.|bibcode=2018Natur.555..151G}}</ref>\n\n=== By critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered ''[[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul Michael|date=2011|title=The great quantum conundrum|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Alex M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\"Bednorz\" /> It may also reference materials that transition to superconductivity when cooled using [[liquid nitrogen]] \u2013 that is, at only ''T<sub>c</sub>''&nbsp;> 77&nbsp;K, although this is generally used only to emphasize that [[liquid nitrogen]] coolant is sufficient. Low temperature superconductors refer to materials with a critical temperature below 30 K. One exception to this rule is the [[Iron-based superconductor|iron pnictide]] group of superconductors which display behaviour and properties typical of high temperature superconductors, yet some of the group have critical temperatures below 30K.\n\n=== By material ===\nSuperconductor material classes include [[chemical element]]s (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]]), [[alloy]]s (such as [[niobium\u2013titanium]], [[germanium\u2013niobium]], and [[niobium nitride]]), [[ceramic]]s ([[YBCO]] and [[magnesium diboride]]), [[Iron-based superconductor|superconducting pnictides]] (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs) or [[organic superconductor]]s ([[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of [[carbon]]).\n\n== Elementary properties of superconductors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nMost of the physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the [[heat capacity]] and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these \"universal\" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===\n[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]].

The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\n\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the [[universe]], depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.<ref name=\"Gallop\" /> In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils have persisted for more than 23 years (as in August 2018) in superconducting [http://www.astro.oma.be/en/world-record-in-the-underground-laboratory-of-membach/ gravimeters].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=Francis|first2=Olivier|last3=Lecocq|first3=Thomas|title=Recording Belgium's Gravitational History|journal=Eos|language=en-US|volume=98|doi=10.1029/2017eo089743|year=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=de Viron|first2=Olivier|last3=Watlet|first3=Arnaud|last4=Meurers|first4=Bruno|last5=Francis|first5=Olivier|last6=Caudron|first6=Corentin|title=Geophysics From Terrestrial Time-Variable Gravity Measurements|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=55|issue=4|language=en|pages=2017RG000566|doi=10.1002/2017rg000566|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2017RvGeo..55..938V|year=2017}}</ref> In such instruments, the measurement principle is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere with a mass of 4 grams.\n\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].\n\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy \u0394''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if \u0394''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=8}}</ref> The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\n\nIn a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n===  Phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}} ===\n[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Behavior of heat capacity (c<sub>v</sub>, blue) and resistivity (\u03c1, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]\n''In superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a critical temperature ''T''<sub>c</sub>. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&nbsp;K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203K for H<sub>2</sub>S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=A|last2=Eremets|first2=M|last3=Troyan|first3=I|last4=Ksenofontov|first4=V|title=Conventional superconductivity at 203 kelvin at high pressures in the sulfur hydride system|journal=Nature|date=17 August 2015|volume=525|issue=2\u20133|pages=73\u201376|doi=10.1038/nature14964|pmid=11369082|arxiv=1506.08190|bibcode=2015Natur.525...73D}}</ref> [[Cuprate superconductor]]s can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90&nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&nbsp;K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved, although the nature of the pairing (<math>s</math> wave vs. <math>d</math> wave) remains controversial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=16}}</ref>\n''\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with kkhgjkghjgjh the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\n\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b1/''T''</sup> for some constant, \u03b1. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].\n\nThe [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting [[phase transition#Order parameters|phase transition]] was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]]. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated<ref>{{cite journal\n |author = R. L.

In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a [[disorder field|disorder field theory]], in which the [[vortex line]]s of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the [[Type II superconductor|type II]] regime and of first order (i.e., [[latent heat]]) within the [[Type I superconductor|type I]] regime, and that the two regions are separated by a [[tricritical point]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = H.

The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&nbsp;''\u03bb'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\n\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this\u2014it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\n\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\mathbf{H} = \\lambda^{-2} \\mathbf{H}\\, </math>\n\nwhere '''H''' is the magnetic field and \u03bb is the [[London penetration depth]].\n\nThis equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\n\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H<sub>c</sub>''.

In [[Type II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''<sub>''c''1</sub> leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''<sub>''c''2</sub>, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]]. Most pure [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors, except [[niobium]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, are Type&nbsp;I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type&nbsp;II.\n\n=== London moment ===\nConversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the [[London moment]], was put to good use in [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe&nbsp;B]]. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes.

They can also be used in large wind turbines to overcome the restrictions imposed by high electrical currents, with an industrial grade 3.6 megawatt superconducting windmill generator having been tested successfully in Denmark.<ref>Design and in-field testing of the world\u2019s first ReBCO rotor for a 3.6 MW wind generator\u201d by Anne Bergen, Rasmus Andersen, Markus Bauer, Hermann Boy, Marcel ter Brake, Patrick Brutsaert, Carsten B\u00fchrer, Marc Dhall\u00e9, Jesper Hansen and Herman ten Kate, 25 October 2019, Superconductor Science and Technology.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using [[cryotron]] switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make [[digital circuit]]s based on [[rapid single flux quantum]] technology and [[RF and microwave filter]]s for [[mobile phone]] base stations.\n\nSuperconductors are used to build [[Josephson junction]]s which are the building blocks of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s known. SQUIDs are used in [[scanning SQUID microscope]]s and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Series of Josephson devices are used to realize the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[volt]]. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a [[superconductor\u2013insulator\u2013superconductor]] Josephson junction can be used as a photon [[detector]] or as a [[Electronic mixer|mixer]]. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal- to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic [[calorimeter|micro-calorimeter]] photon [[detector]]s. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive [[bolometer]]s made from superconducting materials.\n\nOther early markets are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices based on [[high-temperature superconductivity]] outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in [[wind turbine]]s the lower weight and volume of superconducting generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Islam | year = 2014 | title = A review of offshore wind turbine nacelle: Technical challenges, and research and developmental trends. | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2081&context=eispapers1| journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 161\u2013176 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.085 |display-authors=etal| hdl = 10453/33256 }}</ref>\n\nPromising future applications include high-performance [[smart grid]], [[electric power transmission]], [[transformer]]s, [[SMES|power storage devices]], [[electric motor]]s (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in [[vactrain]]s or [[maglev train]]s), [[magnetic levitation device]]s, [[fault current limiter]]s, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Jacob|last2=Robinson|first2=Jason W.

The cheaply available coolant [[liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&nbsp;K, and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Main|Superconductor classification}}\nThere are many criteria by which superconductors are classified. The most common are:\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single [[critical field]], above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to have a combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of [[Type-1.5 superconductor|Type-1.5]].\n\n=== By theory of operation ===\nIt is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth Gibney|date=5 March 2018|title=Surprise graphene discovery could unlock secrets of superconductivity|department=News|journal=Nature|volume=555|issue=7695|pages=151&ndash;2|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02773-w|pmid=29517044|quote=Superconductors come broadly in two types: conventional, in which the activity can be explained by the mainstream theory of superconductivity, and unconventional, where it can\u2019t.|bibcode=2018Natur.555..151G}}</ref>\n\n=== By critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered ''[[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul Michael|date=2011|title=The great quantum conundrum|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Alex M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\"Bednorz\" /> It may also reference materials that transition to superconductivity when cooled using [[liquid nitrogen]] \u2013 that is, at only ''T<sub>c</sub>''&nbsp;> 77&nbsp;K, although this is generally used only to emphasize that [[liquid nitrogen]] coolant is sufficient. Low temperature superconductors refer to materials with a critical temperature below 30 K. One exception to this rule is the [[Iron-based superconductor|iron pnictide]] group of superconductors which display behaviour and properties typical of high temperature superconductors, yet some of the group have critical temperatures below 30K.\n\n=== By material ===\nSuperconductor material classes include [[chemical element]]s (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]]), [[alloy]]s (such as [[niobium\u2013titanium]], [[germanium\u2013niobium]], and [[niobium nitride]]), [[ceramic]]s ([[YBCO]] and [[magnesium diboride]]), [[Iron-based superconductor|superconducting pnictides]] (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs) or [[organic superconductor]]s ([[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of [[carbon]]).\n\n== Elementary properties of superconductors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nMost of the physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the [[heat capacity]] and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these \"universal\" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===\n[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]]. Both the massive and slim cables are rated for 12,500 [[amperes|A]]. ''Top:'' regular cables for [[LEP]]; ''bottom:'' superconductor-based cables for the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]]]\n[[File:Cross section of preform superconductor cable.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a preform superconductor rod from abandoned [[Superconducting Super Collider|Texas Superconducting Super Collider (SSC)]].]]\nThe simplest method to measure the [[electrical resistance]] of a sample of some material is to place it in an [[electrical circuit]] in series with a [[current source]] ''I'' and measure the resulting [[voltage]] ''V'' across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\n\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the [[universe]], depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.<ref name=\"Gallop\" /> In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils have persisted for more than 23 years (as in August 2018) in superconducting [http://www.astro.oma.be/en/world-record-in-the-underground-laboratory-of-membach/ gravimeters].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=Francis|first2=Olivier|last3=Lecocq|first3=Thomas|title=Recording Belgium's Gravitational History|journal=Eos|language=en-US|volume=98|doi=10.1029/2017eo089743|year=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=de Viron|first2=Olivier|last3=Watlet|first3=Arnaud|last4=Meurers|first4=Bruno|last5=Francis|first5=Olivier|last6=Caudron|first6=Corentin|title=Geophysics From Terrestrial Time-Variable Gravity Measurements|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=55|issue=4|language=en|pages=2017RG000566|doi=10.1002/2017rg000566|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2017RvGeo..55..938V|year=2017}}</ref> In such instruments, the measurement principle is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere with a mass of 4 grams.\n\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].\n\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy \u0394''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if \u0394''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=8}}</ref> The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\n\nIn a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n===  Phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}} ===\n[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Behavior of heat capacity (c<sub>v</sub>, blue) and resistivity (\u03c1, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]\nIn superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a critical temperature ''T''<sub>c</sub>. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&nbsp;K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203K for H<sub>2</sub>S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=A|last2=Eremets|first2=M|last3=Troyan|first3=I|last4=Ksenofontov|first4=V|title=Conventional superconductivity at 203 kelvin at high pressures in the sulfur hydride system|journal=Nature|date=17 August 2015|volume=525|issue=2\u20133|pages=73\u201376|doi=10.1038/nature14964|pmid=11369082|arxiv=1506.08190|bibcode=2015Natur.525...73D}}</ref> [[Cuprate superconductor]]s can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90&nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&nbsp;K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved, although the nature of the pairing (<math>s</math> wave vs. <math>d</math> wave) remains controversial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\n\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b1/''T''</sup> for some constant, \u03b1. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].\n\nThe [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting [[phase transition#Order parameters|phase transition]] was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]].

The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&nbsp;''\u03bb'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\n\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this\u2014it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\n\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\mathbf{H} = \\lambda^{-2} \\mathbf{H}\\, </math>\n\nwhere '''H''' is the magnetic field and \u03bb is the [[London penetration depth]].\n\nThis equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\n\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H<sub>c</sub>''. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state<ref>{{cite book\n |author=Lev D. Landau\n |author2=Evgeny M.

In [[Type II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''<sub>''c''1</sub> leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''<sub>''c''2</sub>, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]]. Most pure [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors, except [[niobium]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, are Type&nbsp;I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type&nbsp;II.\n\n=== London moment ===\nConversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the [[London moment]], was put to good use in [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe&nbsp;B]]. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes.

They are used in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]/[[NMR]] machines, [[mass spectrometer]]s, the beam-steering magnets used in [[particle accelerator]]s and plasma confining magnets in some [[tokamaks]]. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the [[pigment]] industries. They can also be used in large wind turbines to overcome the restrictions imposed by high electrical currents, with an industrial grade 3.6 megawatt superconducting windmill generator having been tested successfully in Denmark.<ref>Design and in-field testing of the world\u2019s first ReBCO rotor for a 3.6 MW wind generator\u201d by Anne Bergen, Rasmus Andersen, Markus Bauer, Hermann Boy, Marcel ter Brake, Patrick Brutsaert, Carsten B\u00fchrer, Marc Dhall\u00e9, Jesper Hansen and Herman ten Kate, 25 October 2019, Superconductor Science and Technology.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using [[cryotron]] switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make [[digital circuit]]s based on [[rapid single flux quantum]] technology and [[RF and microwave filter]]s for [[mobile phone]] base stations.\n\nSuperconductors are used to build [[Josephson junction]]s which are the building blocks of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s known. SQUIDs are used in [[scanning SQUID microscope]]s and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Series of Josephson devices are used to realize the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[volt]]. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a [[superconductor\u2013insulator\u2013superconductor]] Josephson junction can be used as a photon [[detector]] or as a [[Electronic mixer|mixer]]. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal- to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic [[calorimeter|micro-calorimeter]] photon [[detector]]s. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive [[bolometer]]s made from superconducting materials.\n\nOther early markets are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices based on [[high-temperature superconductivity]] outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in [[wind turbine]]s the lower weight and volume of superconducting generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Islam | year = 2014 | title = A review of offshore wind turbine nacelle: Technical challenges, and research and developmental trends. | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2081&context=eispapers1| journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 161\u2013176 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.085 |display-authors=etal| hdl = 10453/33256 }}</ref>\n\nPromising future applications include high-performance [[smart grid]], [[electric power transmission]], [[transformer]]s, [[SMES|power storage devices]], [[electric motor]]s (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in [[vactrain]]s or [[maglev train]]s), [[magnetic levitation device]]s, [[fault current limiter]]s, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Jacob|last2=Robinson|first2=Jason W.

The group does not require that members identify as gay or bisexual. The eligibility requirements for SFGMC are to be at least 18 years of age, to self identify as a man, and to pass the audition process defined by the Artistic Director. Today, with a membership of over 300 [[human voice|voices]], the SFGMC continues to present a wide range of music and perform for many different kinds of audiences.\n\n==Background==\n===Early challenges===\nThe SFGMC came into existence during the [[Gay rights#1975 - 1986|Gay Rights Movement]], which rose to national prominence after the Stonewall Riots in New York City in 1969. In 1977, openly gay candidate for San Francisco Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] began traveling around the United States to present what came to be known as the ''Hope Speech''.<ref>[[Randy Shilts|Shilts, Randy]], ''The Mayor of Castro Street''. 1982</ref> Speaking as an openly gay elected public official, he urged gay people to [[come out of the closet]] to oppose anti-gay efforts such as the [[Briggs Initiative]] and [[Anita Bryant]]'s Save Our Children campaign. Sims responded by forming the [[San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band|San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corps]], the world's first openly gay and lesbian performing arts group, early in 1978 and the SFGMC later that year. The chorus held its first rehearsal on October 30, 1978.\n\nHowever, the first public performance of the SFGMC took place exactly four weeks later, on November 27, at an impromptu memorial at [[San Francisco City Hall]] for Milk and Mayor [[George Moscone]], who had been [[Moscone\u2013Milk assassinations|assassinated]] earlier that day by former Supervisor [[Dan White]].<ref>{{cite news\n |author = Herron Zamora, Jim\n |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/11/28/NEWS1762.dtl&hw=san+francisco+gay+men+chorus&sn=159&sc=161\n |title = Moscone, Milk legacy hailed\n |publisher = Examiner\n |date = 28 Nov 1998\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n</ref> The SFGMC performed \"Thou, Lord, hast been our refuge\" (\"Herr Gott, du bist unsre Zuflucht\") by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] at the event, which was attended by at least 25,000\u201340,000 mourners who had marched to the City Hall from [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro Street]], which was represented by Milk in the Board of Supervisors.\n\nSims, who specialized in conducting bands and orchestras, soon appointed Dick Kramer (1927\u20132007) as SFGMC conductor. The two men co-directed SFGMC's first official concert, which took place on Dec. 20, 1978, at Everett Middle School, where the 115-voice chorus presented an eclectic program to a capacity crowd.\n\nDespite the precedent set by the band, chorus members debated whether to use the word \"gay\" in its name:\n\n{{quote|I remember ... an argument over whether to include the word \"gay\" in the title.

During that tour, the chorus performed in nine cities: [[Dallas]], [[Minneapolis]] ([[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]]), [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Detroit]], [[New York City]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Washington D.C.]] ([[Kennedy Center]]), [[Seattle]] (Seattle Opera House), then returned to San Francisco for a triumphant performance at [[Davies Symphony Hall]] where San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] awarded SFGMC the [[key to the city]]\u2014the first time that honor had been bestowed on a gay organization.<ref name=AdvocateTour>Rhynsburger, Mark. \"On the Road with the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus.\" ''The Advocate'', Issue 324, page 27, August 20, 1981.</ref> Although  the tour was a critical and artistic success, it left SFGMC with a debt of [[US$]]200,000, which was covered in part by the mortgages on the homes of three members.

There are now more than 250 LGBT choruses worldwide.\n\n===New music===\nIn the late 1970s, gay choral music was virtually nonexistent. Because the SFGMC wanted to perform music relevant to its members and audience, the group commissioned many works, slowly building a new repertoire for men's choruses as well as for the LGBT community. In 1979, SFGMC member Tad Dunlap composed what is possibly the first-ever gay-specific choral piece, \"I Understood,\" with lyrics from one of Harvey Milk's inspirational speeches.<ref>According to a founding member of the SFGMC.</ref> The SFGMC's 1986 commission, ''Invocation and Dance'' by [[David Conte]], was one of the earliest pieces to deal with [[AIDS]], and is now considered a standard of American [[TTBB]] choral literature.<ref>A web search reveals that the piece has been performed at numerous state and national conventions of the [[American Choral Directors Association]].</ref> ''NakedMan'', a song suite by Philip Littell and Robert Seeley commissioned by the SFGMC in 1996, instantly became one of the most important works in gay choral literature and is still widely performed by LGBT choruses.<ref>In a letter commemorating the work's 10th anniversary, Assemblyman  Mark Leno wrote: \"''NakedMan'' continues to be one of the most important choral pieces ever found in the history of gay men's choral music.\" Concert program, San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, April 17, 2006.</ref> \"Never Ever,\" the final movement of ''NakedMan,'' has found its way into the repertoire of high school and college choirs, especially as a graduation piece.<ref>One such example: {{cite journal\n |url=http://www.dsu.nodak.edu/digest.asp?ArticleID=592\n |title=Dickinson State University holds commencement exercises\n |publisher=Dickinson State Digest Vol: 19 \u2013 Iss: 37, May 20, 2002\n |accessdate=2007-03-11\n }}</ref> Dr. Stan Hill, SFGMC's conductor from 1989 to 2000, was a driving force behind many commissions.<ref>Hill is well known in GALA Choruses circles as being a passionate advocate for commissioning new LGBT works. For instance, Hill led the SFGMC's commissioning of ''NakedMan'' and its two sequels: ''Exile'' (also with the SFGMC) and ''Metamorphosis'' (with Twin Cities Gay Men's Chorus). Hill often presents clinics and workshops at GALA Choruses conferences on the topic of commissioning new works.</ref> In honor of its 30th anniversary in 2008, the chorus commissioned and performed new works by composers David Conte, [http://www.ericlanebarnes.com Eric Lane Barnes], Ilyas Iliya, [[L. Peter Deutsch]], and [http://bonusroundblog.blogspot.com/ Steve Schalchlin].\n\n===Recent commissions===\nIn 2011, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] created ''Testimony'', a choral work using lyrics taken from submissions to [[Dan Savage]]'s [[It Gets Better Project]]. The Chorus premiered ''Testimony'' in March 2012,<ref>{{YouTube|id=-XZRNL9ZnyM |title=It Gets Better: \"Testimony\" by SF Gay Men's Chorus & Stephen Schwartz}}</ref> and it has now been performed by several other gay men's choruses.\n\nAlso in 2011, the Chorus announced plans to commission a major new work based on the life and legacy of [[Harvey Milk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Creative Shout Out: Submit Title for Artistic Celebration \u2013 Harvey Milk Performance Piece Coming 2013 |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/7/prweb8615344.htm|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> The work, entitled ''I Am Harvey Milk'' and with music and lyrics by [[Andrew Lippa]], premiered at Nourse Theatre on June 26, 2013\u2014the same day on which the US Supreme Court ruled that Section 4 of DOMA and California Proposition 8 were both unconstitutional. Its Broadway premiere occurred on October 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Harvey Milk|url=http://www.iamharveymilknyc.com/|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, the Chorus performed the world premiere of ''Tyler's Suite'', dedicated to the memory of Tyler Clementi, a young gay man who [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|committed suicide]] in 2010 after experiencing bullying. Co-commissioned with several other gay choruses, it features movements composed by Stephen Schwartz, [[John Corigliano]], [[Jake Heggie]], and [[Ann Hampton Callaway]], all set to poetry by [[Pamela Stewart]]. Callaway joined the Chorus on stage as a soloist.\n\nIn April 2015, the Chorus presented the world premiere of ''#twitterlieder'', a 15-song cycle with music by James Eakin, set to lyrics by Charles Anthony Silvestri. Each song is a 140-character [[Twitter|tweet]].\n\n===AIDS===\nFrom the mid-1980s through the late 1990s, the chorus focused heavily on AIDS because of the huge impact the disease was having on its members and the broader LGBT community. \n{{quote|As AIDS took its toll, chorus members used concerts as a way to bring a sense of urgency to the public. The group's music became more somber and began including AIDS requiems. The chorus also became a place for members to talk openly about HIV and AIDS. Men shared tips on how to get into clinical drug trials and serenaded friends through their last breaths. For men who were fighting for their lives, often alone and estranged from parents who had turned their backs on gay children, the chorus became family.|Meredith May<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/04/ING97J7LD31.DTL\n | title = Gay Men's Chorus carries on\n | author = May, Meredith\n | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle\n | date = 4 June 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>}}\n\nHill describes the era as \"the worst of times,\" explaining that he spent every Wednesday and Sunday visiting members in hospitals.<ref>Interview with Dr. Stan Hill in the documentary film, ''Why We Sing'' (June, 2006).</ref> Members and former members who died of AIDS and other causes became known as the chorus's \"Fifth Section.\"<ref>The following article lists the names of chorus members of the Fifth Section.

In 2000, with the appointment of conductor Dr. Kathleen McGuire, the SFGMC expanded its community outreach. Over the next few years, appearances included: ''Giving Back'' concerts, which raised funds for women in 2000, young people in 2002, and breast cancer and AIDS in 2002; the SFGMC's first by-invitation concerts for elementary and high school students in 2002 and 2003; a performance at [[California Medical Facility|Vacaville prison]] for [[World AIDS Day]] in 2003; programming to reach out to [[transgender]], [[African American]], and faith-based communities in 2004; participation in [[Special Olympics]] events (2003\u20132005); the addition of a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language ensemble in 2005; and  sponsorship of an LGBT youth chorus in 2006.<ref>For more information about these activities, see:\n{{cite news\n |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/03/10/MN157635.DTL&hw=san+francisco+gay+men+chorus&sn=028&sc=326\n |title = Teaching the reality of gay life: Oakland schoolkids learn a rare lesson\n |author = May, Meredith\n |newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle\n |date = March 10, 2002\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.qcomedy.com/news2000.html\n |title = Year 2000 News Archive\n |publisher = QComedy.com\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.glsen-sfeb.org/newsletter-spring-2002.html\n |title = Newsletter Volume I\n |date = Spring 2002\n |publisher = GLSEN San Francisco/East Bay\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.maxonline.org/report/report09_02.htm\n |title = ''MAXreport'', September 2002\n |publisher = MAX Men's Associated Exchange\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2004-04-14/calendar/singing-praises/\n |title = Singing Praises: Are you there, God?\n |publisher = Village Voice Media for SF Weekly\n |date=April 14, 2004\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |author = Van Iquity, Sister Dana\n |url = http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&article_id=5840\n |title = Back To The Fabulous '50s With Gay Men's Chorus\n |publisher = San Francisco Bay Times\n |date=October 26, 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n{{cite web\n |author = Van Iquity, Sister Dana\n |url = http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&article_id=5056\n |title = GLAM Youth Choir's Stirring Debut\n |publisher = San Francisco Bay Times\n |date = May 25, 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n''Spirit of the Season'' event programs, Special Olympics, 2003 \u2013 2005; \"Inside News,\" ''HEPP (HIV & Hepatitis Education Prison Project) Report'', December 2003 Vol. 6, Issue 12, Page 9\n\n</ref>\n\nAfter a quarter-century of singing for gay rights, members of the SFGMC finally performed at St. Ignatius Church \u2013 this time without controversy \u2013 on Jan. 11, 2003, at a memorial for AIDS advocate and SFGMC alumnus, David Smith Fox (1952\u20132002).

For the first time in several years, the chorus sold out Davies Symphony Hall for its April 2011 concert: ''Words''. Subsequent 2012 and 2013 concerts at Davies and other venues also saw very strong attendance numbers. In December 2013 the chorus returned to the War Memorial Opera House after a long absence. SFGMC was invited to Los Angeles in the summer of 2014 as guests of the Gay Men's Chorus Of Los Angeles for a special joint performance of ''I Am Harvey Milk'' at Walt Disney Concert Hall.<ref>http://www.gmcla.org, August 2013</ref>\n\nFollowing the performance of ''I Am Harvey Milk'' in Los Angeles, SFGMC launched its 37th season, \"Journey,\" which included three sold-out holiday shows at the Nourse Theater (''Dancers, Prancers & Vixens''), two nights at Davies Symphony Hall (''Passion'') and three Pride weekend concerts (''Elton: The Sing-Along''). For ''Dancers, Prancers & Vixens'', the Chorus premiered a new work titled \"New Year's Carol,\" with music by Ola Gjeilo and words by Charles Anthony Silvestri. ''Passion'' included the Bay Area premiere of [[Jake Heggie]]'s \"For a Look or a Touch\" opera and the world premiere of James Eakin's \"#twitterlieder: 15 Tweets in 3 Acts,\" with words by Charles Anthony Silvestri.

The group does not require that members identify as gay or bisexual. The eligibility requirements for SFGMC are to be at least 18 years of age, to self identify as a man, and to pass the audition process defined by the Artistic Director. Today, with a membership of over 300 [[human voice|voices]], the SFGMC continues to present a wide range of music and perform for many different kinds of audiences.\n\n==Background==\n===Early challenges===\nThe SFGMC came into existence during the [[Gay rights#1975 - 1986|Gay Rights Movement]], which rose to national prominence after the Stonewall Riots in New York City in 1969. In 1977, openly gay candidate for San Francisco Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] began traveling around the United States to present what came to be known as the ''Hope Speech''.<ref>[[Randy Shilts|Shilts, Randy]], ''The Mayor of Castro Street''. 1982</ref> Speaking as an openly gay elected public official, he urged gay people to [[come out of the closet]] to oppose anti-gay efforts such as the [[Briggs Initiative]] and [[Anita Bryant]]'s Save Our Children campaign. Sims responded by forming the [[San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band|San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corps]], the world's first openly gay and lesbian performing arts group, early in 1978 and the SFGMC later that year. The chorus held its first rehearsal on October 30, 1978.\n\nHowever, the first public performance of the SFGMC took place exactly four weeks later, on November 27, at an impromptu memorial at [[San Francisco City Hall]] for Milk and Mayor [[George Moscone]], who had been [[Moscone\u2013Milk assassinations|assassinated]] earlier that day by former Supervisor [[Dan White]].<ref>{{cite news\n |author = Herron Zamora, Jim\n |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/11/28/NEWS1762.dtl&hw=san+francisco+gay+men+chorus&sn=159&sc=161\n |title = Moscone, Milk legacy hailed\n |publisher = Examiner\n |date = 28 Nov 1998\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n</ref> The SFGMC performed \"Thou, Lord, hast been our refuge\" (\"Herr Gott, du bist unsre Zuflucht\") by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] at the event, which was attended by at least 25,000\u201340,000 mourners who had marched to the City Hall from [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro Street]], which was represented by Milk in the Board of Supervisors.\n\nSims, who specialized in conducting bands and orchestras, soon appointed Dick Kramer (1927\u20132007) as SFGMC conductor. The two men co-directed SFGMC's first official concert, which took place on Dec. 20, 1978, at Everett Middle School, where the 115-voice chorus presented an eclectic program to a capacity crowd.\n\nDespite the precedent set by the band, chorus members debated whether to use the word \"gay\" in its name:\n\n{{quote|I remember ... an argument over whether to include the word \"gay\" in the title.

During that tour, the chorus performed in nine cities: [[Dallas]], [[Minneapolis]] ([[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]]), [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Detroit]], [[New York City]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Washington D.C.]] ([[Kennedy Center]]), [[Seattle]] (Seattle Opera House), then returned to San Francisco for a triumphant performance at [[Davies Symphony Hall]] where San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] awarded SFGMC the [[key to the city]]\u2014the first time that honor had been bestowed on a gay organization.<ref name=AdvocateTour>Rhynsburger, Mark. \"On the Road with the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus.\" ''The Advocate'', Issue 324, page 27, August 20, 1981.</ref> Although  the tour was a critical and artistic success, it left SFGMC with a debt of [[US$]]200,000, which was covered in part by the mortgages on the homes of three members.

There are now more than 250 LGBT choruses worldwide.\n\n===New music===\nIn the late 1970s, gay choral music was virtually nonexistent. Because the SFGMC wanted to perform music relevant to its members and audience, the group commissioned many works, slowly building a new repertoire for men's choruses as well as for the LGBT community. In 1979, SFGMC member Tad Dunlap composed what is possibly the first-ever gay-specific choral piece, \"I Understood,\" with lyrics from one of Harvey Milk's inspirational speeches.<ref>According to a founding member of the SFGMC.</ref> The SFGMC's 1986 commission, ''Invocation and Dance'' by [[David Conte]], was one of the earliest pieces to deal with [[AIDS]], and is now considered a standard of American [[TTBB]] choral literature.<ref>A web search reveals that the piece has been performed at numerous state and national conventions of the [[American Choral Directors Association]].</ref> ''NakedMan'', a song suite by Philip Littell and Robert Seeley commissioned by the SFGMC in 1996, instantly became one of the most important works in gay choral literature and is still widely performed by LGBT choruses.<ref>In a letter commemorating the work's 10th anniversary, Assemblyman  Mark Leno wrote: \"''NakedMan'' continues to be one of the most important choral pieces ever found in the history of gay men's choral music.\" Concert program, San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, April 17, 2006.</ref> \"Never Ever,\" the final movement of ''NakedMan,'' has found its way into the repertoire of high school and college choirs, especially as a graduation piece.<ref>One such example: {{cite journal\n |url=http://www.dsu.nodak.edu/digest.asp?ArticleID=592\n |title=Dickinson State University holds commencement exercises\n |publisher=Dickinson State Digest Vol: 19 \u2013 Iss: 37, May 20, 2002\n |accessdate=2007-03-11\n }}</ref> Dr. Stan Hill, SFGMC's conductor from 1989 to 2000, was a driving force behind many commissions.<ref>Hill is well known in GALA Choruses circles as being a passionate advocate for commissioning new LGBT works. For instance, Hill led the SFGMC's commissioning of ''NakedMan'' and its two sequels: ''Exile'' (also with the SFGMC) and ''Metamorphosis'' (with Twin Cities Gay Men's Chorus). Hill often presents clinics and workshops at GALA Choruses conferences on the topic of commissioning new works.</ref> In honor of its 30th anniversary in 2008, the chorus commissioned and performed new works by composers David Conte, [http://www.ericlanebarnes.com Eric Lane Barnes], Ilyas Iliya, [[L. Peter Deutsch]], and [http://bonusroundblog.blogspot.com/ Steve Schalchlin].\n\n===Recent commissions===\nIn 2011, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] created ''Testimony'', a choral work using lyrics taken from submissions to [[Dan Savage]]'s [[It Gets Better Project]]. The Chorus premiered ''Testimony'' in March 2012,<ref>{{YouTube|id=-XZRNL9ZnyM |title=It Gets Better: \"Testimony\" by SF Gay Men's Chorus & Stephen Schwartz}}</ref> and it has now been performed by several other gay men's choruses.\n\nAlso in 2011, the Chorus announced plans to commission a major new work based on the life and legacy of [[Harvey Milk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Creative Shout Out: Submit Title for Artistic Celebration \u2013 Harvey Milk Performance Piece Coming 2013 |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/7/prweb8615344.htm|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> The work, entitled ''I Am Harvey Milk'' and with music and lyrics by [[Andrew Lippa]], premiered at Nourse Theatre on June 26, 2013\u2014the same day on which the US Supreme Court ruled that Section 4 of DOMA and California Proposition 8 were both unconstitutional. Its Broadway premiere occurred on October 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Harvey Milk|url=http://www.iamharveymilknyc.com/|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, the Chorus performed the world premiere of ''Tyler's Suite'', dedicated to the memory of Tyler Clementi, a young gay man who [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|committed suicide]] in 2010 after experiencing bullying. Co-commissioned with several other gay choruses, it features movements composed by Stephen Schwartz, [[John Corigliano]], [[Jake Heggie]], and [[Ann Hampton Callaway]], all set to poetry by [[Pamela Stewart]]. Callaway joined the Chorus on stage as a soloist.\n\nIn April 2015, the Chorus presented the world premiere of ''#twitterlieder'', a 15-song cycle with music by James Eakin, set to lyrics by Charles Anthony Silvestri. Each song is a 140-character [[Twitter|tweet]].\n\n===AIDS===\nFrom the mid-1980s through the late 1990s, the chorus focused heavily on AIDS because of the huge impact the disease was having on its members and the broader LGBT community. \n{{quote|As AIDS took its toll, chorus members used concerts as a way to bring a sense of urgency to the public. The group's music became more somber and began including AIDS requiems. The chorus also became a place for members to talk openly about HIV and AIDS. Men shared tips on how to get into clinical drug trials and serenaded friends through their last breaths. For men who were fighting for their lives, often alone and estranged from parents who had turned their backs on gay children, the chorus became family.|Meredith May<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/04/ING97J7LD31.DTL\n | title = Gay Men's Chorus carries on\n | author = May, Meredith\n | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle\n | date = 4 June 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>}}\n\nHill describes the era as \"the worst of times,\" explaining that he spent every Wednesday and Sunday visiting members in hospitals.<ref>Interview with Dr. Stan Hill in the documentary film, ''Why We Sing'' (June, 2006).</ref> Members and former members who died of AIDS and other causes became known as the chorus's \"Fifth Section.\"<ref>The following article lists the names of chorus members of the Fifth Section.

In 2000, with the appointment of conductor Dr. Kathleen McGuire, the SFGMC expanded its community outreach. Over the next few years, appearances included: ''Giving Back'' concerts, which raised funds for women in 2000, young people in 2002, and breast cancer and AIDS in 2002; the SFGMC's first by-invitation concerts for elementary and high school students in 2002 and 2003; a performance at [[California Medical Facility|Vacaville prison]] for [[World AIDS Day]] in 2003; programming to reach out to [[transgender]], [[African American]], and faith-based communities in 2004; participation in [[Special Olympics]] events (2003\u20132005); the addition of a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language ensemble in 2005; and  sponsorship of an LGBT youth chorus in 2006.<ref>For more information about these activities, see:\n{{cite news\n |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/03/10/MN157635.DTL&hw=san+francisco+gay+men+chorus&sn=028&sc=326\n |title = Teaching the reality of gay life: Oakland schoolkids learn a rare lesson\n |author = May, Meredith\n |newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle\n |date = March 10, 2002\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.qcomedy.com/news2000.html\n |title = Year 2000 News Archive\n |publisher = QComedy.com\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.glsen-sfeb.org/newsletter-spring-2002.html\n |title = Newsletter Volume I\n |date = Spring 2002\n |publisher = GLSEN San Francisco/East Bay\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.maxonline.org/report/report09_02.htm\n |title = ''MAXreport'', September 2002\n |publisher = MAX Men's Associated Exchange\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2004-04-14/calendar/singing-praises/\n |title = Singing Praises: Are you there, God?\n |publisher = Village Voice Media for SF Weekly\n |date=April 14, 2004\n |accessdate=2007-03-09\n }}\n{{cite web\n |author = Van Iquity, Sister Dana\n |url = http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&article_id=5840\n |title = Back To The Fabulous '50s With Gay Men's Chorus\n |publisher = San Francisco Bay Times\n |date=October 26, 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n{{cite web\n |author = Van Iquity, Sister Dana\n |url = http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&article_id=5056\n |title = GLAM Youth Choir's Stirring Debut\n |publisher = San Francisco Bay Times\n |date = May 25, 2006\n |accessdate=2007-03-06\n }}\n''Spirit of the Season'' event programs, Special Olympics, 2003 \u2013 2005; \"Inside News,\" ''HEPP (HIV & Hepatitis Education Prison Project) Report'', December 2003 Vol. 6, Issue 12, Page 9\n\n</ref>\n\nAfter a quarter-century of singing for gay rights, members of the SFGMC finally performed at St. Ignatius Church \u2013 this time without controversy \u2013 on Jan. 11, 2003, at a memorial for AIDS advocate and SFGMC alumnus, David Smith Fox (1952\u20132002).

Tripp's action in secretly recording [[Monica Lewinsky]]'s confidential phone calls about her relationship with the president caused a sensation with their links to the earlier ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit and with the disclosing of intimate details. Tripp claimed that her motives were purely patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge in exchange for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from [[the Pentagon]] at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, while the administration called it standard procedure for a political appointee. From 2004, Tripp worked with her husband in a retail business in [[Middleburg, Virginia]].\n\n==Early life==\nTripp graduated in 1968 from [[Hanover Park High School]] in [[East Hanover, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EFD502D5C99C190&p_docnum=2&p_queryname=NaN&p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated4&p_nbid=J4BH4EDFMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg|title=The Ultimate New Jersey High School Yearbook: T-Z And Also...|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 27, 1999|accessdate=August 4, 2007|publisher=Newsbank.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804161334/http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc|archive-date=August 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was an [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] secretary at [[Fort George G.

Bush administration]], and kept her job when [[Bill Clinton]] took over in 1993. During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp out, so they arranged a job for her in the public affairs office in the Pentagon, which gave her a raise of $20,000 per year.<ref>Goldstein, Amy; and Sanchez, Rene.

Accessed October 9, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Involvement in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal==\nTripp became a close confidante of another former White House employee, [[Monica Lewinsky]], while they both worked in the Pentagon's public affairs office. According to Tripp, who was about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of [[literary agent]] [[Lucianne Goldberg]], began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.\n\nIn August 1997, [[Michael Isikoff]], from ''[[Newsweek]]'', reported that Tripp said that she had encountered [[Kathleen Willey]] coming out of the [[Oval Office]] \"disheveled\", that \"her face red and her lipstick was off.\" Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton's lawyer [[Robert S. Bennett]] said in the ''Newsweek'' article, \"Linda Tripp is not to be believed.\"<ref>[[Michael Isikoff|Isikoff, Michael]] and Thomas, Evan.

Accessed October 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn January 1998, Tripp gave the surreptitiously recorded tapes to then-[[Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] in exchange for [[immunity from prosecution]]. Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false [[affidavit]] denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in [[Arkansas]] in the ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to [[Subornation of perjury|suborn]] Tripp's [[perjury]] in the ''Clinton v. Jones'' suit to conceal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship as well as Tripp's claim regarding Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.<ref name=LarryKing>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/16/tripp.transcript/ Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live'], ''[[CNN]]'', February 16, 1999.

During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it [[Dry cleaning|dry-cleaned]]; Tripp convinced her not to.\n\nBased on Tripp's tapes, Starr obtained approval from [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] and the special court overseeing the Independent Counsel to expand Starr's investigation into the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, looking for potential incidents of perjury, to investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit [[Paula Jones]] had brought against Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/text012998.htm |title=Text of Reno's Petition for Starr |date=January 29, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nTripp also told Starr that she had evidence directly linking the White House to the [[Travelgate]], [[Filegate]], and [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy|Chinagate]] affairs, but Starr chose not to act on that, preferring to pursue the sex-related allegations.\n\nTripp maintained that she acted out of \"patriotic duty.\" Tripp also claimed that she taped Lewinsky out of self-defense, as she feared retaliation from the Clinton administration, also claiming Lewinsky had assured President Clinton that she had told only Tripp about their affair (which was untrue), thus making her a target since she refused to go along with perjuring herself to protect Lewinsky and the President.\n\nEventually both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a [[Washington, D.C.]], [[grand jury]] to answer questions, although Clinton appeared via [[closed circuit television]]. After the round of interrogation, the jurors offered Lewinsky the chance to offer any last words. \"I hate Linda Tripp,\" she said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/09/22/tripp/ |title=What goes around comes around?

However, the Maryland state court ruled that Lewinsky, who \"admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life,\" was not credible and Lewinsky's proposed testimony against Tripp was \"bathed in impermissible taint.\" As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000, when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case.<ref>Lewis, Neil A.

The Department of Defense then leaked other confidential information from Tripp's personnel and security files to the news media.

Tripp's action in secretly recording [[Monica Lewinsky]]'s confidential phone calls about her relationship with the president caused a sensation with their links to the earlier ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit and with the disclosing of intimate details. Tripp claimed that her motives were purely patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge in exchange for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from [[the Pentagon]] at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, while the administration called it standard procedure for a political appointee. From 2004, Tripp worked with her husband in a retail business in [[Middleburg, Virginia]].\n\n==Early life==\nTripp graduated in 1968 from [[Hanover Park High School]] in [[East Hanover, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EFD502D5C99C190&p_docnum=2&p_queryname=NaN&p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated4&p_nbid=J4BH4EDFMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg|title=The Ultimate New Jersey High School Yearbook: T-Z And Also...|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 27, 1999|accessdate=August 4, 2007|publisher=Newsbank.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804161334/http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc|archive-date=August 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was an [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] secretary at [[Fort George G.

Bush administration]], and kept her job when [[Bill Clinton]] took over in 1993. During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp out, so they arranged a job for her in the public affairs office in the Pentagon, which gave her a raise of $20,000 per year.<ref>Goldstein, Amy; and Sanchez, Rene.

According to Tripp, who was about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of [[literary agent]] [[Lucianne Goldberg]], began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.\n\nIn August 1997, [[Michael Isikoff]], from ''[[Newsweek]]'', reported that Tripp said that she had encountered [[Kathleen Willey]] coming out of the [[Oval Office]] \"disheveled\", that \"her face red and her lipstick was off.\" Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton's lawyer [[Robert S. Bennett]] said in the ''Newsweek'' article, \"Linda Tripp is not to be believed.\"<ref>[[Michael Isikoff|Isikoff, Michael]] and Thomas, Evan.

Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false [[affidavit]] denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in [[Arkansas]] in the ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to [[Subornation of perjury|suborn]] Tripp's [[perjury]] in the ''Clinton v. Jones'' suit to conceal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship as well as Tripp's claim regarding Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.<ref name=LarryKing>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/16/tripp.transcript/ Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live'], ''[[CNN]]'', February 16, 1999.

During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it [[Dry cleaning|dry-cleaned]]; Tripp convinced her not to.\n\nBased on Tripp's tapes, Starr obtained approval from [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] and the special court overseeing the Independent Counsel to expand Starr's investigation into the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, looking for potential incidents of perjury, to investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit [[Paula Jones]] had brought against Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/text012998.htm |title=Text of Reno's Petition for Starr |date=January 29, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nTripp also told Starr that she had evidence directly linking the White House to the [[Travelgate]], [[Filegate]], and [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy|Chinagate]] affairs, but Starr chose not to act on that, preferring to pursue the sex-related allegations.\n\nTripp maintained that she acted out of \"patriotic duty.\" Tripp also claimed that she taped Lewinsky out of self-defense, as she feared retaliation from the Clinton administration, also claiming Lewinsky had assured President Clinton that she had told only Tripp about their affair (which was untrue), thus making her a target since she refused to go along with perjuring herself to protect Lewinsky and the President.\n\nEventually both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a [[Washington, D.C.]], [[grand jury]] to answer questions, although Clinton appeared via [[closed circuit television]].

However, the Maryland state court ruled that Lewinsky, who \"admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life,\" was not credible and Lewinsky's proposed testimony against Tripp was \"bathed in impermissible taint.\" As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000, when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case.<ref>Lewis, Neil A.

In ''Stand by Me'', four boys in 1959 Castle Rock, Oregon, go on a hike to find the dead body of a missing boy.\n\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: one for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Drama Motion Picture]] and one for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please note: Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot section of an article about a film should generally be under 700 words long.

Thank you. -->\nIn 1985, author Gordie Lachance reads in the newspaper that his childhood best friend, Chris Chambers, has died. Gordie narrates an extended flashback, later revealed to be a story he is writing. The flashback tells of a childhood incident when he, Chris, and two buddies journeyed to find the body of a missing boy near the town of Castle Rock, Oregon during the Labor Day weekend in 1959.\n\nTwelve-year-old Gordie's parents are too busy grieving the recent death of Gordie's older brother Denny to pay any attention to Gordie. Gordie's friends are Chris, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio. While looking for money that he buried beneath his parents' porch, Vern overhears his older brother Billy talking with a friend. Recently, Billy and his friend saw the body of a missing boy named Ray Brower outside of town. Billy does not want to report the body because doing so could draw attention to the fact that he and his friend recently stole a car. When Vern tells Gordie, Chris, and Teddy, the four boys{{snd}} hoping to become local heroes{{snd}} decide to go looking for the body. After Chris steals his father's pistol, he and Gordie run into local hoodlum John \"Ace\" Merrill and Chris's older brother, Richard \"Eyeball\" Chambers. Ace threatens Chris with a lit cigarette and steals Gordie's Yankees cap, which had been a gift from Gordie's brother.\n\nThe four boys begin their journey. After stopping for a drink of water at a junkyard, they get caught trespassing by junkyard owner Milo Pressman and his dog, Chopper. They escape over a fence, and Pressman calls Teddy's mentally ill father a \"loony\"; Teddy, enraged, tries to attack him but is restrained by the other boys. The boys continue their hike, and Chris encourages Gordie to fulfill his potential as a writer despite his father's disapproval. Later, Gordie and Vern are nearly run over by a train while walking across a train bridge, but Gordie saves both their lives by throwing himself and Vern off the bridge at the last second.\n\nThat evening, Gordie tells the fictional story of David \"Lard-Ass\" Hogan, an obese boy who is constantly bullied. Seeking revenge, Lard-Ass enters a pie-eating contest and deliberately vomits, inducing mass vomiting (a \"barf-o-rama\") among contestants and the audience. During the night, Chris tells Gordie that he hates being associated with his family's reputation. Chris admits to Gordie that he stole milk money at school. However, he tells Gordie that he later confessed and returned the money to a teacher. Despite this, Chris was suspended; apparently, the teacher spent the money on herself instead of turning it in to her superiors. Devastated by the teacher's betrayal, Chris breaks down and cries.\n\nThe next day, the boys swim across a swamp and discover that it is filled with leeches. Gordie briefly faints after finding a leech on his groin. After more hiking, the boys locate Ray Brower's body. The discovery is traumatic for Gordie, who asks Chris why his brother Denny had to die and claims that his father hates him. Chris disagrees, asserting that Gordie's father simply does not know him well.\n\nAce and his gang arrive, announce that they are claiming the body, and threaten to beat the four boys if they interfere. When Chris insults Ace and refuses to back down from him, Ace draws a switchblade to kill him. Gordie comes to Chris's aid by firing a shot into the air with Chris's father's gun and then pointing the gun at Ace. Ace demands that Gordie give him the gun, but Gordie refuses, calling Ace a \"cheap dime-store hood\". Ace taunts Gordie by asking whether he plans to shoot Ace's entire gang, and Gordie responds, \"No, Ace. Just you.\u201d Ace and his gang depart, vowing revenge.\n\nThe four boys, agreeing that it would not be right for anyone to get the credit for finding the body, report it to the authorities via an anonymous phone call. They walk back to Castle Rock and part ways, and the extended flashback ends. The present-day Gordie explains that Chris later went to college and became a lawyer. When attempting to break up a fight in a restaurant, he was stabbed to death. Gordie ends his story with the following words: \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Wil Wheaton]] as Gordon \"Gordie\" Lachance (aged 12)\n** [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Gordon \"Gordie\" Lachance (adult; credited as \"The Writer\")\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Christopher \"Chris\" Chambers\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Theodore \"Teddy\" Duchamp\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Vernon \"Vern\" Tessio\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John \"Ace\" Merrill, gang leader\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as William \"Billy\" Tessio, gang member and Vern's big brother\n* [[John Cusack]] as Dennis \"Denny\" Lachance, Gordie's big brother\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Mr. Lachance\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Mrs. Lachance\n* [[Gary Riley]] as Charlie Hogan, gang member\n* [[Bradley Gregg]] as Richard \"Eyeball\" Chambers, gang member and Chris's big brother\n* Jason Oliver as Vince Desjardins, gang member\n* [[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] as Mr. Quidacioluo, store owner\n* [[William Bronder]] as Milo Pressman, junkyard manager\n* Andy Lindberg as David \"Lard-Ass\" Hogan\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mayor Grundy in \"Lard-Ass\" story\n* Madeleine Swift as Waitress\n* Kent Luttrell as Ray Brower (the dead body)\n* Popeye as Chopper, junkyard dog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted from the Stephen King novella ''[[The Body (novella)|The Body]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/all-the-stephen-king-easter-eggs-in-hulus-castle-rock-from-shawshank-to-sissy-spacek-106674|title=All the Stephen King Easter Eggs in Hulu's 'Castle Rock' \u2013 From Shawshank to Sissy Spacek|website=Entertainment Tonight|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> [[Bruce A.

In response, Evans and Gideon pursued an established director, [[Adrian Lyne]], to help sell the project.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nAfter reading the novella, Lyne teamed up with Evans and Gideon, but all the studios the trio approached turned the project down except for Martin Shafer at [[Embassy Pictures]]. Embassy spent four months negotiating the rights with McCauley, settling on $50,000 and a smaller share of the profits, and Evans and Gideon spent eight weeks writing the screenplay.

And through the experience of going to find the dead body and his friendship with these boys, he began to feel empowered and went on to become a very successful writer. He basically became Stephen King.\"<ref name=Telegraph11 /></blockquote>\n\nReiner has said that he identified with Gordie, as he himself struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father, [[Carl Reiner]].<ref name=Variety /> The writers incorporated Reiner's suggestions, producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy's review and approval.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nDays before shooting started in the summer of 1985, Embassy was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]], who made plans to cancel the production.<ref name=CT-861121 /> [[Norman Lear]], one of the co-owners of Embassy and the developer of ''All in the Family'', gave $7.5&nbsp;million of his own money to complete the film, citing his faith in Reiner and the script.<ref name=Variety /> However, since Embassy also would have distributed the film, once the film was completed it had no distributor.

The flashback tells of a childhood incident when he, Chris, and two buddies journeyed to find the body of a missing boy near the town of Castle Rock, Oregon during the Labor Day weekend in 1959.\n\nTwelve-year-old Gordie's parents are too busy grieving the recent death of Gordie's older brother Denny to pay any attention to Gordie. Gordie's friends are Chris, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio. While looking for money that he buried beneath his parents' porch, Vern overhears his older brother Billy talking with a friend. Recently, Billy and his friend saw the body of a missing boy named Ray Brower outside of town. Billy does not want to report the body because doing so could draw attention to the fact that he and his friend recently stole a car. When Vern tells Gordie, Chris, and Teddy, the four boys{{snd}} hoping to become local heroes{{snd}} decide to go looking for the body. After Chris steals his father's pistol, he and Gordie run into local hoodlum John \"Ace\" Merrill and Chris's older brother, Richard \"Eyeball\" Chambers. Ace threatens Chris with a lit cigarette and steals Gordie's Yankees cap, which had been a gift from Gordie's brother.\n\nThe four boys begin their journey. After stopping for a drink of water at a junkyard, they get caught trespassing by junkyard owner Milo Pressman and his dog, Chopper. They escape over a fence, and Pressman calls Teddy's mentally ill father a \"loony\"; Teddy, enraged, tries to attack him but is restrained by the other boys. The boys continue their hike, and Chris encourages Gordie to fulfill his potential as a writer despite his father's disapproval. Later, Gordie and Vern are nearly run over by a train while walking across a train bridge, but Gordie saves both their lives by throwing himself and Vern off the bridge at the last second.\n\nThat evening, Gordie tells the fictional story of David \"Lard-Ass\" Hogan, an obese boy who is constantly bullied. Seeking revenge, Lard-Ass enters a pie-eating contest and deliberately vomits, inducing mass vomiting (a \"barf-o-rama\") among contestants and the audience. During the night, Chris tells Gordie that he hates being associated with his family's reputation. Chris admits to Gordie that he stole milk money at school. However, he tells Gordie that he later confessed and returned the money to a teacher. Despite this, Chris was suspended; apparently, the teacher spent the money on herself instead of turning it in to her superiors. Devastated by the teacher's betrayal, Chris breaks down and cries.\n\nThe next day, the boys swim across a swamp and discover that it is filled with leeches. Gordie briefly faints after finding a leech on his groin. After more hiking, the boys locate Ray Brower's body. The discovery is traumatic for Gordie, who asks Chris why his brother Denny had to die and claims that his father hates him. Chris disagrees, asserting that Gordie's father simply does not know him well.\n\nAce and his gang arrive, announce that they are claiming the body, and threaten to beat the four boys if they interfere. When Chris insults Ace and refuses to back down from him, Ace draws a switchblade to kill him. Gordie comes to Chris's aid by firing a shot into the air with Chris's father's gun and then pointing the gun at Ace. Ace demands that Gordie give him the gun, but Gordie refuses, calling Ace a \"cheap dime-store hood\". Ace taunts Gordie by asking whether he plans to shoot Ace's entire gang, and Gordie responds, \"No, Ace. Just you.\u201d Ace and his gang depart, vowing revenge.\n\nThe four boys, agreeing that it would not be right for anyone to get the credit for finding the body, report it to the authorities via an anonymous phone call. They walk back to Castle Rock and part ways, and the extended flashback ends. The present-day Gordie explains that Chris later went to college and became a lawyer. When attempting to break up a fight in a restaurant, he was stabbed to death. Gordie ends his story with the following words: \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Wil Wheaton]] as Gordon \"Gordie\" Lachance (aged 12)\n** [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Gordon \"Gordie\" Lachance (adult; credited as \"The Writer\")\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Christopher \"Chris\" Chambers\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Theodore \"Teddy\" Duchamp\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Vernon \"Vern\" Tessio\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John \"Ace\" Merrill, gang leader\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as William \"Billy\" Tessio, gang member and Vern's big brother\n* [[John Cusack]] as Dennis \"Denny\" Lachance, Gordie's big brother\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Mr. Lachance\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Mrs. Lachance\n* [[Gary Riley]] as Charlie Hogan, gang member\n* [[Bradley Gregg]] as Richard \"Eyeball\" Chambers, gang member and Chris's big brother\n* Jason Oliver as Vince Desjardins, gang member\n* [[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] as Mr. Quidacioluo, store owner\n* [[William Bronder]] as Milo Pressman, junkyard manager\n* Andy Lindberg as David \"Lard-Ass\" Hogan\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Mayor Grundy in \"Lard-Ass\" story\n* Madeleine Swift as Waitress\n* Kent Luttrell as Ray Brower (the dead body)\n* Popeye as Chopper, junkyard dog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted from the Stephen King novella ''[[The Body (novella)|The Body]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/all-the-stephen-king-easter-eggs-in-hulus-castle-rock-from-shawshank-to-sissy-spacek-106674|title=All the Stephen King Easter Eggs in Hulu's 'Castle Rock' \u2013 From Shawshank to Sissy Spacek|website=Entertainment Tonight|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> [[Bruce A.

In response, Evans and Gideon pursued an established director, [[Adrian Lyne]], to help sell the project.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nAfter reading the novella, Lyne teamed up with Evans and Gideon, but all the studios the trio approached turned the project down except for Martin Shafer at [[Embassy Pictures]]. Embassy spent four months negotiating the rights with McCauley, settling on $50,000 and a smaller share of the profits, and Evans and Gideon spent eight weeks writing the screenplay.

He basically became Stephen King.\"<ref name=Telegraph11 /></blockquote>\n\nReiner has said that he identified with Gordie, as he himself struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father, [[Carl Reiner]].<ref name=Variety /> The writers incorporated Reiner's suggestions, producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy's review and approval.<ref name=CT-861121 />\n\nDays before shooting started in the summer of 1985, Embassy was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]], who made plans to cancel the production.<ref name=CT-861121 /> [[Norman Lear]], one of the co-owners of Embassy and the developer of ''All in the Family'', gave $7.5&nbsp;million of his own money to complete the film, citing his faith in Reiner and the script.<ref name=Variety /> However, since Embassy also would have distributed the film, once the film was completed it had no distributor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

She has also appeared in other media of these franchises and in a number of other games since her debut in 1992's ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' as the first female character in an SNK fighting game.

Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called respirators, a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the \"[[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators|Bird respirator]]\"). However, in contemporary hospital and medical terminology, a [[respirator]] is a protective face mask.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date=2019-02-08 |title=Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators |journal=FDA |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\". It was a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] device and therefore required no [[electrical power]] source to operate.\n\nIn 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]) and [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions.<ref>{{cite book |date=1965 |title=Army R, D & A. |publisher=Development and Engineering Directorate, HQ, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sTrO77DCgkwC&pg=RA6-PA33&lpg=RA6-PA33&dq=Army+Emergency+Respirator,+HDL#v=onepage&q=Army%20Emergency%20Respirator,%20HDL&f=false}}</ref> Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Mon |first1=George |last2=Woodward |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Straub |first3=Henrik |last4=Joyce |first4=James |last5=Meyer |first5=James |date=1966 |title=Fluid Amplifier-Controlled Medical Devices |journal=SAE Transactions |issn=0096-736X |jstor=44554326 |volume=74 |pages=217\u2013222}}</ref> The mask is composed of a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (commercially known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Lucite]]) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Army Research and Development Monthly Magazine |volume=6 |number=9 |url=https://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/archives/1965/Sep_1965.PDF}}</ref> The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller.

This design kept the same functionality of the in-hospital ventilators while allowing patient mobility.\n\nA modular concept was introduced with SERVO-i in 2001, with one ventilator model throughout the ICU department, instead of a fleet of various models and brands for different user needs. With the modular ventilator, ICU departments could choose the modes and options, software and hardware needed for a particular patient category.\n\nIn the twenty-first century small portable ventilators like the SAVe II have been manufactured for forward combat use.<ref name=Automedx>{{cite web |title=SAVe II The Smallest and Easiest to Use Pre-hospital Ventilator |publisher=Automedx |website=Automedx |url=http://automedx.com/save-ii/ |access-date=March 31, 2019}}</ref>-->\n\n== Open-source ventilators ==\n{{Main articles|Open-source ventilator}}\nAn [[Open source|open-source]] ventilator is a disaster-situation ventilator made using a freely-licensed design, and ideally, freely-available components and parts.

However, in contemporary hospital and medical terminology, a [[respirator]] is a protective face mask.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date=2019-02-08 |title=Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators |journal=FDA |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\". It was a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] device and therefore required no [[electrical power]] source to operate.\n\nIn 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]) and [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions.<ref>{{cite book |date=1965 |title=Army R, D & A. |publisher=Development and Engineering Directorate, HQ, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sTrO77DCgkwC&pg=RA6-PA33&lpg=RA6-PA33&dq=Army+Emergency+Respirator,+HDL#v=onepage&q=Army%20Emergency%20Respirator,%20HDL&f=false}}</ref> Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Mon |first1=George |last2=Woodward |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Straub |first3=Henrik |last4=Joyce |first4=James |last5=Meyer |first5=James |date=1966 |title=Fluid Amplifier-Controlled Medical Devices |journal=SAE Transactions |issn=0096-736X |jstor=44554326 |volume=74 |pages=217\u2013222}}</ref> The mask is composed of a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (commercially known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Lucite]]) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Army Research and Development Monthly Magazine |volume=6 |number=9 |url=https://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/archives/1965/Sep_1965.PDF}}</ref> The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller.

It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation.\n\nVentilators used under increased pressure (hyperbaric) require special precautions and few ventilators can operate under these conditions.<ref name=SPUMS1998>{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=M |year=1998 |title=Ventilator function under hyperbaric conditions |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5927 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> In 1979, Sechrist Industries introduced their Model 500A ventilator which was specifically designed for use with [[hyperbaric chamber]]s.<ref name=JHM1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver LK, Greenway L, Elliot CG |year=1988 |title=Performance of the Seachrist 500A Hyperbaric Ventilator in a Monoplace Hyperbaric Chamber |journal=Journal of Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=215\u2013225 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4377 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Microprocessor ventilators===\n[[Microprocessor control]] led to the third generation of [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) ventilators, starting with the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] EV-A<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00e4ger - die Geschichte des Unternehmens |language= |publisher=Dr\u00e4ger |website=Dr\u00e4ger |url=https://www.draeger.com/Corporate/Content/draeger_die_geschichte_des_unternehmens.pdf |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref> in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patients [[Breathing#Respiratory_disorders|breathing curve]] on an [[LCD monitor]].
