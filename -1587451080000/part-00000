The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was transferred permanently to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] program in 1924, in France. The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998.<ref name=schantz>{{cite web|last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses\u2014from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit\u00e9 International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505052232/http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref> However, the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018, citing financial reasons.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1988, the tournament started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]]. Other medal-winning nations include [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] and [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]].\n\nIn July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] teams have dominated the event. The United States won the first tournament in 1998 and the most recent in 2018. Canada has won all of the other tournaments (2002\u20132014).\n\n==Inception as an Olympic sport==\n[[Image:Winnipegfalcons.jpg|thumb|left|251px|Representing Canada, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] (''pictured en route to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]'') were the first Olympic champions in ice hockey.]]\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |title=Ice hockey |publisher=International Olympic Committee |access-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323022731/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |archive-date=23 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> At the time, organized international ice hockey was still relatively new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|publisher=C.R.

By contrast, the United States' team\u2014led by head coach [[Herb Brooks]]\u2014consisted exclusively of [[amateur]] players with mostly [[College ice hockey|college]] experience, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved several notable results, including a 2\u20132 draw against Sweden, and a 7\u20133 upset victory over second-place favorites [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]].\n\nFor the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. The first period finished tied at 2\u20132, and the Soviets lead 3\u20132 following the second. The U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4\u20133. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] in the final. The Soviet Union took the silver medal<!--Please do not change to Bronze. the USSR won Silver it was a round robin medal round--> by beating [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]].\n\nThe victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports.

In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], it would no longer cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that \"In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that\u2019s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes20160520\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

As to reasons the Board of Governors might be interested in re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject, the NHLPA \"confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=\"sn-nonhl2018\">{{cite web|title=NHL will not participate in 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in the following months the president of the IIHF Ren\u00e9 Fasel tried to convince NHL to change its decision,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/nhl-said-olympic-matter-is-closed-but-iihf-president-fasel-begs-to-differ |title=NHL said Olympic matter is closed, but IIHF president Fasel begs to differ |author=Jared Clinton |date=8 May 2017 |website=The Hockey News |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> in September he stated that there was no chance for participation of NHL players in the Pyeongchang olympic tournament. \"I can say that this is now gone.

The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was transferred permanently to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] program in 1924, in France. The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998.<ref name=schantz>{{cite web|last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses\u2014from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit\u00e9 International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505052232/http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref> However, the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018, citing financial reasons.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1988, the tournament started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]]. Other medal-winning nations include [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] and [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]].\n\nIn July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] teams have dominated the event. The United States won the first tournament in 1998 and the most recent in 2018. Canada has won all of the other tournaments (2002\u20132014).\n\n==Inception as an Olympic sport==\n[[Image:Winnipegfalcons.jpg|thumb|left|251px|Representing Canada, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] (''pictured en route to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]'') were the first Olympic champions in ice hockey.]]\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |title=Ice hockey |publisher=International Olympic Committee |access-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323022731/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |archive-date=23 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> At the time, organized international ice hockey was still relatively new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|publisher=C.R.

In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], it would no longer cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that \"In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that\u2019s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes20160520\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

As to reasons the Board of Governors might be interested in re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject, the NHLPA \"confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=\"sn-nonhl2018\">{{cite web|title=NHL will not participate in 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in the following months the president of the IIHF Ren\u00e9 Fasel tried to convince NHL to change its decision,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/nhl-said-olympic-matter-is-closed-but-iihf-president-fasel-begs-to-differ |title=NHL said Olympic matter is closed, but IIHF president Fasel begs to differ |author=Jared Clinton |date=8 May 2017 |website=The Hockey News |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> in September he stated that there was no chance for participation of NHL players in the Pyeongchang olympic tournament. \"I can say that this is now gone.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt has a total land area of 56.5 square kilometers and is bordered on the south and south-west by [[Mount Makiling]], on the north by [[Laguna de Bay]], on the north-west by [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and on the east by the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. The town is located {{convert|63|km}} southeast of [[Manila]] and is accessible via the [[South Luzon Expressway]].\n\nThe municipality lies on the northern slopes of the long dormant volcano [[Mount Makiling]] and is known among tourists for its hot spring resorts. Los Ba\u00f1os also hosts two constituent universities of the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines System]]: the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]] and [[University of the Philippines Open University]], along with other foreign and local and international research centers, such as the [[International Rice Research Institute]], the [[ASEAN]] Center for Biodiversity, the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]], [[Philippine Carabao Center]] at UPLB, and SEAMEO-SEARCA, making the town a temporary home for tens of thousands of both local and foreign undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and support staff.\n\nLos Ba\u00f1os was declared as the ''Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines'' through Presidential Proclamation No. 349.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proclamation Order No. 349, s. 2000: Designating and Declaring the Municipality of Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna as a Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines|url=http://www.gov.ph/2000/08/07/proclamation-order-no-349-s-2000/|website=www.gov.ph|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=26 May 2017|location=Manila|date=7 August 2000}}</ref> The proclamation, however, does not convert the municipality to a city or give it corporate powers that are accorded to other cities.\n\nAside from its importance in academics, science and research, Los Ba\u00f1os is a well-known tourist destination. Because of the town's proximity to [[Metro Manila]], Los Ba\u00f1os' [[hot spring]] resorts are frequent weekend or summer getaways for residents of the vast metropolis and tourists from other places in the Philippines and abroad. Tourists who visit Los Ba\u00f1os also come to the several native delicacies stores in the town to buy the town's famous ''[[buko pie]]'' (coconut meat pie) as well as a home-grown brand of chocolate cake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/851347/in-los-banos-giant-buko-pie-steals-christmas-show|title=In Los Ba\u00f1os, giant \u2018buko\u2019 pie steals Christmas show|last=Cinco|first=Maricar|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref name=mernels-abscbn>{{cite web |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/12/14/13/meet-couple-behind-lagunas-famous-cakes |title=Meet the couple behind Laguna's 'famous cakes' |publisher=ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref> Currently, it is Laguna's richest municipality in terms of assets amounting to Php 652.95 M.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.coa.gov.ph/phocadownload/userupload/Annual-Financial-Report/lgu/2016/2016_AFR_LGUs_Volume_I.pdf | title=2016 Annual Financial Report \u2013 Local Government | volume=1 | date=25 September 2017 | publisher=Republic of the Philippines \u2013 Commission on Audit |  accessdate=10 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Precolonial and Spanish colonial period===\nLos Ba\u00f1os started as a settlement, a barrio of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], called ''Mainit'', the Tagalog term for \"hot\", alluding to the thermal springs at the foot of [[Mount Makiling]]. By 1589, through a Franciscan friar, it became popularly called by its present name, \"Los Ba\u00f1os,\" which is Spanish for \"bathing place\".<ref name=\"losbanosweb.com\">[http://www.losbanosweb.com/history.htm?preloadSite=type+Function&loadingCall=1 ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1595, a temporary building made of bamboo and [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon]] was built to serve as shelter for the patients who journeyed to Mainit to seek cures for their ailments. It was on 17 September 1615 when the friars administered Los Ba\u00f1os as a separate town from Bay.<ref name=\"losbanosweb.com\"/>\n\nIn 1671, more permanent structures like churches and hospitals were built only to be destroyed by a fire in 1727. The structures were re-erected at a slow rate. The church which now stands in the municipal center of Los Ba\u00f1os dates back to 1851. The Spanish Governor's palace was built in 1879 but was only completed in 1892.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=D2rzxiXTG7AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Guide to Los Ba\u00f1os for IRRI International Staff & Families|last=Kirk|first=Kate|publisher=Int.

On 23 February 1945, US forces of the First Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Eleventh Airborne Division led a combined [[Raid at Los Ba\u00f1os|amphibious and airborne raid]] against the prison camp, rescuing over 2,000 Allied nationals. They killed the 250-man Japanese garrison.  In order to force the prisoners to leave behind their belongings and speed up the evacuation before the Japanese could send reinforcements, US forces and Filipino guerrillas burned the camp. Only [[Baker Memorial Hall|Baker Hall]], the university gymnasium until 2010, remained intact.<ref>Bruce Henderson, ''Rescue at Los Ba\u00f1os: The Most Darking Prison Camp Raid of World War II'' (2015)</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1946\u2013present)===\nIn 1959, the [[10th World Scout Jamboree]] was held in Los Ba\u00f1os, with the theme \"Building Tomorrow Today\" with an attendance of 12,203 Scouts.\n\nIn 1962, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) began its operation.\n\nIn 1979, the evolution and development of academic excellence in Los Ba\u00f1os moved the people of Los Ba\u00f1os to request then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to declare the municipality as \"A Special University Zone\", granted on 15 June 1982 by virtue of letter of instruction No. 883.\n\nLos Ba\u00f1os was further declared as an \"Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences Community\" on 17 March 1982 by virtue of Executive Order No. 784 (Section 23).\n\nOn 7 August 2000, Los Ba\u00f1os was declared a ''Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines'' by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 349. It was signed by then President [[Joseph Estrada]]. The Proclamation is in recognition of the town's important contribution in country. The municipality has remained as the country's hub of science and nature with the presence of national and international research institutions collaborating towards the advancement of science research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losbanos.gov.ph/history/page/3|title=The Special Science and Nature City|publisher=Municipality of Los Ba\u00f1os|access-date=17 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229164954/http://losbanos.gov.ph/history/page/3|archive-date=29 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe 6th Flora Malesiana, a triennial gathering of people with botanical expertise regarding \"[[Malesia]],\" was held from 20 to 24 September 2004. It provided a forum for Flora Malesiana members and encouraged publications on Malesian plants.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], Los Ba\u00f1os played host to the aquatics events, with the newly built Trace Aquatic Center at [http://tracecollege.edu.ph/ Trace College] serving as the venue.\n\nThe headquarters of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity was opened on 8 August 2006 at the DENR-Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, located at the College of Forestry, [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]]. It coincided with the foundation day celebrations of the organization. The Philippines assumed the Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006 and played host to the 12th ASEAN and [[East Asia Summit]]s (held in [[Metro Cebu]], January 2007).\n\nIn January 2007, the 5th ASEAN Inter-Club Age-Group Swimming Championships was held in the Trace Aqua Sports Center.\n\nLos Ba\u00f1os also plays host to the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]], as the Trace Aquatics Center has served as the venue for the league's swimming competitions since [[UAAP Season 70]] until [[UAAP Season 76 swimming championships|UAAP Season 76]].\n\nCurrently, Los Ba\u00f1os is probably the densest habitat of academicians in South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://losbanos.gov.ph/facts-and-figures|title=FACTS & FIGURES {{!}} Municipality of Los Banos|website=losbanos.gov.ph|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> Although it is a small town, it has contributed widely through scientific achievements and contributions locally and worldwide particularly on agriculture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n====City hood====\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LakeTadlacjf8660 13.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[Tadlac Lake]]]]\nLos Ba\u00f1os is nestled between two of Southern Luzon's most dominant geographical features \u2013 [[Mount Makiling]] to the south and south-west and [[Laguna de Bay]] to the north.<ref name=\"roadplan\">{{cite map |publisher = Los Ba\u00f1os Municipal Planning and Development Office |title = Plan of Road Network for Municipality of Los Ba\u00f1os, Province of Laguna, Island of Luzon }}</ref> In fact, Laguna de Bay's southernmost tip is at Barangay Bambang, and Barangay Bagong Silang is already halfway up Mount Makiling. Both the mountain and the lake are volcanic features \u2013 Makiling being a potentially active volcano whose geothermal activities gave birth to the hot springs after which the town was named, and Laguna de Bay being the filled-in caldera of a massive prehistoric volcano.\n\nAnother notable geological feature is [[Tadlac Lake]], a [[maar]] lake whose almost perfectly round shape and uncharted waters have led some locals to call it \"the enchanted lake.\" Others call it \"alligator lake\", a reminder that it served as the last bastion of Laguna de Bay's once-plentiful cayman population, which has since been wiped out and is now just another legendary part of Philippine history.\n\n===Rivers===\nThe town of Los Ba\u00f1os is crossed by five rivers or creeks:<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n* The Dampalit river, which is named after an edible herb, ''dampalit'' (''[[Sesuvium portulacastrum]]''), which often grows near river shores, originates on the north face of Mt. Makiling east of the [[Philippine High School for the Arts]], and feeds into Laguna lake at the boundary of Barangays Lalakay and Bambang.<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n* The Saran creek, whose headwaters begin somewhere near the municipal dumpsite, flows through Barangay Anos near the municipal cemetery, and feeds into the lake at Barangay Malinta.\n* The Pele creek, named after the [[pili tree]] (''Canarium ovatum''), flows through the west side of Barangay Batong Malake and has its mouth at the boundary of Barangays Malinta and Mayondon.<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n* The [[Molawin River]], most familiar to UPLB students because it flows through the UPLB campus and the Makiling Botanic Gardens, is named after the Molave tree (''[[Vitex parviflora]]'').\n* The Maitim river, whose name means \"black\", flows through the westernmost portions of Los Ba\u00f1os, marking the town's boundary with its neighboring town of Bay. The Molawin and Maitim rivers merge just a few meters before feeding into Laguna de Bay at the shore of Barangay Maahas.<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nLos Ba\u00f1os has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29.1\n| Feb high C = 30.2\n| Mar high C = 31.9\n| Apr high C = 33.5\n| May high C = 33.6\n| Jun high C = 32.5\n| Jul high C = 31.5\n| Aug high C = 31.2\n| Sep high C = 31.1\n| Oct high C = 31.0\n| Nov high C = 30.2\n| Dec high C = 29.2\n| year high C = 31.3\n| Jan mean C = 25.3\n| Feb mean C = 25.9\n| Mar mean C = 27.1\n| Apr mean C = 28.5\n| May mean C = 28.8\n| Jun mean C = 28.2\n| Jul mean C = 27.5\n| Aug mean C = 27.4\n| Sep mean C = 27.2\n| Oct mean C = 27.1\n| Nov mean C = 26.6\n| Dec mean C = 25.7\n| year mean C = 27.1\n| Jan low C = 21.5\n| Feb low C = 21.6\n| Mar low C = 22.3\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.1\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.6\n| Aug low C = 23.6\n| Sep low C = 23.4\n| Oct low C = 23.3\n| Nov low C = 23.0\n| Dec low C = 22.3\n| year low C = 23.0\n<!--Rainfall-->\n| Jan rain mm = 55\n| Feb rain mm = 27\n| Mar rain mm = 30\n| Apr rain mm = 38\n| May rain mm = 159\n| Jun rain mm = 208\n| Jul rain mm = 280\n| Aug rain mm = 258\n| Sep rain mm = 246\n| Oct rain mm = 252\n| Nov rain mm = 226\n| Dec rain mm = 163\n| year rain mm = 1942\n| source 1 = <ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web|url =http://en.climate-data.org/location/20213/ |title=Climate data for: Los Ba\u00f1os|website=En.climate-data.org| accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Barangays==\nLos Ba\u00f1os is politically subdivided into 14 [[barangay]]s.\n\n[[File:Los Ba\u00f1os.png|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|'''Political map of Los Ba\u00f1os'''}}]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

By 1589, through a Franciscan friar, it became popularly called by its present name, \"Los Ba\u00f1os,\" which is Spanish for \"bathing place.\"<ref name=\"losbanosweb.com\">[http://www.losbanosweb.com/history.htm?preloadSite=type+Function&loadingCall=1 ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1595, a temporary building made of bamboo and cogon was built to serve as shelter for the patients who journeyed to Mainit to seek cures for their ailments. It was on 17 September 1615 when the friars administered Los Ba\u00f1os as a separate town from Bay.<ref name=\"losbanosweb.com\"/>\n\nIn 1671, more permanent structures like churches and hospitals were built only to be destroyed by a fire in 1727. The structures were re-erected at a slow rate. The church which now stands in the municipal center of Los Ba\u00f1os dates back to 1851. The Spanish Governor's palace was built in 1879 but was only completed in 1892.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=D2rzxiXTG7AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Guide to Los Ba\u00f1os for IRRI International Staff & Families|last=Kirk|first=Kate|publisher=Int.

On 23 February 1945, US forces of the First Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Eleventh Airborne Division led a combined [[Raid at Los Ba\u00f1os|amphibious and airborne raid]] against the prison camp, rescuing over 2,000 Allied nationals. They killed the 250-man Japanese garrison.  In order to force the prisoners to leave behind their belongings and speed up the evacuation before the Japanese could send reinforcements, US forces and Filipino guerrillas burned the camp. Only [[Baker Memorial Hall|Baker Hall]], the university gymnasium until 2010, remained intact.<ref>Bruce Henderson, ''Rescue at Los Ba\u00f1os: The Most Darking Prison Camp Raid of World War II'' (2015)</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1946\u2013present)===\nIn 1959, the [[10th World Scout Jamboree]] was held in Los Ba\u00f1os, with the theme \"Building Tomorrow Today\" with an attendance of 12,203 Scouts.\n\nIn 1962, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) began its operation.\n\nIn 1979, the evolution and development of academic excellence in Los Ba\u00f1os moved the people of Los Ba\u00f1os to request then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to declare the municipality as \"A Special University Zone\", granted on 15 June 1982 by virtue of letter of instruction No. 883.\n\nLos Ba\u00f1os was further declared as an \"Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences Community\" on 17 March 1982 by virtue of Executive Order No. 784 (Section 23).\n\nOn 7 August 2000, Los Ba\u00f1os was declared a ''Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines'' by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 349.

Both the mountain and the lake are volcanic features \u2013 Makiling being a potentially active volcano whose geothermal activities gave birth to the hot springs after which the town was named, and Laguna de Bay being the filled-in caldera of a massive prehistoric volcano.\n\nAnother notable geological feature is [[Tadlac Lake]], a [[maar]] lake whose almost perfectly round shape and uncharted waters have led some locals to call it \"the enchanted lake.\" Others call it \"alligator lake\", a reminder that it served as the last bastion of Laguna de Bay's once-plentiful cayman population, which has since been wiped out and is now just another legendary part of Philippine history.\n\n===Rivers===\nThe town of Los Ba\u00f1os is crossed by five rivers or creeks:<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n* The Dampalit river, which is named after an edible herb, ''dampalit'' (''[[Sesuvium portulacastrum]]''), which often grows near river shores, originates on the north face of Mt.

The Molawin and Maitim rivers merge just a few meters before feeding into Laguna de Bay at the shore of Barangay Maahas.<ref name=\"roadplan\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nLos Ba\u00f1os has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29.1\n| Feb high C = 30.2\n| Mar high C = 31.9\n| Apr high C = 33.5\n| May high C = 33.6\n| Jun high C = 32.5\n| Jul high C = 31.5\n| Aug high C = 31.2\n| Sep high C = 31.1\n| Oct high C = 31.0\n| Nov high C = 30.2\n| Dec high C = 29.2\n| year high C = 31.3\n| Jan mean C = 25.3\n| Feb mean C = 25.9\n| Mar mean C = 27.1\n| Apr mean C = 28.5\n| May mean C = 28.8\n| Jun mean C = 28.2\n| Jul mean C = 27.5\n| Aug mean C = 27.4\n| Sep mean C = 27.2\n| Oct mean C = 27.1\n| Nov mean C = 26.6\n| Dec mean C = 25.7\n| year mean C = 27.1\n| Jan low C = 21.5\n| Feb low C = 21.6\n| Mar low C = 22.3\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.1\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.6\n| Aug low C = 23.6\n| Sep low C = 23.4\n| Oct low C = 23.3\n| Nov low C = 23.0\n| Dec low C = 22.3\n| year low C = 23.0\n<!--Rainfall-->\n| Jan rain mm = 55\n| Feb rain mm = 27\n| Mar rain mm = 30\n| Apr rain mm = 38\n| May rain mm = 159\n| Jun rain mm = 208\n| Jul rain mm = 280\n| Aug rain mm = 258\n| Sep rain mm = 246\n| Oct rain mm = 252\n| Nov rain mm = 226\n| Dec rain mm = 163\n| year rain mm = 1942\n| source 1 = <ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web|url =http://en.climate-data.org/location/20213/ |title=Climate data for: Los Ba\u00f1os|website=En.climate-data.org| accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Barangays==\nLos Ba\u00f1os is politically subdivided into 14 [[barangay]]s.\n\n[[File:Los Ba\u00f1os.png|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|'''Political map of Los Ba\u00f1os'''}}]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Church]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. As a Uniate Church, the Syro-Malabar Church continued to employ the [[East Syriac Rite]] liturgy of the Persian Church.<ref name=\"ODCC\">''Addai and Mari, Liturgy of''. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British missionaries led to the formation of the independent Oriental Orthodox [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911,  a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the People who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church . The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church.\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names. At the time of the split, the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\", while the branch that entered into Catholic obedience was designated the ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\". The Portuguese Roman Catholics were not in familiar with the traditions of Eastern Christianity . In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".  Following the association with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the church was often known as the Malankara Syrian Church (Malayalam: \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d30 \u0d38\u0d41\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d38\u0d2d) in reference to their connection to the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac tradition]].\n\n==Early history of Christianity in India==\n[[File:SaintThomasChristian'sDivisionsHistoryFinal-en.svg|alt=|thumb|265x265px|Saint Thomas Christians - Divisions- History in a nutshell]]\nAs a Saint Thomas Christian group, the Malankara Church traced its origins to [[Thomas the Apostle]], said to have proselytized in India in the 1st century.<ref name=Gregorios285/> Different strains of the tradition have him arriving either by sea<ref name=\"T.K.

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates. They gave the Nasranis various rights and privileges which were written on copper plates.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 32 churches(out of 116 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Church]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. As a Uniate Church, the Syro-Malabar Church continued to employ the [[East Syriac Rite]] liturgy of the Persian Church.<ref name=\"ODCC\">''Addai and Mari, Liturgy of''. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British missionaries led to the formation of the independent Oriental Orthodox [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911,  a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the People who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church . The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church.\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names. At the time of the split, the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\", while the branch that entered into Catholic obedience was designated the ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\". The Portuguese Roman Catholics were not in familiar with the traditions of Eastern Christianity . In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates. They gave the Nasranis various rights and privileges which were written on copper plates.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 44 churches(out of 69 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.
