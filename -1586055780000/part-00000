The lower image shows several stars and two white lines.]]\n\n=== Cataloguing ===\nEpsilon Eridani has been known to astronomers since at least the 2nd century AD, when [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (a [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] from [[History of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]) included it in his catalogue of more than a thousand stars. The catalogue was published as part of his astronomical treatise the ''[[Almagest]]''. The constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] was named by Ptolemy ({{lang-grc|\u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd}}, River), and Epsilon Eridani was listed as its thirteenth star. Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani {{lang|grc|\u03cc \u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{lang-for|grc|Greek|a foregoing of the four}} (here {{lang|grc|\u03b4}} is the number four). This refers to a group of four stars in Eridanus: [[Gamma Eridani|\u03b3]], [[Pi Eridani|\u03c0]], [[Delta Eridani|\u03b4]] and \u03b5 (10th\u201313th in Ptolemy's list). \u03b5 is the most western of these, and thus the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west. Modern scholars of Ptolemy's catalogue designate its entry as ''\"P 784\"'' (in order of appearance) and ''\"Eri 13\"''. Ptolemy described the star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] as 3.{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2012}}\n\nEpsilon Eridani was included in several star catalogues of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic]] astronomical treatises, which were based on Ptolemy's catalogue: in [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi|Al-Sufi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'', published in 964, [[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b|Al-Biruni]]'s ''Mas'ud Canon'', published in 1030, and [[Ulugh Beg]]'s ''[[Zij-i Sultani]]'', published in 1437. Al-Sufi's estimate of Epsilon Eridani's magnitude was 3. Al-Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al-Sufi (for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy's and Al-Sufi's magnitudes; original values of both these magnitudes are 3). Its number in order of appearance is 786.{{r|Al-Biruni1030}} Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani's coordinates in [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|his observatory]] at [[Samarkand]], and quotes magnitudes from Al-Sufi (3 for Epsilon Eridani). The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg's catalogue are ''\"U 781\"'' and ''\"Eri 13\"'' (the latter is the same as Ptolemy's catalogue designation).{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2012}}\n\nIn 1598 Epsilon Eridani was included in [[Tycho Brahe]]'s star catalogue, republished in 1627 by [[Johannes Kepler]] as part of his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. This catalogue was based on Tycho Brahe's observations of 1577\u20131597, including those on the island of [[Hven]] at his observatories of [[Uraniborg]] and [[Stjerneborg]]. The sequence number of Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus was 10, and it was designated {{lang|la|Quae omnes quatuor antecedit}}, {{Langnf||Latin|which precedes all four}}; the meaning is the same as Ptolemy's description. Brahe assigned it magnitude 3.{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2010a}}\n\nEpsilon Eridani's [[Bayer designation]] was established in 1603 as part of the ''[[Uranometria]]'', a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]. His catalogue assigned letters from the [[Greek alphabet]] to groups of stars belonging to the same visual magnitude class in each constellation, beginning with alpha (\u03b1) for a star in the brightest class. Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness within each class. Thus, although Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet,<ref name=jha17_50_189 /> the star is the [[List of stars in Eridanus|tenth-brightest in Eridanus]].<ref name=ybsc1991 /> In addition to the letter \u03b5, Bayer had given it the number 13 (the same as Ptolemy's catalogue number, as were many of Bayer's numbers) and described it as {{lang|la|Decima septima}}, {{lang-for||Latin|the seventeenth}}.{{#tag:ref|This is because Bayer designated 21 stars in the northern part of Eridanus by preceding along the 'river' from east to west, starting from \u03b2 ({{lang|la|Supra pedem Orionis in flumine, prima}}, meaning ''above [[Rigel|the foot]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the river, the first'') to the twenty-first, \u03c3 ({{lang|la|Vigesima prima}}, that is ''the twenty-first''). Epsilon Eridani was the seventeenth in this sequence. These 21 stars are: \u03b2, \u03bb, \u03c8, b, \u03c9, \u03bc, c, \u03bd, \u03be, \u03bf (two stars), d, A, \u03b3, \u03c0, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03c1, \u03b7, \u03c3.<ref name=\"Bayer1603\" />|group=note|name=bayer}} Bayer assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Bayer1603}}\n\nIn 1690 Epsilon Eridani was included in the star catalogue of [[Johannes Hevelius]].

It contains three observations of Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=lalande group=note>1796 September 17 (page 246), 1796 December 3 (page 248) and 1797 November 13 (page 307)</ref>{{r|Lalande1801}} In 1847, a new edition of Lalande's catalogue was published by Francis Baily, containing the majority of its observations, in which the stars were numbered in order of [[right ascension]]. Because every observation of each star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times, it got three numbers: 6581, 6582 and 6583.{{r|Baily1847}} (Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix \"Lalande\", or \"Lal\".{{r|Lal}}) Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Lalande1801|Baily1847}} Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of [[Johann Bode]], in which about 17,000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered (Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus). Bode's catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers, including Bode himself, but mostly on Lalande's and Lacaille's (for the southern sky). Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Bode1801}} In 1814 [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] published the second edition of his star catalogue (its first edition was published in 1803), based on observations during 1792\u20131813, in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours (0\u201323). Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3. Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4.{{r|Piazzi1814}} In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] with the designation HD&nbsp;22049 and a preliminary spectral classification of K0.<ref name=ahco91_1 />\n\n=== Detection of proximity ===\nBased on observations between 1800 and 1880, Epsilon Eridani was found to have a large [[proper motion]] across the [[celestial sphere]], which was estimated at three [[arcsecond]]s per year ([[angular velocity]]).<ref name=mras48_77 /> This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun,<ref name=belkora2002 /> making it a star of interest for the purpose of [[stellar parallax]] measurements. This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun, which allows a star's distance to be estimated.<ref name=mras48_77 /> From 1881 to 1883, American astronomer [[William Lewis Elkin|William L. Elkin]] used a [[heliometer]] at the [[Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope]], South Africa, to compare the position of Epsilon Eridani with two nearby stars. From these observations, a parallax of {{nowrap|0.14 \u00b1 0.02 arcseconds}} was calculated.<ref name=gill1893 /><ref name=gill1884 /> By 1917, observers had refined their parallax estimate to 0.317&nbsp;arcseconds.<ref name=apj46_313 /> The modern value of 0.3109&nbsp;arcseconds is equivalent to a distance of about {{convert|10.50|ly|pc}}.<ref name=aaa474_2_653 />\n\n=== Circumstellar discoveries ===\nBased on apparent changes in the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, [[Peter van de Kamp]] proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25&nbsp;years was causing gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] in its position.<ref name=aj79_491 /> This claim was refuted in 1993 by [[Wulff-Dieter Heintz]] and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the [[photographic plate]]s.<ref name=aj105_3_1188 />\n\nLaunched in 1983, the [[space telescope]] [[IRAS]] detected [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] emissions from stars near to the Sun,<ref name=apj278_L1 /> including an [[infrared excess|excess infrared emission]] from Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=pasp97_885 /> The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained [[cosmic dust]] was orbiting the star;<ref name=pasp97_885 /> this [[debris disk]] has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution could be explained by gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.<ref name=apj506_2_L133 />\n\nIn 1987, the detection of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang.<ref name=hesser1987 /><ref name=Campbell1988 /> From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by [[Artie P.

They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years.<ref name=apj544_2_L145 /> Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its [[photosphere]],<ref name=iau202 /> any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in [[emission line]]s of ionized calcium (the [[Calcium#H and K lines|Ca II H and K lines]]). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause.<ref name=apj133_6_2442 /> This discovery was supported by [[astrometric]] measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], which showed evidence for [[gravitational perturbation]] of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.<ref name=aj132_2206 />\n\nAstrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student [[Stephen Thorndike]] performed computer simulations of the structure of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani. Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could be explained by the presence of a second planet in an eccentric orbit, which they announced in 2002.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 />\n\n=== SETI and proposed exploration ===\nIn 1960, physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] proposed that [[extraterrestrial civilisations]] might be using radio signals for communication.<ref name=gugliucci20100524 /> [[Project Ozma]], led by astronomer [[Frank Drake]], used the [[Tatel Telescope]] to search for such signals from the nearby [[Solar-type star|Sun-like stars]] Epsilon Eridani and [[Tau Ceti]]. The systems were observed at the [[Hydrogen line|emission frequency of neutral hydrogen]], 1,420&nbsp;MHz (21&nbsp;cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected.<ref name=heidmann_dunlop1995 /> Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result.<ref name=gugliucci20100524 /> Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into [[Epsilon Eridani in fiction|science fiction literature and television shows]] for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.<ref name=marschall_maran2009 />\n\nIn ''Habitable Planets for Man'', a 1964 [[RAND Corporation]] study by space scientist Stephen H. Dole, the probability of a [[habitable planet]] being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3.3%. Among the known nearby stars, it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a habitable planet.<ref name=dole1964 />\n\n[[William I. McLaughlin]] proposed a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as [[nova]] explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in 1988, which used outbursts of [[Nova Cygni 1975]] as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=baas20_1043 />\n\nBecause of the proximity and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author [[Robert L.

Only to the north of [[80th parallel north|latitude 80\u00b0&nbsp;N]] is it permanently hidden below the horizon.<ref name=campbell1899 /> The [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by [[light pollution]].<ref name=narisada2004 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani has an estimated mass of 0.82 [[solar mass]]es<ref name=mnras403_3_1368 /><ref name=Baines /> and a radius of 0.74 [[solar radius|solar radii]].<ref name=aaa505_1_205 /> It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].<ref name=apj460_993 /> The estimated [[effective temperature]] is 5,084&nbsp;K.<ref name=aaa411_3_559 /> With a stellar classification of K2&nbsp;V, it is the second-nearest [[K-type main-sequence star]] (after [[Alpha Centauri]] B).<ref name=RECONS /> Since 1943 the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of Epsilon Eridani has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.<ref name=baas25_1319 /> Its [[metallicity]], the fraction of elements heavier than [[helium]], is slightly lower than the Sun's.<ref name=aaa415 /> In Epsilon Eridani's [[chromosphere]], a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting [[photosphere]], the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value.<ref name=aaa415 /> The proportion of [[lithium]] in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.<ref name=Metcalfe2013 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani's K-type classification indicates that the spectrum has relatively weak [[absorption line]]s from absorption by hydrogen ([[Balmer lines]]) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly [[ion]]ized [[Calcium#H and K lines|calcium]] (Ca II). The [[luminosity class]] V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing [[thermonuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion is dominated by the [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]], in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through [[radiative transfer|radiation]], which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by [[Convection zone|plasma convection]], where it then radiates into space.<ref name=karttunen_oja2007 />\n\n=== Magnetic activity ===\n\nEpsilon Eridani has a higher level of [[Stellar magnetic field|magnetic activity]] than the Sun, and thus the outer parts of its atmosphere (the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar corona|corona]]) are more dynamic.

This results in greater [[jitter]] during [[Doppler spectroscopy|measurements of its radial velocity]]. Variations of {{nowrap|15 m s}}<sup>\u22121</sup> were measured over a 20&nbsp;year period, which is much higher than the [[measurement uncertainty]] of {{nowrap|3 m s}}<sup>\u22121</sup>. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.<ref name=iau202 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani is classified as a [[BY Draconis variable]] because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out of the line of sight as it rotates.<ref name=gcvs /> Measurement of this [[rotational modulation]] suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2&nbsp;days,<ref name=an328_10 /> which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to [[starspot]]s and other short-term magnetic activity.<ref name=apj102_5_1813 /> [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing [[differential rotation]] i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high [[latitude]]. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days.<ref name=apj441 /><ref name=rotation group=note /> The [[axial tilt]] of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24\u00b0 to 72\u00b0.<ref name=an328_10 />\n\nThe high levels of chromospheric activity, strong magnetic field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star.<ref name=apj1_412_2_797 /> Most estimates of the age of Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /> The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the [[interstellar medium]] (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars.<ref name=aaa358_850 /> This anomaly might be caused by a [[diffusion]] process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's [[convection zone]].<ref name=cjaa8_5_591 />\n\nThe [[X-ray]] luminosity of Epsilon Eridani is about {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 10<sup>28</sup> [[erg]]s/s}} ({{nowrap|2 \u00d7 10<sup>21</sup> [[Watt|W]]}}). It is more luminous in X-rays than the Sun at [[Solar cycle|peak activity]]. The source for this strong X-ray emission is Epsilon Eridani's hot corona.<ref name=apj243_234 /><ref name=apj457_882 /> Epsilon Eridani's corona appears larger and hotter than the Sun's, with a temperature of {{nowrap|3.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> K}}, measured from observation of the corona's ultraviolet and X-ray emission.<ref name=mnras385_4_1691 />\n\nThe [[stellar wind]] emitted by Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the surrounding [[interstellar medium]] of diffuse gas and dust, resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas (an [[astrosphere]], the equivalent of the [[heliosphere]] that surrounds the Sun). The [[absorption spectrum]] from this gas has been measured with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated.<ref name=mnras385_4_1691 /> Epsilon Eridani's hot corona results in a mass loss rate in Epsilon Eridani's stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun's. This stellar wind generates the astrosphere that spans about {{convert|8000|au|pc|abbr=on}} and contains a [[bow shock]] that lies {{convert|1600|au|pc|abbr=on}} from Epsilon Eridani. At its estimated distance from Earth, this astrosphere spans 42&nbsp;arcminutes, which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon.<ref name=apj574_1 />\n\n=== Kinematics ===\nEpsilon Eridani has a high [[proper motion]], moving \u22120.976&nbsp;arcseconds per year in [[right ascension]] (the celestial equivalent of longitude) and 0.018&nbsp;arcseconds per year in [[declination]] (celestial latitude), for a combined total of 0.962 arcseconds per year.<ref name=aaa474_2_653 />{{refn|1=The total proper motion \u03bc can be computed from:\n: \u03bc<sup>2</sup> = (\u03bc<sub>\u03b1</sub> cos \u03b4)<sup>2</sup> + \u03bc<sub>\u03b4</sub><sup>2</sup>\nwhere \u03bc<sub>\u03b1</sub> is the proper motion in right ascension, \u03bc<sub>\u03b4</sub> is the proper motion in declination, and \u03b4 is the declination.<ref name=\"birney\" /> This yields:\n: \u03bc<sup>2</sup> = (\u2212975.17 \u00b7 cos(\u22129.458\u00b0))<sup>2</sup> + 19.49<sup>2</sup> = 925658.1\nor \u03bc equals 962.11.|group=\"note\"|name=total_pm}} The star has a radial velocity of {{convert|+15.5|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} (away from the Sun).<ref name=rgcrv66 /> The [[space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]] components of Epsilon Eridani in the [[galactic coordinate system|galactic co-ordinate system]] are {{nowrap|(U, V, W)}} = {{nowrap|(\u22123, +7, \u221220) km/s}}, which means that it is travelling within the [[Milky Way]] at a mean [[galactocentric distance]] of 28.7&nbsp;kly (8.79&nbsp;kiloparsecs) from the core along an orbit that has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.09.<ref name=ab6_2_308 /> The [[Stellar kinematics|velocity and heading]] of Epsilon Eridani indicate that it may be a member of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], whose members share a common motion through space. This behaviour suggests that the moving group originated in an [[open cluster]] that has since diffused.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /><ref name=an325_1_3 /> The estimated age of this group is {{nowrap|500\u00b1100 million}} years,<ref name=apj125_4_1980 /> which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani.\n\nDuring the past million years, three stars are believed to have come within {{convert|7|ly|pc|abbr=on}} of Epsilon Eridani. The most recent and closest of these encounters was with [[Kapteyn's Star]], which approached to a distance of about {{convert|3|ly|pc|abbr=on}} roughly 12,500 years ago. Two more distant encounters were with [[Sirius]] and [[Ross 614]]. None of these encounters are thought to have been close enough to affect the circumstellar disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=asp2001_227 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani made its closest approach to the Sun about 105,000&nbsp;years ago, when they were separated by {{convert|7|ly|pc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=aaa379 /> Based upon a simulation of close encounters with nearby stars, the binary star system [[Luyten 726-8]], which includes the [[variable star]] [[UV Ceti]], will encounter Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years at a minimum distance of about 0.9&nbsp;ly (0.29&nbsp;parsecs). They will be less than 1&nbsp;ly (0.3&nbsp;parsecs) apart for about 4,600 years.

The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18&nbsp;arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60&nbsp;AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35\u201375 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30&nbsp;AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's [[Kuiper belt]]: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25\u00b0 to the line of sight.<ref name=apj506_2_L133 />\n\nDust and possibly water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a process by which stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the [[Poynting\u2013Robertson effect]].<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 /> At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale for all of the dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.<ref name=apj690_2_1522 />\n\nThe disk contains an estimated mass of dust equal to a sixth of the mass of the Moon, with individual dust grains exceeding 3.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in size at a temperature of about 55&nbsp;K. This dust is being generated by the collision of comets, which range up to 10 to 30&nbsp;km in diameter and have a combined mass of 5 to 9 times that of Earth. This is similar to the estimated 10 Earth masses in the primordial Kuiper belt.<ref name=apj619_2_L187 /><ref name=emp92_1_1 /> The disk around Epsilon Eridani contains less than {{nowrap|2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>17</sup> kg}} of [[carbon monoxide]]. This low level suggests a paucity of volatile-bearing comets and icy [[planetesimal]]s compared to the Kuiper belt.<ref name=mnras348_3_L39 />\n\nThe clumpy structure of the dust belt may be explained by gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]].<ref name=apjl_537_L147 /> In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an [[orbital eccentricity]] of about 0.3.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 /> Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between [[minor planet]]s known as [[plutino]]s.<ref name=aj140_4_1007 />\n\nObservations from NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] suggest that Epsilon Eridani actually has two asteroid belts and a cloud of [[exozodiacal dust]]. The latter is an analogue of the [[zodiacal dust]] that occupies the plane of the [[Solar System]]. One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System, orbiting at a distance of {{nowrap|3.00 \u00b1 0.75 AU}} from Epsilon Eridani, and consists of [[silicate]] grains with a diameter of 3&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u03bcm]] and a combined mass of about 10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;kg. If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet, so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as [[asteroid]]s.<ref name=aaa499_2_L13 /> The second, denser belt, most likely also populated by asteroids, lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk. The structure of the belts and the dust disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration.<ref name=apj690_2_1522 /><ref name=spitzer20081027 />\n\nIn an alternative scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90&nbsp;AU from Epsilon Eridani and has an assumed mass of 10<sup>\u22123</sup> times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], located beyond 10&nbsp;AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100&nbsp;K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and [[silicate]] dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack [[volatiles]].<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 />\n\nThe inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a radius of 2.5&nbsp;AU inward, appears to be clear of dust down to the detection limit of the 6.5&nbsp;m [[MMT Observatory|MMT telescope]]. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while the presence of a planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.<ref name=apj693_2_1500 />\n\n=== Possible planets ===\n[[File:NASA-JPL-Caltech - Double the Rubble (PIA11375) (pd).jpg|right|thumb|Artist's impression, showing two asteroid belts and a planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani|alt=A bright light source at right is encircled by comets and two oval belts of debris.

Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30\u201335&nbsp;AU.<ref name=\"Janson2015\" />\n\n==== Planet b ====\n{{further|Epsilon Eridani b}}\n[[Extrasolar planet#Nomenclature|Referred to]] as [[Epsilon Eridani b|Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b]], this planet was announced in 2000, but the discovery has remained controversial. A comprehensive study in 2008 called the detection \"tentative\" and described the proposed planet as \"long suspected but still unconfirmed\".<ref name=apj690_2_1522 /> Many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /><ref name=arxiv1011_4882 /><ref name=aaa499_2_L13 /><ref name=apj688_1_583 /> As of 2013, the discovery remains in doubt because a search program at [[La Silla Observatory]] did not confirm it exists.<ref name=\"aa552_A78_62\" />\n\n[[File:Epsilon Eridani b.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of the proposed planet Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b orbiting within a zone that has been cleared of dust.

Values for its orbital period range from 6.85 to 7.2 years.<ref name=aj132_2206 /> Estimates of the size of its elliptical orbit\u2014the [[semimajor axis]]\u2014range from 3.38 AU to 3.50 AU<ref name=cne2008 /><ref name=apj646_505 /> and approximations of its [[orbital eccentricity]] range from {{nowrap|0.25 \u00b1 0.23}} to {{nowrap|0.702 \u00b1 0.039}}.<ref name=aj132_2206 /><ref name=apj646_505 />\n\nThe true mass of this planet remains unknown, but it can be estimated based on the displacement effect of the planet's gravity on Epsilon Eridani. Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth is known, which yields a value for the formula [[Stellar rotation#Measurement|''m''&nbsp;sin&nbsp;''i'']], where ''m'' is the mass of the planet and ''i'' is the [[orbital inclination]]. Estimates for the value of {{nowrap|''m'' sin ''i''}} range from 0.60 [[Jupiter mass]]es to 1.06 Jupiter masses,<ref name=cne2008 /><ref name=apj646_505 /> which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet (because the [[sine]] function has a maximum value of 1). Taking {{nowrap|''m'' sin ''i''}} in the middle of that range at 0.78, and estimating the inclination at 30\u00b0, this yields the frequently cited value of {{nowrap|1.55 \u00b1 0.24}} Jupiter masses for the planet's mass.<ref name=aj132_2206 />\n\nOf all the measured parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity is the most uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b's eccentricity is inconsistent with the presence of the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3&nbsp;AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b's eccentricity of about 0.10\u20130.15.<ref name=aaa499_2_L13 /><ref name=spitzer20081027 /> If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 />\n\n==== Planet c ====\n[[File:View epsilon eridani c.png|right|thumb|Artist's impression of the unconfirmed second planet as seen from a hypothetical moon.

Along the bottom is the rugged terrain of a moon surface.]]\nComputer simulations of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani suggest that the shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;c. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have [[Orbital resonance|resonant]] orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;c would orbit at a distance of 40&nbsp;AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 /> The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /> Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10&nbsp;AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.<ref name=mnras347_2_613 />\n\n==== Potential habitability ====\nEpsilon Eridani is a target for planet finding programs because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]], it was a target star for NASA's proposed [[Space Interferometry Mission]] to search for Earth-sized planets.<ref name=mccarcty2008 /> The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an [[interstellar probe]] can be sent to Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=jsr22_345 /><ref name=jbis29_94 /><ref name=mcnutt2000 />\n\nThe orbital radius at which the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the [[solar constant]]\u2014where the emission matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth\u2014is 0.61 astronomical units (AU).<ref name=aaa511 /> That is within the maximum [[habitable zone]] of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0&nbsp;AU.

Upon its discovery, the planet was designated Epsilon Eridani b, following the usual [[exoplanet naming convention|designation system for extrasolar planets]].\n\nThe planet and its host star were selected by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as part of a competition for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, for some systems that did not already have proper names.<ref name=nameexoworlds /><ref name=the_exoworlds /> The process involved nominations by educational groups and public voting for the proposed names.<ref name=exoworlds_process /> In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were ''Ran'' for the star and ''AEgir'' {{sic}} for the planet.<ref name=iau_results /> Those names had been submitted by the pupils of the [[School grades (US)|8th Grade]] at Mountainside Middle School in [[Colbert, Washington]], United States.

The lower image shows several stars and two white lines.]]\n\n=== Cataloguing ===\nEpsilon Eridani has been known to astronomers since at least the 2nd century AD, when [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (a [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] from [[History of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]) included it in his catalogue of more than a thousand stars. The catalogue was published as part of his astronomical treatise the ''[[Almagest]]''. The constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] was named by Ptolemy ({{lang-grc|\u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd}}, River), and Epsilon Eridani was listed as its thirteenth star. Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani {{lang|grc|\u03cc \u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{lang-for|grc|Greek|a foregoing of the four}} (here {{lang|grc|\u03b4}} is the number four). This refers to a group of four stars in Eridanus: [[Gamma Eridani|\u03b3]], [[Pi Eridani|\u03c0]], [[Delta Eridani|\u03b4]] and \u03b5 (10th\u201313th in Ptolemy's list). \u03b5 is the most western of these, and thus the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west. Modern scholars of Ptolemy's catalogue designate its entry as ''\"P 784\"'' (in order of appearance) and ''\"Eri 13\"''. Ptolemy described the star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] as 3.{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2012}}\n\nEpsilon Eridani was included in several star catalogues of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic]] astronomical treatises, which were based on Ptolemy's catalogue: in [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi|Al-Sufi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'', published in 964, [[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b|Al-Biruni]]'s ''Mas'ud Canon'', published in 1030, and [[Ulugh Beg]]'s ''[[Zij-i Sultani]]'', published in 1437. Al-Sufi's estimate of Epsilon Eridani's magnitude was 3. Al-Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al-Sufi (for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy's and Al-Sufi's magnitudes; original values of both these magnitudes are 3). Its number in order of appearance is 786.{{r|Al-Biruni1030}} Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani's coordinates in [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|his observatory]] at [[Samarkand]], and quotes magnitudes from Al-Sufi (3 for Epsilon Eridani). The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg's catalogue are ''\"U 781\"'' and ''\"Eri 13\"'' (the latter is the same as Ptolemy's catalogue designation).{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2012}}\n\nIn 1598 Epsilon Eridani was included in [[Tycho Brahe]]'s star catalogue, republished in 1627 by [[Johannes Kepler]] as part of his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. This catalogue was based on Tycho Brahe's observations of 1577\u20131597, including those on the island of [[Hven]] at his observatories of [[Uraniborg]] and [[Stjerneborg]]. The sequence number of Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus was 10, and it was designated {{lang|la|Quae omnes quatuor antecedit}}, {{Langnf||Latin|which precedes all four}}; the meaning is the same as Ptolemy's description. Brahe assigned it magnitude 3.{{r|Baily1843|Verbunt2010a}}\n\nEpsilon Eridani's [[Bayer designation]] was established in 1603 as part of the ''[[Uranometria]]'', a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]. His catalogue assigned letters from the [[Greek alphabet]] to groups of stars belonging to the same visual magnitude class in each constellation, beginning with alpha (\u03b1) for a star in the brightest class. Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness within each class. Thus, although Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet,<ref name=jha17_50_189 /> the star is the [[List of stars in Eridanus|tenth-brightest in Eridanus]].<ref name=ybsc1991 /> In addition to the letter \u03b5, Bayer had given it the number 13 (the same as Ptolemy's catalogue number, as were many of Bayer's numbers) and described it as {{lang|la|Decima septima}}, {{lang-for||Latin|the seventeenth}}.{{#tag:ref|This is because Bayer designated 21 stars in the northern part of Eridanus by preceding along the 'river' from east to west, starting from \u03b2 ({{lang|la|Supra pedem Orionis in flumine, prima}}, meaning ''above [[Rigel|the foot]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the river, the first'') to the twenty-first, \u03c3 ({{lang|la|Vigesima prima}}, that is ''the twenty-first''). Epsilon Eridani was the seventeenth in this sequence. These 21 stars are: \u03b2, \u03bb, \u03c8, b, \u03c9, \u03bc, c, \u03bd, \u03be, \u03bf (two stars), d, A, \u03b3, \u03c0, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03c1, \u03b7, \u03c3.<ref name=\"Bayer1603\" />|group=note|name=bayer}} Bayer assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Bayer1603}}\n\nIn 1690 Epsilon Eridani was included in the star catalogue of [[Johannes Hevelius]].

Because every observation of each star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times, it got three numbers: 6581, 6582 and 6583.{{r|Baily1847}} (Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix \"Lalande\", or \"Lal\".{{r|Lal}}) Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Lalande1801|Baily1847}} Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of [[Johann Bode]], in which about 17,000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered (Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus). Bode's catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers, including Bode himself, but mostly on Lalande's and Lacaille's (for the southern sky). Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.{{r|Bode1801}} In 1814 [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] published the second edition of his star catalogue (its first edition was published in 1803), based on observations during 1792\u20131813, in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours (0\u201323). Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3. Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4.{{r|Piazzi1814}} In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] with the designation HD&nbsp;22049 and a preliminary spectral classification of K0.<ref name=ahco91_1 />\n\n=== Detection of proximity ===\nBased on observations between 1800 and 1880, Epsilon Eridani was found to have a large [[proper motion]] across the [[celestial sphere]], which was estimated at three [[arcsecond]]s per year ([[angular velocity]]).<ref name=mras48_77 /> This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun,<ref name=belkora2002 /> making it a star of interest for the purpose of [[stellar parallax]] measurements. This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun, which allows a star's distance to be estimated.<ref name=mras48_77 /> From 1881 to 1883, American astronomer [[William Lewis Elkin|William L.

From these observations, a parallax of {{nowrap|0.14 \u00b1 0.02 arcseconds}} was calculated.<ref name=gill1893 /><ref name=gill1884 /> By 1917, observers had refined their parallax estimate to 0.317&nbsp;arcseconds.<ref name=apj46_313 /> The modern value of 0.3109&nbsp;arcseconds is equivalent to a distance of about {{convert|10.50|ly|pc}}.<ref name=aaa474_2_653 />\n\n=== Circumstellar discoveries ===\nBased on apparent changes in the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, [[Peter van de Kamp]] proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25&nbsp;years was causing gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] in its position.<ref name=aj79_491 /> This claim was refuted in 1993 by [[Wulff-Dieter Heintz]] and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the [[photographic plate]]s.<ref name=aj105_3_1188 />\n\nLaunched in 1983, the [[space telescope]] [[IRAS]] detected [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] emissions from stars near to the Sun,<ref name=apj278_L1 /> including an [[infrared excess|excess infrared emission]] from Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=pasp97_885 /> The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained [[cosmic dust]] was orbiting the star;<ref name=pasp97_885 /> this [[debris disk]] has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution could be explained by gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.<ref name=apj506_2_L133 />\n\nIn 1987, the detection of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang.<ref name=hesser1987 /><ref name=Campbell1988 /> From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by [[Artie P. Hatzes]] made [[radial velocity]] observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler shift of the star along the line of sight]]. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years.<ref name=apj544_2_L145 /> Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its [[photosphere]],<ref name=iau202 /> any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in [[emission line]]s of ionized calcium (the [[Calcium#H and K lines|Ca II H and K lines]]). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause.<ref name=apj133_6_2442 /> This discovery was supported by [[astrometric]] measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], which showed evidence for [[gravitational perturbation]] of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.<ref name=aj132_2206 />\n\nAstrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student [[Stephen Thorndike]] performed computer simulations of the structure of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani. Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could be explained by the presence of a second planet in an eccentric orbit, which they announced in 2002.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 />\n\n=== SETI and proposed exploration ===\nIn 1960, physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] proposed that [[extraterrestrial civilisations]] might be using radio signals for communication.<ref name=gugliucci20100524 /> [[Project Ozma]], led by astronomer [[Frank Drake]], used the [[Tatel Telescope]] to search for such signals from the nearby [[Solar-type star|Sun-like stars]] Epsilon Eridani and [[Tau Ceti]]. The systems were observed at the [[Hydrogen line|emission frequency of neutral hydrogen]], 1,420&nbsp;MHz (21&nbsp;cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected.<ref name=heidmann_dunlop1995 /> Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result.<ref name=gugliucci20100524 /> Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into [[Epsilon Eridani in fiction|science fiction literature and television shows]] for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.<ref name=marschall_maran2009 />\n\nIn ''Habitable Planets for Man'', a 1964 [[RAND Corporation]] study by space scientist Stephen H. Dole, the probability of a [[habitable planet]] being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3.3%. Among the known nearby stars, it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a habitable planet.<ref name=dole1964 />\n\n[[William I. McLaughlin]] proposed a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as [[nova]] explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in 1988, which used outbursts of [[Nova Cygni 1975]] as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=baas20_1043 />\n\nBecause of the proximity and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author [[Robert L. Forward]] considered the system as a plausible target for [[interstellar travel]].<ref name=jsr22_345 /> The following year, the [[British Interplanetary Society]] suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of the targets in its [[Project Daedalus]] study.<ref name=jbis29_94 /> The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals, such as [[Project Icarus (Interstellar Probe Design Study)|Project Icarus]] in 2011.<ref name=aa20110125 />\n\nBased on its nearby location, Epsilon Eridani was among the target stars for [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]], a 1995 [[microwave]] survey for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence.<ref name=henry_asp19930916 /> The project had checked about 800 stars by 2004 but had not yet detected any signals.<ref name=whitehouse_bbc20040325 />\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:Size epsilon eridani.png|left|thumb|Illustration of the relative sizes of Epsilon Eridani (left) and the Sun (right)|alt=A glowing orange orb on the left half and a slightly larger glowing yellow orb on the right against a black background]]\n\nAt a distance of {{convert|10.50|ly|pc|abbr=in}}, Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or [[stellar system]]) to the Sun as of 2014.<ref name=RECONS /> Its proximity makes it one of the most studied stars of its [[stellar classification|spectral type]].<ref name=mnras398_3_1495 /> Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3\u00b0 east of the slightly brighter star [[Delta Eridani]]. With a declination of \u22129.46\u00b0, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of [[80th parallel north|latitude 80\u00b0&nbsp;N]] is it permanently hidden below the horizon.<ref name=campbell1899 /> The [[apparent magnitude]] of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by [[light pollution]].<ref name=narisada2004 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani has an estimated mass of 0.82 [[solar mass]]es<ref name=mnras403_3_1368 /><ref name=Baines /> and a radius of 0.74 [[solar radius|solar radii]].<ref name=aaa505_1_205 /> It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].<ref name=apj460_993 /> The estimated [[effective temperature]] is 5,084&nbsp;K.<ref name=aaa411_3_559 /> With a stellar classification of K2&nbsp;V, it is the second-nearest [[K-type main-sequence star]] (after [[Alpha Centauri]] B).<ref name=RECONS /> Since 1943 the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of Epsilon Eridani has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.<ref name=baas25_1319 /> Its [[metallicity]], the fraction of elements heavier than [[helium]], is slightly lower than the Sun's.<ref name=aaa415 /> In Epsilon Eridani's [[chromosphere]], a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting [[photosphere]], the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value.<ref name=aaa415 /> The proportion of [[lithium]] in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.<ref name=Metcalfe2013 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani's K-type classification indicates that the spectrum has relatively weak [[absorption line]]s from absorption by hydrogen ([[Balmer lines]]) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly [[ion]]ized [[Calcium#H and K lines|calcium]] (Ca II). The [[luminosity class]] V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing [[thermonuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion is dominated by the [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]], in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through [[radiative transfer|radiation]], which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by [[Convection zone|plasma convection]], where it then radiates into space.<ref name=karttunen_oja2007 />\n\n=== Magnetic activity ===\n\nEpsilon Eridani has a higher level of [[Stellar magnetic field|magnetic activity]] than the Sun, and thus the outer parts of its atmosphere (the [[chromosphere]] and [[corona]]) are more dynamic. The average magnetic field strength of Epsilon Eridani across the entire surface is {{nowrap|(1.65 \u00b1 0.30) \u00d7 10<sup>\u22122</sup> [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]}},<ref name=aaa318_429 /> which is more than forty times greater than the {{nowrap|(5\u201340) \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup> T}} magnetic-field strength in the Sun's photosphere.<ref name=apj591_2_1248 /> The magnetic properties can be modelled by assuming that regions with a [[magnetic flux]] of about 0.14&nbsp;T randomly cover approximately 9% of the photosphere, whereas the remainder of the surface is free of magnetic fields.<ref name=apj1_439_2_939 /> The overall magnetic activity of Epsilon Eridani shows co-existing {{Val|2.95|0.03}} and {{Val|12.7|0.3}} year activity cycles.<ref name=Metcalfe2013 /> Assuming that its radius does not change over these intervals, the long-term variation in activity level appears to produce a temperature variation of 15 K, which corresponds to a variation in [[UBV photometric system|visual magnitude]] (V) of 0.014.<ref name=apj441 />\n\nThe magnetic field on the surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the [[hydrodynamic]] behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater [[jitter]] during [[Doppler spectroscopy|measurements of its radial velocity]]. Variations of {{nowrap|15 m s}}<sup>\u22121</sup> were measured over a 20&nbsp;year period, which is much higher than the [[measurement uncertainty]] of {{nowrap|3 m s}}<sup>\u22121</sup>. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.<ref name=iau202 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani is classified as a [[BY Draconis variable]] because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out of the line of sight as it rotates.<ref name=gcvs /> Measurement of this [[rotational modulation]] suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2&nbsp;days,<ref name=an328_10 /> which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to [[starspot]]s and other short-term magnetic activity.<ref name=apj102_5_1813 /> [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing [[differential rotation]] i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high [[latitude]]. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days.<ref name=apj441 /><ref name=rotation group=note /> The [[axial tilt]] of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24\u00b0 to 72\u00b0.<ref name=an328_10 />\n\nThe high levels of chromospheric activity, strong magnetic field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star.<ref name=apj1_412_2_797 /> Most estimates of the age of Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /> The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the [[interstellar medium]] (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars.<ref name=aaa358_850 /> This anomaly might be caused by a [[diffusion]] process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's [[convection zone]].<ref name=cjaa8_5_591 />\n\nThe [[X-ray]] luminosity of Epsilon Eridani is about {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 10<sup>28</sup> [[erg]]s/s}} ({{nowrap|2 \u00d7 10<sup>21</sup> [[Watt|W]]}}). It is more luminous in X-rays than the Sun at [[Solar cycle|peak activity]]. The source for this strong X-ray emission is Epsilon Eridani's hot corona.<ref name=apj243_234 /><ref name=apj457_882 /> Epsilon Eridani's corona appears larger and hotter than the Sun's, with a temperature of {{nowrap|3.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> K}}, measured from observation of the corona's ultraviolet and X-ray emission.<ref name=mnras385_4_1691 />\n\nThe [[stellar wind]] emitted by Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the surrounding [[interstellar medium]] of diffuse gas and dust, resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas (an [[astrosphere]], the equivalent of the [[heliosphere]] that surrounds the Sun). The [[absorption spectrum]] from this gas has been measured with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated.<ref name=mnras385_4_1691 /> Epsilon Eridani's hot corona results in a mass loss rate in Epsilon Eridani's stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun's. This stellar wind generates the astrosphere that spans about {{convert|8000|au|pc|abbr=on}} and contains a [[bow shock]] that lies {{convert|1600|au|pc|abbr=on}} from Epsilon Eridani. At its estimated distance from Earth, this astrosphere spans 42&nbsp;arcminutes, which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon.<ref name=apj574_1 />\n\n=== Kinematics ===\nEpsilon Eridani has a high [[proper motion]], moving \u22120.976&nbsp;arcseconds per year in [[right ascension]] (the celestial equivalent of longitude) and 0.018&nbsp;arcseconds per year in [[declination]] (celestial latitude), for a combined total of 0.962 arcseconds per year.<ref name=aaa474_2_653 />{{refn|1=The total proper motion \u03bc can be computed from:\n: \u03bc<sup>2</sup> = (\u03bc<sub>\u03b1</sub> cos \u03b4)<sup>2</sup> + \u03bc<sub>\u03b4</sub><sup>2</sup>\nwhere \u03bc<sub>\u03b1</sub> is the proper motion in right ascension, \u03bc<sub>\u03b4</sub> is the proper motion in declination, and \u03b4 is the declination.<ref name=\"birney\" /> This yields:\n: \u03bc<sup>2</sup> = (\u2212975.17 \u00b7 cos(\u22129.458\u00b0))<sup>2</sup> + 19.49<sup>2</sup> = 925658.1\nor \u03bc equals 962.11.|group=\"note\"|name=total_pm}} The star has a radial velocity of {{convert|+15.5|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} (away from the Sun).<ref name=rgcrv66 /> The [[space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]] components of Epsilon Eridani in the [[galactic coordinate system|galactic co-ordinate system]] are {{nowrap|(U, V, W)}} = {{nowrap|(\u22123, +7, \u221220) km/s}}, which means that it is travelling within the [[Milky Way]] at a mean [[galactocentric distance]] of 28.7&nbsp;kly (8.79&nbsp;kiloparsecs) from the core along an orbit that has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.09.<ref name=ab6_2_308 /> The [[Stellar kinematics|velocity and heading]] of Epsilon Eridani indicate that it may be a member of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], whose members share a common motion through space. This behaviour suggests that the moving group originated in an [[open cluster]] that has since diffused.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /><ref name=an325_1_3 /> The estimated age of this group is {{nowrap|500\u00b1100 million}} years,<ref name=apj125_4_1980 /> which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani.\n\nDuring the past million years, three stars are believed to have come within {{convert|7|ly|pc|abbr=on}} of Epsilon Eridani. The most recent and closest of these encounters was with [[Kapteyn's Star]], which approached to a distance of about {{convert|3|ly|pc|abbr=on}} roughly 12,500 years ago. Two more distant encounters were with [[Sirius]] and [[Ross 614]]. None of these encounters are thought to have been close enough to affect the circumstellar disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=asp2001_227 />\n\nEpsilon Eridani made its closest approach to the Sun about 105,000&nbsp;years ago, when they were separated by {{convert|7|ly|pc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=aaa379 /> Based upon a simulation of close encounters with nearby stars, the binary star system [[Luyten 726-8]], which includes the [[variable star]] [[UV Ceti]], will encounter Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years at a minimum distance of about 0.9&nbsp;ly (0.29&nbsp;parsecs). They will be less than 1&nbsp;ly (0.3&nbsp;parsecs) apart for about 4,600 years.

The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18&nbsp;arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60&nbsp;AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35\u201375 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30&nbsp;AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's [[Kuiper belt]]: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25\u00b0 to the line of sight.<ref name=apj506_2_L133 />\n\nDust and possibly water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a process by which stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the [[Poynting\u2013Robertson effect]].<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 /> At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale for all of the dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.<ref name=apj690_2_1522 />\n\nThe disk contains an estimated mass of dust equal to a sixth of the mass of the Moon, with individual dust grains exceeding 3.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in size at a temperature of about 55&nbsp;K. This dust is being generated by the collision of comets, which range up to 10 to 30&nbsp;km in diameter and have a combined mass of 5 to 9 times that of Earth. This is similar to the estimated 10 Earth masses in the primordial Kuiper belt.<ref name=apj619_2_L187 /><ref name=emp92_1_1 /> The disk around Epsilon Eridani contains less than {{nowrap|2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>17</sup> kg}} of [[carbon monoxide]]. This low level suggests a paucity of volatile-bearing comets and icy [[planetesimal]]s compared to the Kuiper belt.<ref name=mnras348_3_L39 />\n\nThe clumpy structure of the dust belt may be explained by gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]].<ref name=apjl_537_L147 /> In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an [[orbital eccentricity]] of about 0.3.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 /> Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between [[minor planet]]s known as [[plutino]]s.<ref name=aj140_4_1007 />\n\nObservations from NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] suggest that Epsilon Eridani actually has two asteroid belts and a cloud of [[exozodiacal dust]]. The latter is an analogue of the [[zodiacal dust]] that occupies the plane of the [[Solar System]]. One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System, orbiting at a distance of {{nowrap|3.00 \u00b1 0.75 AU}} from Epsilon Eridani, and consists of [[silicate]] grains with a diameter of 3&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u03bcm]] and a combined mass of about 10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;kg. If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet, so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as [[asteroid]]s.<ref name=aaa499_2_L13 /> The second, denser belt, most likely also populated by asteroids, lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk. The structure of the belts and the dust disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration.<ref name=apj690_2_1522 /><ref name=spitzer20081027 />\n\nIn an alternative scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90&nbsp;AU from Epsilon Eridani and has an assumed mass of 10<sup>\u22123</sup> times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], located beyond 10&nbsp;AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100&nbsp;K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and [[silicate]] dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack [[volatiles]].<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 />\n\nThe inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a radius of 2.5&nbsp;AU inward, appears to be clear of dust down to the detection limit of the 6.5&nbsp;m [[MMT Observatory|MMT telescope]]. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while the presence of a planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.<ref name=apj693_2_1500 />\n\n=== Possible planets ===\n[[File:NASA-JPL-Caltech - Double the Rubble (PIA11375) (pd).jpg|right|thumb|Artist's impression, showing two asteroid belts and a planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani|alt=A bright light source at right is encircled by comets and two oval belts of debris.

Values for its orbital period range from 6.85 to 7.2 years.<ref name=aj132_2206 /> Estimates of the size of its elliptical orbit\u2014the [[semimajor axis]]\u2014range from 3.38 AU to 3.50 AU<ref name=cne2008 /><ref name=apj646_505 /> and approximations of its [[orbital eccentricity]] range from {{nowrap|0.25 \u00b1 0.23}} to {{nowrap|0.702 \u00b1 0.039}}.<ref name=aj132_2206 /><ref name=apj646_505 />\n\nThe true mass of this planet remains unknown, but it can be estimated based on the displacement effect of the planet's gravity on Epsilon Eridani. Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth is known, which yields a value for the formula [[Stellar rotation#Measurement|''m''&nbsp;sin&nbsp;''i'']], where ''m'' is the mass of the planet and ''i'' is the [[orbital inclination]]. Estimates for the value of {{nowrap|''m'' sin ''i''}} range from 0.60 [[Jupiter mass]]es to 1.06 Jupiter masses,<ref name=cne2008 /><ref name=apj646_505 /> which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet (because the [[sine]] function has a maximum value of 1). Taking {{nowrap|''m'' sin ''i''}} in the middle of that range at 0.78, and estimating the inclination at 30\u00b0, this yields the frequently cited value of {{nowrap|1.55 \u00b1 0.24}} Jupiter masses for the planet's mass.<ref name=aj132_2206 />\n\nOf all the measured parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity is the most uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b's eccentricity is inconsistent with the presence of the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3&nbsp;AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;b's eccentricity of about 0.10\u20130.15.<ref name=aaa499_2_L13 /><ref name=spitzer20081027 /> If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.<ref name=arxiv1011_4882 />\n\n==== Planet c ====\n[[File:View epsilon eridani c.png|right|thumb|Artist's impression of the unconfirmed second planet as seen from a hypothetical moon. The distant Epsilon Eridani is visible on the left, surrounded by a faint disk of dust particles.|alt=At left is a luminous point encircled by a nebulous grey belt. To the right is a crescent-shaped blue planet. Along the bottom is the rugged terrain of a moon surface.]]\nComputer simulations of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani suggest that the shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;c. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have [[Orbital resonance|resonant]] orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridani&nbsp;c would orbit at a distance of 40&nbsp;AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years.<ref name=apj578_2_L149 /> The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets.<ref name=aaa488_2_771 /> Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10&nbsp;AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.<ref name=mnras347_2_613 />\n\n==== Potential habitability ====\nEpsilon Eridani is a target for planet finding programs because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]], it was a target star for NASA's proposed [[Space Interferometry Mission]] to search for Earth-sized planets.<ref name=mccarcty2008 /> The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an [[interstellar probe]] can be sent to Epsilon Eridani.<ref name=jsr22_345 /><ref name=jbis29_94 /><ref name=mcnutt2000 />\n\nThe orbital radius at which the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the [[solar constant]]\u2014where the emission matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth\u2014is 0.61 astronomical units (AU).<ref name=aaa511 /> That is within the maximum [[habitable zone]] of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0&nbsp;AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages over a period of 20&nbsp;billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6\u20131.4&nbsp;AU.<ref name=ijab2_289 /> The presence of a large planet with a highly [[elliptical orbit]] in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a [[terrestrial planet]] having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.<ref name=jones_underwood_sleep2003 />\n\nA young star such as Epsilon Eridani can produce large amounts of [[ultraviolet]] radiation that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5&nbsp;AU.<ref name=asp2003 /> Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for [[interstellar travel]] in [[science fiction]] stories.<ref name=boyle2009 />\n\nFrom Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in [[Serpens]].<ref name=sun group=note />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Epsilon Eridani in fiction]]\n* [[List of exoplanetary host stars]]\n* [[Lists of planets]]\n* [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs]]\n\n== Notes  ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=50em|group=note|refs=\n{{refn|1=The rotation period ''P<sub>\u03b2</sub>'' at latitude ''\u03b2'' is given by:\n:''P<sub>\u03b2</sub>'' = ''P<sub>eq</sub>''/(1 \u2212 ''k'' sin ''\u03b2'')\nwhere ''P<sub>eq</sub>'' is the equatorial rotation period and  ''k'' is the differential rotation parameter.

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,800 men which include half of the British infantry contingent, along with a few hundred auxiliaries<ref>https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-battle-of-isandlwana-and-the-anglo-zulu-war-of-1879</ref> and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind approximately 600 British [[Red coat (military uniform)|Redcoats]] \u2013 five companies, around 90 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 700 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]], local mounted irregulars, and other units. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, over 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp excluding civilian auxiliaries.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a Rocket Battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

The fighting had been [[hand-to-hand combat]] and [[no quarter]] was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1C</ref>\n[[File:Zuluattackgutt.jpg|thumb|Lts Melvill and Coghill attacked by Zulu warriors.]]\n\n[[File:The Flags of the World Plate 10.png|thumb|upright|#94 the flag of the 24th Regiment (2nd Warwickshire) (Post-1881 [[Childers Reforms]] known as the [[South Wales Borderers]]).]]\nThe British fought back-to-back<ref>see Charles Edwin Fripp's painting in the National Army Museum</ref> with bayonet and rifle butt when their ammunition had finally been expended.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 49; Morris, pp. 375, 377.</ref> A Zulu account relates the single-handed fight by the guard of Chelmsford's tent, a big Irishman of the 24th who kept the Zulus back with his [[bayonet]] until he was speared and the general's Union flag captured.<ref name=\"Lock 219\"/> Both the colours of the 2nd 24th were lost, while the Queen's colour of the 1st 24th was carried off the field by [[Teignmouth Melvill|Lieutenant Melvill]] on horseback but lost when he crossed the river, despite [[Nevill Coghill (VC)|Lieutenant Coghill]] coming to his aid.

Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John.

Laband, p. 6, \"Chelmsford launched his 2nd invasion&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nRecent historians, notably Lock and Quantrill in ''Zulu Victory'', argue that from the Zulu perspective the [[theatre of operations]] included the diversions around [[Magogo]] Hills and Mangeni Falls and that these diversions, which drew more than half of Chelmsford's forces away from Isandlwana, were deliberate.<ref>Lock, p. 230.</ref> Also, the main Zulu force was not unexpectedly discovered in their encampment but was fully deployed and ready to advance on the British camp. These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979. Details and diagrams of squares used by British</ref>\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{more citations needed|date = January 2013}}\nChelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,800 men which include half of the British infantry contingent, along with a few hundred auxiliaries<ref>https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-battle-of-isandlwana-and-the-anglo-zulu-war-of-1879</ref> and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind approximately 600 British [[Red coat (military uniform)|Redcoats]] \u2013 five companies, around 90 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 700 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]], local mounted irregulars, and other units. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, over 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp excluding civilian auxiliaries.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22.

Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John.

These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311.

''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979.

He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events.

However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2012|page=219}} writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}}}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole. This is where the socialist tradition of thought might still have something to contribute to the democratic project and herein lies the promise of a liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}}}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn 1919, the Hungarian politician [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]] declared his support for what he termed \"liberal socialism\" while denouncing \"communist socialism\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, J\u00e1szi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a \"radical middle-class\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the [[Bolshevik]] revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], calling his views \"Anti-Marx\". His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} He argued that \"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|communist party]]-rule.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Liberalism]]\n* [[Liberal Socialist Party (Switzerland)]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social liberalism]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Third Way]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anton|first1=Anatole|last2=Schmitt|first2=Richard|year=2012|title=Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher=Lxeington Books|isbn=9780739166352|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Roland Willey|year=1970|title=The Success of Modern Private Enterprise|publisher=Interstate Printers & Publishers|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bastow|first1=Steve|last2=Martin|first2=James|year=2003|title=Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce|chapter=J.

However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2012|page=219}} writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}}}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole. This is where the socialist tradition of thought might still have something to contribute to the democratic project and herein lies the promise of a liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}}}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn 1919, the Hungarian politician [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]] declared his support for what he termed \"liberal socialism\" while denouncing \"communist socialism\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, J\u00e1szi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a \"radical middle-class\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the [[Bolshevik]] revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], calling his views \"Anti-Marx\". His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} He argued that \"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|communist party]]-rule.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Liberalism]]\n* [[Liberal Socialist Party (Switzerland)]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social liberalism]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Third Way]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anton|first1=Anatole|last2=Schmitt|first2=Richard|year=2012|title=Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher=Lxeington Books|isbn=9780739166352|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Roland Willey|year=1970|title=The Success of Modern Private Enterprise|publisher=Interstate Printers & Publishers|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bastow|first1=Steve|last2=Martin|first2=James|year=2003|title=Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce|chapter=J.
