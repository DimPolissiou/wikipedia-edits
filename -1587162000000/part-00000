He argues that realism and liberalism are both fragments of a broader tradition of republican thought. In contrast to either realism or liberalism, republican political thought is focused on negotiating the space between [[anarchy in international relations|anarchy]] and [[hierarchy]].

One source from the 1830s states that cousin marriage was less common in [[Cairo]] than in other areas. In traditional Syria-Palestina, if a girl had no paternal male cousin (father's brother's son) or he renounced his right to her, the next in line was traditionally the maternal male cousin (mother's brother's son) and then other relatives.

He has shown that while a clear functional connection exists between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to actually marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages.

These included not only cousin marriages, but also [[uncle-niece union]]s. Reportedly, it is a custom that in such marriages at least one spouse must be a relative, and generally such spouses were the preferred or favorite wives in the marriage and gave birth to more children. However, this was not a general study of Yoruba, but only of highly polygynous Yoruba residing in Oka Akoko.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Scott-Emuakpor|Scott-Emuakpor 1974]]</ref> \n\nThe Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria, who are predominantly Christian, strictly practice non-consanguineal marriages, where kinfolks and cousins are not allowed to marry or have intimacy. Consequently, men and women are forbidden to marry within their recent patrilineage and matrilineage. Before the advent of Christianity through colonization, the Igbos had always frowned upon and specifically prohibited consanguineal marriages, both the parallel and cross-cousin types, which are considered incestuous and cursed.  Arranged marriages, albeit in great decline, was also done to consciously prevent accidental consanguineal and bad marriages, such that the impending in-laws were aware of each other's family histories. Currently, like in the old days, before courtship commences, thorough enquiries are made by both families to not only ascertain character traits, but to also ensure their children are not related by blood. Traditionally, parents closely monitor whom their children relate intimately to avoid having them commit incest. Proactively, it is customary for parents to groom their children to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. <ref>[[Cousin marriage#Schwimmer|Schwimmer 2003]]</ref>\n\nIn Ethiopia, most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage, and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Crummey|Crummey 1983]], p. 207</ref> They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously.

Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]] said that cousin marriage was a typical pattern in Rome, based on the marriage of four children of Emperor Constantine to their first cousins and on writings by [[Plutarch]] and [[Livy]] indicating the proscription of cousin marriage in the early Republic.<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], pp. 51\u20132</ref> Professors [[Brent Shaw]] and Richard Saller, however, counter in their more comprehensive treatment that cousin marriages were never habitual or preferred in the western empire: for example, in one set of six stemmata (genealogies) of Roman aristocrats in the two centuries after [[Octavian]], out of 33 marriages, none was between first or second cousins. Such marriages carried no social stigma in the late Republic and early Empire. They cite the example of Cicero attacking Mark Antony not on the grounds of cousin marriage, but instead on grounds of Antony's divorce.\n\nShaw and Saller propose in their thesis of low cousin marriage rates that as families from different regions were incorporated into the imperial Roman nobility, [[exogamy]] was necessary to accommodate them and to avoid destabilizing the Roman social structure. Their data from tombstones further indicate that in most of the western empire, parallel-cousin marriages were not widely practiced among commoners, either. [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Noricum]] were exceptions to this rule, but even there, the rates did not rise above 10%.<ref name=\"Shaw 1984\">[[#ShawSaller|Shaw 1984]]</ref> They further point out that since property belonging to the nobility was typically fragmented,{{clarify|date=November 2012}} keeping current assets in the family offered no advantage, compared with acquiring it by intermarriage. Jack Goody claimed that early Christian marriage rules forced a marked change from earlier norms to deny heirs to the wealthy and thus to increase the chance that those with wealth would will their property to the Church. Shaw and Saller, however, believe that the estates of aristocrats without heirs had previously been claimed by the emperor, and that the Church merely replaced the emperor. Their view is that the Christian injunctions against cousin marriage were due more to ideology than to any conscious desire to acquire wealth.<ref name=\"Shaw 1984\" />\n\nFor some prominent examples of cousin marriages in ancient Rome, such as the marriage of Octavian's daughter to his sister's son, see the [[Julio-Claudian family tree]]. [[Marcus Aurelius]] also married his maternal first cousin [[Faustina the Younger]], and they had 13 children. Cousin marriage was more frequent in [[Ancient Greece]], and marriages between uncle and niece were also permitted there.<ref name=\"ottenheimer3\" /> One example is King [[Leonidas I]] of Sparta, who married his [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|half-niece]]. A Greek woman who became ''[[epikleros]]'', or heiress with no brothers, was obliged to marry her father's nearest male kin if she had not yet married and given birth to a male heir. First in line would be either her father's brothers or their sons, followed by her father's sisters' sons.<ref>[[#Patterson|Patterson 1998]], p. 98</ref> According to Goody, cousin marriage was allowed in the newly Christian and presumably also pre-Christian Ireland, where an heiress was also obligated to marry a paternal cousin. From the seventh century, the Irish Church only recognized four [[Prohibited degree of kinship|degrees of prohibited kinship]], and civil law fewer. This persisted until after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman conquests]] in the 11th century and the [[synod]] at [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] in 1101.<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], p. 45</ref> In contrast, contemporary English law was based on official Catholic policy, and Anglo-Norman clergy often became disgusted with the Irish \"law of fornication\".<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], p. 44</ref> Finally, [[Edward Westermarck]] states that marriage among the ancient [[Teutons]] was apparently prohibited only in the ascending and descending lines and among siblings.<ref>[[#Westermarck|Westermarck 1921]], Vol. 2, p. 101</ref>\n\n===United States===\nAnthropologist Martin Ottenheimer argues that marriage prohibitions were introduced to maintain the social order, uphold religious morality, and safeguard the creation of fit offspring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.ksu.edu/~omar/|title=Index of /~omar|website=www-personal.ksu.edu}}</ref> Writers such as [[Noah Webster]] (1758\u20131843) and ministers like [[Philip Milledoler]] (1775\u20131852) and Joshua McIlvaine helped lay the groundwork for such viewpoints well before 1860. This led to a gradual shift in concern from affinal unions, like those between a man and his deceased wife's sister, to [[Consanguinity|consanguineous]] unions. By the 1870s, [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818\u20131881) was writing about \"the advantages of marriages between unrelated persons\" and the necessity of avoiding \"the evils of consanguine marriage\", avoidance of which would \"increase the vigor of the stock\". To many, Morgan included, cousin marriage, and more specifically [[parallel and cross cousins|parallel-cousin]] marriage, was a remnant of a more primitive stage of human social organization.<ref>Ottenheimer. p. 111.</ref> Morgan himself had married his cousin in 1853.<ref name=\"ottenheimer\"/>\n\nIn 1846, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[George N. Briggs]] appointed a commission to study mentally handicapped people (termed \"[[idiot]]s\") in the state. This study implicated cousin marriage as responsible for idiocy. Within the next two decades, numerous reports (e.g., one from the Kentucky Deaf and Dumb Asylum) appeared with similar conclusions: that cousin marriage sometimes resulted in [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and idiocy. Perhaps most important was the report of physician Samuel Merrifield Bemiss<!--- famousamericans.net/samuelmerrifieldbemiss/ ---> for the [[American Medical Association]], which concluded cousin inbreeding does lead to the \"physical and mental depravation of the offspring\". Despite being contradicted by other studies like those of [[George Darwin]] and Alan Huth in England and Robert Newman in New York, the report's conclusions were widely accepted.<ref name=ottenheimer2/>\n\nThese developments led to 13 states and territories passing cousin marriage prohibitions by the 1880s. Though contemporaneous, the [[eugenics]] movement did not play much of a direct role in the bans. George Louis Arner in 1908 considered the ban a clumsy and ineffective method of eugenics, which he thought would eventually be replaced by more refined techniques. By the 1920s, the number of bans had doubled.<ref name=\"okbyscience\" /> Since that time, Kentucky (1943) and Texas have banned first-cousin marriage and since 1985, Maine has mandated genetic counseling for marrying cousins to minimise risk to any of serious health defect to their children. The [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] unanimously recommended in 1970 that all such laws should be repealed, but no state has dropped its prohibition.<ref name=\"plos\" /><ref name=kissyourcousin /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Cousin marriage#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black 2009]], Section 2</ref>\n\n==Legal status==\n{{Expand section|more countries and regions|date=March 2010}}\n\n[[File:CousinMarriageWorld.svg|700px|Laws regarding first-cousin marriage around the world.]]\n{{legend|#000099|First-cousin marriage legal}}\n{{legend|#0066ff|Allowed with restrictions or exceptions}}\n{{legend|#ec8028|Legality dependent on religion or culture<sup>2</sup>}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|Statute bans first-cousin marriage}}\n{{legend|#ff7777|Banned with exceptions}}\n{{legend|#990000|Criminal offence}}\n{{legend|#b9b9b9|No available data}}\n<sup>1</sup>For information on US states see the map below.<br />\n<sup>2</sup>See sections on [[Cousin marriage#India|India]] and [[Cousin marriage#Hinduism|Hinduism]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===East Asia===\nIn the Far East, [[South Korea]] is especially restrictive with bans on marriage out to third cousins, with all couples having the same surname and region of origin having been prohibited from marrying until 1997.<ref>See [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]] and {{Cite journal\n |url=http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/english/download/decision_10years.pdf \n |title=THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE KOREAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT \n |publisher=Constitutional Court of Korea \n |page=242 (p.256 of the PDF) \n |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} \n |ref=harv \n |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219184747/http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/english/download/decision_10years.pdf \n |archivedate=19 February 2012 \n}}.</ref>\n\n[[Taiwan]], [[North Korea]], and the [[Philippines]] also prohibit first-cousin marriage.<ref name=plos/><ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/executiveorderno209.htm Family Code of the Philippines].

The family law in India takes into account the religious and cultural practices and they are all equally recognized. For [[Islam in India|Muslims]], governed by uncodified personal law, it is acceptable and legal to marry a first cousin, but for [[Hinduism in India|Hindus]], it may be illegal under the 1955 [[Hindu Marriage Act]], though the specific situation is more complex. The Hindu Marriage Act makes cousin marriage illegal for Hindus with the exception of marriages permitted by regional custom.<ref name=\"indiasocialstructure\" /> Practices of the small [[Christianity in India|Christian]] minority are also location-dependent: their cousin marriage rates are higher in southern states such as [[Karnataka]] with high overall rates.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1991]], p. 791</ref>\nApart from the religion-based personal laws governing marriages, the civil marriage law named [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] governs. Those who do not wish to marry based on the personal laws governed by religious and cultural practices may opt for marriage under this law. It defines the first-cousin relationship, both parallel and cross, as prohibited. Conflict may arise between the prohibited degrees based on this law and personal law, but in absence of any other laws, it is still unresolved.<ref>http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/report212.pdf</ref>\n\nCousin marriage is proscribed and seen as incest for Hindus in [[North India]]. In fact, it may even be unacceptable to marry within one's village or for two siblings to marry partners from the same village.<ref>Dhavendra Kumar. ''Genetic Disorders of the Indian Subcontinent''. Kluwer Academic Publishers: AA Dordrecht, Netherlands, 2000. 127.</ref> The northern kinship model prevails in the states of [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Sikkim]], [[Tripura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], and [[West Bengal]]. However, for some communities in [[South India]], it is common for Hindu cross cousins to marry, with [[matrilateral]] [[cross-cousin]] (mother's brother's daughter) marriages being especially favored.<ref>W. H. R. Rivers. \"The Marriage of Cousins in India.\" Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. 1907.</ref> In the region, \"[[Avunculate marriage|uncle-niece]] and first-cousin unions are preferential and jointly account for some 30% of marriages\".<ref>Arthur P. Wolf, ''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo''\nThe State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', [[Stanford University Press]] (2005), p. 46''</ref>\n\nIn many North Indian communities, such as [[Brahmin]]s, [[Rajput]]s, [[Vaishya]]s, [[Jat]]s, [[Yadav]]s, everyone who is immediately associated with four surnames \u2014 own surname (that is father's surname), mother's maiden surname, paternal grandmother's maiden surname, maternal grandmother's maiden surname \u2014 falls outside the permissible marriage circle. These surnames are known as the candidate's ''[[gotra]]'' (lit. branch). Any two candidates who want to marry cannot have a common ''gotra''. The marriage is allowed only when all these ''shakha'' (branches) are different for both the candidates, so this automatically rules out closer cousin marriages. Cousin marriage is discouraged amongst Telugu Brahmins in Andhra Pradesh, such as Gauda and Dravida Brahmins.\n\nPractices in [[West India]] overall are closer to the northern than the southern,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|title=India - Marriage|website=countrystudies.us}}</ref> but differences exist here again. For instance, in [[Mumbai]], studies done in 1956 showed 7.7% of Hindus married to a second cousin or closer. By contrast, in the northern city of [[New Delhi]], only 0.1% of Hindus were married to a first cousin during the 1980s. At the other extreme, studies were done in the South Indian state of Karnataka, which contains [[Bangalore]], during that period show fully one-third of Hindus married to a second cousin or closer.<ref name=\"tables\" /> Pre-2000 Madhya Pradesh, from which Chhattisgarh has now split, and [[Maharashtra]], which contains Mumbai, are states that are intermediate in their kinship practices.\n\nIndia's Muslim minority represents about 14% of its population and has an overall rate of cousin marriage of 22% according to a 2000 report.  This may be a legacy of the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan, when substantial Muslim migration to [[Pakistan]] occurred from the eastern parts of the former unified state of Punjab. In south India, by contrast, the rates are fairly constant, except for the South Indian [[Malabar region|Malabar]] Muslims of Kerala (9%) who claim descent from Arab traders who settled permanently in India in the eighth century. Most Indian Muslims, by contrast, are the result of Hindus' [[Religious conversion|conversions]] to Islam in the 16th century or later. The lowest rate for a whole Indian region was in East India (15%). Consanguinity rates were generally stable across the four decades for which data exist, though second-cousin marriage appears to have been decreasing in favor of first-cousin marriage.\nA further study shows 78% of marriages in India are between cousins from the same villages- as of January 2018. This number is significantly rising as poverty increases, forcing people to marry within their casts.\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]], cousin marriage is legal and common. Reasons for consanguinity are for economic, religious and cultural reasons.<ref>[[#Shaw|Shaw 2001]], p. 322</ref> Consanguineous marriage in Pakistan was reported to be higher than 60% of the population in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zahid|first=Muhammad|last2=Bittles|first2=Alan H.|last3=Sthanadar|first3=Aftab Alam|date=September 2014|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=46|issue=5|pages=698\u2013701|doi=10.1017/S0021932013000552|issn=1469-7599|title=Civil Unrest and the Current Profile of Consanguineous Marriage in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/23289/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=A.|date=1994|title=Comments on \"Consanguineous Marriages in Pakistan\"|journal=Pakistan Development Review|volume=33|issue=4 Pt 2|pages=675\u2013676|issn=0030-9729|pmid=12346200}}</ref>{{sfn|Shami|Schmitt|Bittles|1989}} In some areas, higher proportion of first-cousin marriages in Pakistan has been noted to be the cause of an increased rate of blood disorders in the population.{{sfn|Shami|Schmitt|Bittles|1989}}\n\n===United States===\nData on cousin marriage in the United States is sparse. It was estimated in 1960 that 0.2% of all marriages between [[Roman Catholics in the United States|Roman Catholics]] were between first or second cousins, but no more recent nationwide studies have been performed.<ref name=tables>{{cite web|url=http://www.consang.net/index.php/Global_prevalence_tables|title=Global prevalence tables|website=www.consang.net}}</ref> It is unknown what proportion of that number were first cousins, which is the group facing marriage bans. To contextualize the group's size, the total proportion of interracial marriages in 1960, the last census year before the end of anti-miscegenation statutes, was 0.4%, and the proportion of black-white marriages was 0.13%.<ref>U.S. Census.

Paul and Hamish G. Spencer speculate that legal bans persist in part due to \"the ease with which a handful of highly motivated activists\u2014or even one individual\u2014can be effective in the decentralized American system, especially when feelings do not run high on the other side of an issue.\"<ref>Paul and Spencer.</ref>\n\nA bill to repeal the ban on first-cousin marriage in [[Minnesota]] was introduced by [[Phyllis Kahn]] in 2003, but it died in committee. Republican Minority Leader [[Marty Seifert]] criticized the bill in response, saying it would \"turn us into a cold Arkansas\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpt.org/aatc/2009/06/25/quotes_for_inspiration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906043319/http://www.tpt.org/aatc/2009/06/25/quotes_for_inspiration|url-status=dead|title=TPT St. Paul. \"Quotes for Inspiration.\" June 25, 2009.|archivedate=6 September 2009}}</ref> According to the [[University of Minnesota]]'s ''The Wake'', Kahn was aware the bill had little chance of passing, but introduced it anyway to draw attention to the issue.

Texas Representative [[Harvey Hilderbran]], whose district includes the main FLDS compound, authored an amendment<ref>C.S.H.B. 3006.

While readily conceding that banning cousin marriage cannot be justified on genetic grounds, Saletan asks rhetorically whether it would be acceptable to legalize uncle-niece marriage or \"hard-core incest\" between siblings and then let genetic screening take care of the resulting problems.<ref name=\"slate\" />\nAn article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by Sarah Kershaw documents fear by many married cousins of being treated with derision and contempt. \"While many people have a story about a secret cousin crush or kiss, most Americans find the idea of cousins marrying and having children disturbing or even repulsive,\" notes the article. It gives the example of one mother, Mrs. Spring, whose daughter Kimberly Spring-Winters, 29, married her cousin Shane Winters, 37. She stated that when she has told people about her daughter's marriage, they have been shocked and that consequently she is afraid to mention it. They live in a small Pennsylvania town and she worries that her grandchildren will be treated as outcasts and ridiculed due to their parental status. Another cousin couple stated that their children's maternal grandparents have never met their two grandchildren because the grandparents severed contact out of disapproval for the couple's marriage. This couple withheld their names from publication.<ref name=\"kershaw\">{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Kershaw |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/garden/26cousins.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 |title = Shaking Off the Shame |date = 26 November 2009 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn most societies, cousin marriage apparently is more common among those of low socio-economic status, among the illiterate and uneducated, and in rural areas.<ref name=bittles1/> This may be due in part to the token or significantly reduced dowries and bridewealths that exist in such marriages and also the much smaller pool of viable marriage candidates in rural areas. Some societies also report a high prevalence among land-owning families and the ruling elite: here the relevant consideration is thought to be keeping the family estate intact over generations.<ref name=\"Bittles 1994, p. 567\"/> The average age at marriage is lower for cousin marriages, the difference in one Pakistani study being 1.10 and 0.84 years for first and second cousins, respectively. In Pakistan, the ages of the spouses were also closer together, the age difference declining from 6.5 years for unrelated couples to 4.5 years for first cousins. A marginal increase in time to first birth, from 1.6 years generally to 1.9 years in first cousins, may occur due to the younger age at marriage of consanguineous mothers and resultant adolescent subfertility or delayed consummation.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 570</ref>\n\nPredictions that cousin marriage would decline during the late 20th century in areas where it is preferential appear to have been largely incorrect. One reason for this is that in many regions, cousin marriage is not merely a cultural tradition, but is also judged to offer significant social and economic benefits. In South Asia, rising demands for [[dowry]] payments have caused dire economic hardship and have been linked to \"dowry deaths\" in a number of North Indian states. Where permissible, marriage to a close relative is hence regarded as a more economically feasible choice. Second, improvements in public health have led to decreased death rates and increased family sizes, making it easier to find a relative to marry if that is the preferred choice. Increases in cousin marriage in the West may also occur as a result of immigration from Asia and Africa. In the short term, some observers have concluded that the only new forces that could discourage such unions are government bans like the one China enacted in 1981. In the longer term, rates may decline due to decreased family sizes, making it more difficult to find cousins to marry.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 577</ref>\n\nCousin marriage is important in several anthropological theories by prominent authors such as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], [[Sir Edward Tylor]], and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. L\u00e9vi-Strauss viewed cross-cousin marriage as a form of exogamy in the context of a unilineal descent group, meaning either [[matrilineal]] or [[patrilineal]] descent. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage in societies with matrilineal descent meant that a male married into the family his mother's brother, building an [[alliance theory|alliance]] between the two families. However, marriage to a mother's sister daughter (a parallel cousin) would be [[endogamous]], here meaning inside the same descent group, and would therefore fail to build alliances between different groups. Correspondingly, in societies like China with patrilineal descent, marriage to a father's brother's daughter would fail at alliance building. And in societies with both types of descent, where a person belongs to the group of his mother's mother and father's father but not mother's father or father's mother, only cross-cousin marriages would successfully build alliances.<ref>Ottenheimer. p. 139.</ref>\n\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss postulated that cross-cousin marriage had the two consequences of setting up classes which automatically delimit the group of possible spouses and of determining a relationship that can decide whether a prospective spouse is to be desired or excluded. Whereas in other kinship systems one or another of these aspects dominates, in cross-cousin marriage they overlap and cumulate their effects. It differs from incest prohibitions in that the latter employs a series of negative relationships, saying whom one cannot marry, while cross-cousin marriage employs positive relationships, saying whom should marry. Most crucially, cross-cousin marriage is the only type of preferential union that can function normally and exclusively and still give every man and woman the chance to marry a cross-cousin. Unlike other systems such as the levirate, the sororate, or uncle-niece marriage, cross-cousin marriage is preferential because for obvious reasons these others cannot constitute the exclusive or even preponderant rule of marriage in any group. Cross-cousin marriage divides members of the same generation into two approximately equal groups, those of cross-cousins and \"siblings\" that include real siblings and parallel cousins. Consequently, cross-cousin marriage can be a normal form of marriage in a society, but the other systems above can only be privileged forms. This makes cross-cousin marriage exceptionally important.<ref>Elementary Structures of Kinship, Chapter 9, pp. 119\u201320</ref>\n\nCross-cousin marriage also establishes a division between prescribed and prohibited relatives who, from the viewpoint of biological proximity, are strictly interchangeable. L\u00e9vi-Strauss thought that this proved that the origin of the incest prohibition is purely social and not biological. Cross-cousin marriage in effect allowed the anthropologist to control for biological degree by studying a situation where the degree of prohibited and prescribed spouses were equal. In understanding why two relatives of the same biological degree would be treated so differently, L\u00e9vi-Strauss wrote, it would be possible to understand not only the principle of cross-cousin marriage but of the incest prohibition itself. For L\u00e9vi-Strauss cross-cousin marriage was not either socially arbitrary or a secondary consequence of other institutions like dual organization or the practice of exogamy. Instead, the ''raison d'etre'' of cross-cousin marriage could be found within the institution itself. Of the three types of institution of exogamy rules, dual organization, and cross-cousin marriage, the last was most significant, making the analysis of this form of marriage the crucial test for any theory of marriage prohibitions.<ref>Elementary Structures of Kinship, Chapter 9, p. 122</ref>\n\nMatrilateral cross-cousin marriage has been found by some anthropological researchers to be correlated with patripotestal jural authority, meaning rights or obligations of the father. According to some theories, in these kinship systems a man marries his matrilateral cross-cousin due to associating her with his nurturant mother. Due to this association, possibly reinforced by personal interaction with a specific cousin, he may become \"fond\" of her, rendering the relationship \"sentimentally appropriate\".<ref>{{cite book| title = Theory in anthropology: a source-book| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=q589AAAAIAAJ| year = 1968| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul Books| isbn = 978-0-7100-6172-0| pages = 105, 107| chapter = 10| editor1-last = Manners| first1 = Melford E| editor2-last = Kaplan| editor2-first = David| editor1-first = Robert Alan| last1 = Spiro }}</ref> ''Patrilateral'' cross-cousin marriage is the rarest of all types of cousin marriage, and there is some question as to whether it even exists.<ref>[[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], ''Les structures \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la parent\u00e9'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition.''</ref>\n\nIn contrast to L\u00e9vi-Strauss who viewed the exchange of women under matrilateral cross-cousin marriage as fundamentally egalitarian, anthropologist [[Edmund Leach]] held that such systems by nature created groups of junior and senior status and were part of the political structure of society. Under Leach's model, in systems where this form of marriage segregates descent groups into wife-givers and wife-takers, the social status of the two categories also cannot be determined by ''a priori'' arguments. Groups like the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] exhibiting matrilateral cross-cousin marriage do not exchange women in circular structures; where such structures do exist they are unstable. Moreover, the exchanging groups are not major segments of the society, but rather local descent groups from the same or closely neighboring communities. L\u00e9vi-Strauss held that women were always exchanged for some \"prestation\" which could either be other women or labor and material goods.

Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]] and [[Leonard Kasdan]] describe preferential parallel cousin marriage as leading to social fission, in the sense that \"feud and fission are not at all dysfunctional factors but are necessary to the persistence and viability of Bedouin society\". Their thesis is the converse of [[Fredrik Barth]]'s, who describes the fission as leading to the cousin marriage.<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], pp. 17\u201318</ref>  Per Murphy and Kasdan, the Arab system of parallel cousin marriage works against the creation of homogenous \"bounded\" and \"corporate\" kin groups and instead creates arrangements where every person is related by blood to a wide variety of people, with the degree of relationship falling off gradually as opposed to suddenly. Instead of corporate units, [[Arab]] society is described as having \"agnatic sections\", a kind of repeating fractal structure in which authority is normally weak at all levels but capable of being activated at the required level in times of war. They relate this to an old Arab proverb: \"Myself against my brother; my brother and I against my cousin; my cousin, my brother and I against the outsider.\"<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], pp. 19\u201320</ref> \"In such a society even the presence of a limited amount of cross-cousin marriage will not break the isolation of the kin group, for first cross cousins often end up being second parallel cousins.\"<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], p. 22</ref> Instead of organizing horizontally through affinal ties, when large scale organization is necessary it is accomplished vertically, by reckoning distance from shared ancestors.

Also, Isaac's son [[Jacob]] married [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], both his cousins ({{bibleverse||Genesis|28\u201329|HE}}). Jacob's brother [[Esau]] also married his cousin [[Mahalath]], daughter of [[Ishmael]]. According to many English Bible translations, the five [[daughters of Zelophehad]] married the \"sons of their father's brothers\" in the later period of [[Moses]]; although other translations merely say \"relatives\". (For example, the Catholic [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]] and [[New American Bible|NAB]] differ in {{bibleverse||Numbers|36:10\u201312|NAB}}.) During the apportionment of Israel following the journey out of Egypt, [[Caleb]] gives his daughter [[Achsah]] to his brother's son [[Othniel Ben Kenaz|Othniel]] according to the NAB ({{bibleverse||Joshua|15:17|NAB}}), though the Jewish [[Talmud]] says Othniel was simply Caleb's brother (Sotah 11b). The daughters of Eleazer also married the sons of Eleazer's brother Kish in the still later time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|23:22|HE}}). [[King Rehoboam]] and his wives [[Maacah]] and [[Mahalath (wife of Rehoboam)|Mahalath]] were grandchildren of David ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:20|HE}}).

At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, [[Emperor Constantine]], the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his half-brother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the [[Council of Agde]] in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the so-called [[Canon law|canon-law]] method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to ''sixth'' cousins, including by marriage. But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom, they were relaxed back to third cousins at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] in AD 1215. [[Pope Benedict XV]] reduced this to second cousins in 1917,<ref name=\"ottenheimer2\">\n{{cite book |title=Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth of Cousin Marriage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenrelativ00otte |chapter-url-access=registration |last=Ottenheimer |first=Martin |year=1996 |publisher=University of Illinois |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref> and finally, the current law was enacted in 1983.<ref name=beal/> In Catholicism, close relatives who have married unwittingly without a dispensation can receive an [[annulment]].\n\nThere are several explanations for the rise of Catholic cousin marriage prohibitions after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. One explanation is increasing [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence on church policy. G.E. Howard states, \"During the period preceding the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] invasion, speaking broadly, the church adhered to Roman law and custom; thereafter those of the Germans&nbsp;... were accepted.\"<ref>{{cite book |title = A History of Matrimonial Institutions |last = Howard |first = G.E. |year = 1904 |publisher = University of Chicago Press |page = 291 |volume = 1 |location = Chicago}}</ref> On the other hand, it has also been argued that the bans were a reaction ''against'' local Germanic customs of kindred marriage.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Development of the Family and Marriage in Europe |last = Goody |first = Jack |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |year = 1983 |page = 59}}</ref> At least one [[Franks|Frankish]] King, [[Pepin the Short]], apparently viewed close kin marriages among nobles as a threat to his power.<ref>{{cite book |first1 = Joseph |last1 = Gies |first2 = Frances |last2 = Gies |year = 1983 |title = Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages |publisher = Harper and Row |location = New York}}</ref> Whatever the reasons, written justifications for such bans had been advanced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] by the fifth century. \"It is very reasonable and just\", he wrote, \"that one man should not himself sustain many relationships, but that various relationships should be distributed among several, and thus serve to bind together the greatest number in the same social interests\".<ref name=ottenheimer3/> Taking a contrary view, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] writing after the [[Reformation]] tended to see the prohibitions and the dispensations needed to circumvent them as part of an undesirable church scheme to accrue wealth, or \"lucre\".<ref name=ottenheimer3>{{cite book |title=Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth of Cousin Marriage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenrelativ00otte |chapter-url-access=registration |last=Ottenheimer |first=Martin |year=1996 |publisher=University of Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5}}</ref>\n\nSince the 13th century the Catholic Church has measured consanguinity according to what is called, perhaps confusingly, the civil-law method. Under this method, the degree of relationship between lineal relatives (i.e., a man and his grandfather) is simply equal to the number of generations between them. However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree from one person, up to the common ancestor, and then back to the other person. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PC.HTM |title=Can. 108 |publisher=The Holy See |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115203405/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PC.HTM |archivedate=15 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches generally allow cousin marriage,<ref>Amy Strickland.

The [[Anglican Communion]] has also allowed cousin marriage since its inception during the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. According to Luther and Calvin, the Catholic bans on cousin marriage were an expression of Church rather than divine law and needed to be abolished. Protestants during the Reformation struggled to interpret the Biblical proscriptions against [[incest]] in a sensible manner, a task frustrated by facts like their omission of the daughter (but inclusion of the granddaughter) as a directly prohibited relation.<ref name=ottenheimer3/> John Calvin thought of the Biblical list only as illustrative and that any relationship of the same or smaller degree as any listed, namely the third degree by the civil-law method, should therefore be prohibited. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] reached the same conclusion soon after.<ref name=ottenheimer2/> But in contrast to both Protestantism and Catholicism, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] prohibits up to second cousins from marrying.<ref name=bittles1/> But, according to the latest constitution (of 2010) of The Orthodox Church of Cyprus, second cousins may marry as the restriction is placed up to relatives of the 5th degree [http://churchofcyprus.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KATASTATIKO_DIMOTIKI.pdf]. The reasoning is that marriage between close relatives can lead to intrafamily strife. The 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' refers to a theory by the [[Anglican]] [[bishop of Bath and Wells]] speculating that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the mother of [[Jesus]] and her husband, were first cousins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07204b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Heli (Eli) |accessdate=6 June 2007}}</ref> [[Jack Goody]] describes this theory as a \"legend\".<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], p. 53</ref>\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Cousin marriage in the Middle East}}\nThe [[Qur'an]] does not state that marriages between first cousins are forbidden.

However, these results may principally reflect village [[endogamy]] rather than consanguinity per se. Endogamy is marrying within a group and in this case the group was a village. The marital patterns of the Amish are also an example of endogamy.<ref name=\"BittlesBlack\">[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 6</ref>\n\nThe Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformation found an association between consanguinity and hydrocephalus, postaxial polydactyly, and bilateral oral and facial clefts. Another picture emerges from the large literature on congenital heart defects, which are conservatively estimated to have an incidence of 50/1,000 live births. A consistent positive association between consanguinity and disorders such as ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect has been demonstrated, but both positive and negative associations with patent ductus arteriosus, atrioventricular septal defect, pulmonary atresia, and [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] have been reported in different populations. Associations between consanguinity and Alzheimer's disease have been found in certain populations.<ref name=\"BittlesBlack\" /> Studies into the influence of inbreeding on anthropometric measurements at birth and in childhood have failed to reveal any major and consistent pattern, and only marginal declines were shown in the mean scores attained by consanguineous progeny in tests of intellectual capacity. In the latter case, it would appear that inbreeding mainly leads to greater variance in IQ levels, due in part to the expression of detrimental recessive genes in a small proportion of those tested.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 575</ref>\n\nA [[BBC]] report discussed [[British Pakistanis|Pakistanis in Britain]], 55% of whom marry a first cousin.<ref>Rowlatt, J, (2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4442010.stm \"The risks of cousin marriage\"], BBC Newsnight. Accessed 28 January 2007</ref> Given the high rate of such marriages, many children come from repeat generations of first-cousin marriages. The report states that these children are 13 times more likely than the general population to produce children with [[genetic disorder]]s, and one in ten children of first-cousin marriages in [[Birmingham]] either dies in infancy or develops a serious disability. The BBC also states that Pakistani-Britons, who account for some 3% of all births in the UK, produce \"just under a third\" of all British children with genetic illnesses. Published studies show that mean [[perinatal mortality]] in the Pakistani community of 15.7 per thousand significantly exceeds that in the indigenous population and all other ethnic groups in Britain. Congenital anomalies account for 41 percent of all British Pakistani infant deaths.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 576</ref> The BBC story contained an interview with Myra Ali, whose parents and grandparents were all first cousins. She has a very rare recessive genetic condition, known as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]] which will cause her to lead a life of extreme physical suffering, limited human contact and probably an early death from skin cancer. Knowing that cousin marriages increase the probability of recessive genetic conditions, she is understandably against the practice. Finally, in 2010 the Telegraph reported that cousin marriage among the British Pakistani community resulted in 700 children being born every year with genetic disabilities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7957808/700-children-born-with-genetic-disabilities-due-to-cousin-marriages-every-year.html|title=700 children born with genetic disabilities due to cousin marriages every year|first=Rebecca|last=Lefort|date=22 August 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe increased mortality and birth defects observed among British Pakistanis may, however, have another source besides current consanguinity. This is [[Wahlund effect|population subdivision]] among different Pakistani groups. Population subdivision results from decreased gene flow among different groups in a population. Because members of Pakistani ''biradari'' have married only inside these groups for generations, offspring have higher average [[homozygosity]] even for couples with no known genetic relationship.<ref>[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 5</ref> According to a statement by the UK's [[Human Genetics Commission]] on cousin marriages, the BBC also \"fails to clarify\" that children born to these marriages were not found to be 13 times more likely to develop genetic disorders. Instead they are 13 times more likely to develop ''recessive'' genetic disorders. The HGC states, \"Other types of genetic conditions, including chromosomal abnormalities, sex-linked conditions and autosomal dominant conditions are not influenced by cousin marriage.\" The HGC goes on to compare the biological risk between cousin marriage and increased maternal age, arguing that \"Both represent complex cultural trends. Both however, also carry a biological risk. They key difference, GIG argue, is that cousin marriage is more common amongst a British minority population.\"<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023095407/http://www.hgc.gov.uk/Client/Content.asp?ContentId=741 \"Statement on cousins who marry\"], Human Genetics Commission. Accessed 1 November 2009</ref> Genetic effects from cousin marriage in Britain are more obvious than in a developing country like Pakistan because the number of confounding environmental diseases is lower. Increased focus on genetic disease in developing countries may eventually result from progress in eliminating environmental diseases there as well.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 579</ref>\n\nComprehensive genetic education and premarital genetic counseling programs can help to lessen the burden of genetic diseases in endogamous communities. Genetic education programs directed at high-school students have been successful in Middle Eastern countries such as [[Bahrain]]. Genetic counseling in developing countries has been hampered, however, by lack of trained staff, and couples may refuse prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion despite the endorsement of religious authorities.<ref>[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 4</ref> In Britain, the Human Genetics Commission recommends a strategy comparable with previous strategies in dealing with increased maternal age, notably as this age relates to an increased risk of Down Syndrome. All pregnant women in Britain are offered a screening test from the government-run national health service to identify those at an increased risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. The HGC states that similarly, it is appropriate to offer genetic counseling to consanguineous couples, preferably before they conceive, in order to establish the precise risk of a genetic abnormality in offspring. Under this system the offering of genetic counseling can be refused, unlike, for example, in the US state of Maine where genetic counseling is mandatory to obtain a marriage license for first cousins. Leading researcher Alan Bittles also concluded that though consanguinity clearly has a significant effect on childhood mortality and genetic disease in areas where it is common, it is \"essential that the levels of expressed genetic defect be kept in perspective, and to realize that the outcome of consanguineous marriages is not subject to assessment solely in terms of comparative medical audit\".<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 578</ref> He states that the social, cultural, and economic benefits of cousin marriage also need to be fully considered.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1994]], p. 793</ref>\n\n===Fertility===\n\nHigher total fertility rates are reported for cousin marriages than average, a phenomenon noted as far back as [[George Darwin]] during the late 19th century. There is no significant difference in the number of surviving children in cousin marriages because this compensates for the observed increase in child mortality.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1994]], p. 790</ref> The total fertility increase may be partly explained by the lower average parental age at marriage, and age at first birth, observed in consanguineous marriages. Other factors include shorter birth intervals and possibly a lower likelihood of using reliable [[contraception]].<ref name=bittles1/> There is also the possibility of more births as a compensation for increased child mortality, either via a conscious decision by parents to achieve a set family size or the cessation of [[lactational amenorrhea]] following the death of an infant.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 571</ref> According to a recent paper the fertility difference is probably not due to any underlying biological effect.<ref>{{citation |title = Consanguineous marriage and differentials in age at marriage, contraceptive use and fertility in Pakistan |first1 = R. |first2 = A.H. |last1 = Hussein |last2 = Bittles |year = 1999 |publisher = Journal of Biosocial Science |pages = 121\u2013138 |url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=hbspapers}}</ref> In Iceland, where marriages between second and third cousins were common, in part due to limited selection, studies show higher fertility rates.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140855.htm Third Cousins Have Greatest Number Of Offspring, Data From Iceland Shows], Science Daily, 7 February 2008</ref> Earlier papers claimed that increased sharing of [[human leukocyte antigen]]s, as well as of deleterious recessive genes expressed during pregnancy, may lead to lower rates of conception and higher rates of miscarriage in consanguineous couples. Others now believe there is scant evidence for this unless the genes are operating very early in the pregnancy. Studies consistently show a lower rate of [[primary infertility]] in cousin marriages, usually interpreted as being due to greater immunological compatibility between spouses.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], pp. 568\u2013569</ref>\n\n==Famous cousin marriages==\n\n{{Main|List of coupled cousins}}\n\nCousin marriages in the United Kingdom include [[Charles Darwin]], [[Queen Victoria]] and [[John Granville Harkness]].\n\nIn royalty, marriage between cousins was common.

Some men also practiced [[sororate marriage]], that is, a marriage to a former wife's sister or a polygynous marriage to both sisters.

In Chinese culture, these patrilineal ties are most important in determining the closeness of a relation.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Zhaoxiang|Zhaoxiang 2001]], p. 355</ref> In the case of the MSD marriage, no such ties exist, so consequently this may not even be viewed as cousin marriage. Finally, one reason that MBD marriage is often most common may be the typically greater emotional warmth between a man and his mother's side of the family.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Zhaoxiang|Zhaoxiang 2001]], p. 356\u201357</ref> Later analyses have found regional variation in these patterns; in some rural areas where cousin marriage is still common, MBD is not preferred but merely acceptable, similar to MSD.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> By the early to mid-20th century, anthropologists described cross-cousin marriage in China as \"still permissible&nbsp;... but&nbsp;... generally obsolete\" or as \"permitted but not encouraged\".<ref name=\"Feng 1967, p. 43\" /><ref name=\"Chen 1932, p. 630\" />\n\n===Middle East===\n{{Main|Cousin marriage in the Middle East}}\n\nCousin marriage has been allowed throughout the Middle East for all recorded history.<ref>Goody, Marriage and the Family in Europe</ref> Anthropologists have debated the significance of the practice; some view it as the defining feature of the Middle Eastern kinship system<ref name=\"Patai\">Patai</ref> while others note that overall rates of cousin marriage have varied sharply between different Middle Eastern communities.<ref>Meriwether</ref> Very little numerical evidence exists of rates of cousin marriage in the past.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Holy|Holy]], also Patai, p. 140</ref>\n\n[[Raphael Patai]] reports that in central Arabia, no relaxation of a man's right to the father's brother's daughter, seems to have taken place in the past hundred years before his 1962 work. Here the girl is not forced to marry her male cousin, but she cannot marry another unless he gives consent.<ref>Patai, Golden River to Golden Road, 145\u2013153</ref> The force of the custom is seen in one case from Jordan when the father arranged for the marriage of his daughter to an outsider without obtaining the consent of her male cousin. When the marriage procession progressed with the bride toward the house of the bridegroom, the male cousin rushed forward, snatched away the girl, and forced her into his own house. This was regarded by all as a lawful marriage.<ref name=\"Patai 153\u2013161\">Patai 153\u2013161</ref> In Iraq, the right of the cousin has also traditionally been followed and a girl breaking the rule without the consent of the male cousin could have ended up murdered by him.<ref>Patai 166</ref> The Syrian city of [[Aleppo]] during the 19th century featured a rate of cousin marriage among the elite of 24% according to one estimate, a figure that masked widespread variation: some leading families had none or only one cousin marriage, while others had rates approaching 70%. Cousin marriage rates were highest among women,{{clarify|date=October 2011|see talk page, can this be explained by polygyny by men marrying two or more of their cousins?}} merchant families, and older well-established families.<ref>Meriwether p. 135</ref>\n\nIn-marriage was more frequent in the late pre-Islamic [[Hijaz]] than in ancient Egypt. It existed in [[Medina]] during Muhammad's time, but at less than today's rates.<ref>Patai 141</ref> In Egypt, estimates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries state variously that either 80% of ''[[fellahin]]'' married first cousins or two-thirds married them if they existed. One source from the 1830s states that cousin marriage was less common in [[Cairo]] than in other areas. In traditional Syria-Palestina, if a girl had no paternal male cousin (father's brother's son) or he renounced his right to her, the next in line was traditionally the maternal male cousin (mother's brother's son) and then other relatives. Raphael Patai, however, reported that this custom loosened in the years preceding his 1947 study.<ref name=\"Patai 153\u2013161\" /> In ancient Persia, the [[Achaemenid]] kings habitually married their cousins and nieces,<ref>Women in Ancient Persia, 559\u2013331 BC By Maria Brosius, p. 68</ref> while between the 1940s and 1970s, the percentage of Iranian cousin marriages increased from 34 to 44%.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Givens|Givens 1994]]</ref> Cousin marriage among native Middle Eastern Jews is generally far higher than among the European [[Ashkenazim]], who assimilated European marital practices after the [[diaspora]].<ref>Patai, The Myth of the Jewish Race, \"Cousin Marriage\"</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist [[Ladislav Hol\u00fd]], cousin marriage is not an independent phenomenon, but rather one expression of a wider Middle Eastern preference for agnatic solidarity, or solidarity with one's father's lineage. According to Hol\u00fd, the oft-quoted reason for cousin marriage of keeping property in the family is, in the Middle Eastern case, just one specific manifestation of keeping intact a family's whole \"symbolic capital\".<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Holy|Holy]], 110\u201317</ref> Close agnatic marriage has also been seen as a result of the conceptualization of men as responsible for the control of the conduct of women.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Holy|Holy]], 118\u201320</ref> [[Honor]] is another reason for cousin marriage: while the natal family may lose influence over the daughter through marriage to an outsider, marrying her in their kin group allows them to help prevent dishonorable outcomes like either attacks on her or her own unchaste behavior.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Holy|Holy]], 120\u20137</ref> Pragmatic reasons for the husband, such as warmer relations with his father-in-law, and those for parents of both spouses, like reduced bride price and access to the labor of the daughter's children, also contribute.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Holy|Holy]], Chapter 2</ref><ref>Patai 144\u2013145</ref> Throughout Middle Eastern history, cousin marriage has been both praised and discouraged by various writers and authorities.<ref>Patai 173\u201375</ref>\n\nA 2009 study found that many Arab countries display some of the highest rates of consanguineous marriages in the world, and that first cousin marriages which may reach 25\u201330% of all marriages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tadmour|2009}} ([http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/6/1/17/table/T1 Table 1]).</ref> In Qatar, Yemen, and UAE, consanguinity rates are increasing in the current generation.

These included not only cousin marriages, but also [[uncle-niece union]]s. Reportedly, it is a custom that in such marriages at least one spouse must be a relative, and generally such spouses were the preferred or favorite wives in the marriage and gave birth to more children. However, this was not a general study of Yoruba, but only of highly polygynous Yoruba residing in Oka Akoko.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Scott-Emuakpor|Scott-Emuakpor 1974]]</ref> \n\nThe Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria, who are predominantly Christian, strictly practice non-consanguineal marriages, where kinfolks and cousins are not allowed to marry or have intimacy. Consequently, men and women are forbidden to marry within their recent patrilineage and matrilineage. Before the advent of Christianity through colonization, the Igbos had always frowned upon and specifically prohibited consanguineal marriages, both the parallel and cross-cousin types, which are considered incestuous and cursed.  Arranged marriages, albeit in great decline, was also done to consciously prevent accidental consanguineal and bad marriages, such that the impending in-laws were aware of each other's family histories. Currently, like in the old days, before courtship commences, thorough enquiries are made by both families to not only ascertain character traits, but to also ensure their children are not related by blood. Traditionally, parents closely monitor whom their children relate intimately to avoid having them commit incest. Proactively, it is customary for parents to groom their children to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. <ref>[[Cousin marriage#Schwimmer|Schwimmer 2003]]</ref>\n\nIn Ethiopia, most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage, and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#Crummey|Crummey 1983]], p. 207</ref> They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously.

Later studies by George Darwin found results that resemble those estimated today. His father, Charles Darwin, who did marry his first cousin, had initially speculated that cousin marriage might pose serious risks, but perhaps in response to his son's work, these thoughts were omitted from a later version of the book they published. When a question about cousin marriage was eventually considered in 1871 for the census, according to George Darwin, it was rejected on the grounds that the idle curiosity of philosophers was not to be satisfied.<ref>{{cite book |title=Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth of Cousin Marriage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenrelativ00otte |chapter-url-access=registration |last=Ottenheimer |first=Martin |year=1996 |publisher=University of Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref> In Southern Italy, cousin marriage was a common practice within regions such as Calabria and Sicily where first cousin marriage in the previous century was close to 50% of all marriages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cascio|first=Justin|title=Rates of consanguineous marriage among Mafia families in Corleone.docx|url=https://www.academia.edu/35481323}}</ref> Cousin marriage to third cousins was allowed and considered favourably in Greece.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R17R1G4pUlQC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=third+cousin+marriage+among+greeks#v=onepage&q=third%20cousin%20marriage%20among%20greeks&f=false|title=Meaning and Identity in a Greek Landscape: An Archaeological Ethnography|last=Forbes|first=Hamish|date=October 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2019|isbn=9780521866996|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\nCousin and sibling marriage were legal in ancient Rome from the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC), until it was banned by the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 381 in the West, and until after the death of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (565) in the East,<ref>[[#TheEssentialOttenheimer|Ottenheimer 1996]], p. 63</ref><ref>[[#Grubbs|Grubbs 2002, p. 163]]</ref> but the proportion of such marriages is not clear. Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]] said that cousin marriage was a typical pattern in Rome, based on the marriage of four children of Emperor Constantine to their first cousins and on writings by [[Plutarch]] and [[Livy]] indicating the proscription of cousin marriage in the early Republic.<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], pp. 51\u20132</ref> Professors [[Brent Shaw]] and Richard Saller, however, counter in their more comprehensive treatment that cousin marriages were never habitual or preferred in the western empire: for example, in one set of six stemmata (genealogies) of Roman aristocrats in the two centuries after [[Octavian]], out of 33 marriages, none was between first or second cousins. Such marriages carried no social stigma in the late Republic and early Empire. They cite the example of Cicero attacking Mark Antony not on the grounds of cousin marriage, but instead on grounds of Antony's divorce.\n\nShaw and Saller propose in their thesis of low cousin marriage rates that as families from different regions were incorporated into the imperial Roman nobility, [[exogamy]] was necessary to accommodate them and to avoid destabilizing the Roman social structure. Their data from tombstones further indicate that in most of the western empire, parallel-cousin marriages were not widely practiced among commoners, either. [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Noricum]] were exceptions to this rule, but even there, the rates did not rise above 10%.<ref name=\"Shaw 1984\">[[#ShawSaller|Shaw 1984]]</ref> They further point out that since property belonging to the nobility was typically fragmented,{{clarify|date=November 2012}} keeping current assets in the family offered no advantage, compared with acquiring it by intermarriage. Jack Goody claimed that early Christian marriage rules forced a marked change from earlier norms to deny heirs to the wealthy and thus to increase the chance that those with wealth would will their property to the Church. Shaw and Saller, however, believe that the estates of aristocrats without heirs had previously been claimed by the emperor, and that the Church merely replaced the emperor. Their view is that the Christian injunctions against cousin marriage were due more to ideology than to any conscious desire to acquire wealth.<ref name=\"Shaw 1984\" />\n\nFor some prominent examples of cousin marriages in ancient Rome, such as the marriage of Octavian's daughter to his sister's son, see the [[Julio-Claudian family tree]]. [[Marcus Aurelius]] also married his maternal first cousin [[Faustina the Younger]], and they had 13 children. Cousin marriage was more frequent in [[Ancient Greece]], and marriages between uncle and niece were also permitted there.<ref name=\"ottenheimer3\" /> One example is King [[Leonidas I]] of Sparta, who married his [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|half-niece]]. A Greek woman who became ''[[epikleros]]'', or heiress with no brothers, was obliged to marry her father's nearest male kin if she had not yet married and given birth to a male heir. First in line would be either her father's brothers or their sons, followed by her father's sisters' sons.<ref>[[#Patterson|Patterson 1998]], p. 98</ref> According to Goody, cousin marriage was allowed in the newly Christian and presumably also pre-Christian Ireland, where an heiress was also obligated to marry a paternal cousin. From the seventh century, the Irish Church only recognized four [[Prohibited degree of kinship|degrees of prohibited kinship]], and civil law fewer. This persisted until after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman conquests]] in the 11th century and the [[synod]] at [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] in 1101.<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], p. 45</ref> In contrast, contemporary English law was based on official Catholic policy, and Anglo-Norman clergy often became disgusted with the Irish \"law of fornication\".<ref>[[#Goody|Goody 1983]], p. 44</ref> Finally, [[Edward Westermarck]] states that marriage among the ancient [[Teutons]] was apparently prohibited only in the ascending and descending lines and among siblings.<ref>[[#Westermarck|Westermarck 1921]], Vol. 2, p. 101</ref>\n\n===United States===\nAnthropologist Martin Ottenheimer argues that marriage prohibitions were introduced to maintain the social order, uphold religious morality, and safeguard the creation of fit offspring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.ksu.edu/~omar/|title=Index of /~omar|website=www-personal.ksu.edu}}</ref> Writers such as [[Noah Webster]] (1758\u20131843) and ministers like [[Philip Milledoler]] (1775\u20131852) and Joshua McIlvaine helped lay the groundwork for such viewpoints well before 1860. This led to a gradual shift in concern from affinal unions, like those between a man and his deceased wife's sister, to [[Consanguinity|consanguineous]] unions. By the 1870s, [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818\u20131881) was writing about \"the advantages of marriages between unrelated persons\" and the necessity of avoiding \"the evils of consanguine marriage\", avoidance of which would \"increase the vigor of the stock\". To many, Morgan included, cousin marriage, and more specifically [[parallel and cross cousins|parallel-cousin]] marriage, was a remnant of a more primitive stage of human social organization.<ref>Ottenheimer. p. 111.</ref> Morgan himself had married his cousin in 1853.<ref name=\"ottenheimer\"/>\n\nIn 1846, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[George N. Briggs]] appointed a commission to study mentally handicapped people (termed \"[[idiot]]s\") in the state. This study implicated cousin marriage as responsible for idiocy. Within the next two decades, numerous reports (e.g., one from the Kentucky Deaf and Dumb Asylum) appeared with similar conclusions: that cousin marriage sometimes resulted in [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and idiocy. Perhaps most important was the report of physician Samuel Merrifield Bemiss<!--- famousamericans.net/samuelmerrifieldbemiss/ ---> for the [[American Medical Association]], which concluded cousin inbreeding does lead to the \"physical and mental depravation of the offspring\". Despite being contradicted by other studies like those of [[George Darwin]] and Alan Huth in England and Robert Newman in New York, the report's conclusions were widely accepted.<ref name=ottenheimer2/>\n\nThese developments led to 13 states and territories passing cousin marriage prohibitions by the 1880s. Though contemporaneous, the [[eugenics]] movement did not play much of a direct role in the bans. George Louis Arner in 1908 considered the ban a clumsy and ineffective method of eugenics, which he thought would eventually be replaced by more refined techniques. By the 1920s, the number of bans had doubled.<ref name=\"okbyscience\" /> Since that time, Kentucky (1943) and Texas have banned first-cousin marriage and since 1985, Maine has mandated genetic counseling for marrying cousins to minimise risk to any of serious health defect to their children. The [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] unanimously recommended in 1970 that all such laws should be repealed, but no state has dropped its prohibition.<ref name=\"plos\" /><ref name=kissyourcousin /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Cousin marriage#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black 2009]], Section 2</ref>\n\n==Legal status==\n{{Expand section|more countries and regions|date=March 2010}}\n\n[[File:CousinMarriageWorld.svg|700px|Laws regarding first-cousin marriage around the world.]]\n{{legend|#000099|First-cousin marriage legal}}\n{{legend|#0066ff|Allowed with restrictions or exceptions}}\n{{legend|#ec8028|Legality dependent on religion or culture<sup>2</sup>}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|Statute bans first-cousin marriage}}\n{{legend|#ff7777|Banned with exceptions}}\n{{legend|#990000|Criminal offence}}\n{{legend|#b9b9b9|No available data}}\n<sup>1</sup>For information on US states see the map below.<br />\n<sup>2</sup>See sections on [[Cousin marriage#India|India]] and [[Cousin marriage#Hinduism|Hinduism]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===East Asia===\nIn the Far East, [[South Korea]] is especially restrictive with bans on marriage out to third cousins, with all couples having the same surname and region of origin having been prohibited from marrying until 1997.<ref>See [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]] and {{Cite journal\n |url=http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/english/download/decision_10years.pdf \n |title=THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE KOREAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT \n |publisher=Constitutional Court of Korea \n |page=242 (p.256 of the PDF) \n |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} \n |ref=harv \n |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219184747/http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/english/download/decision_10years.pdf \n |archivedate=19 February 2012 \n}}.</ref>\n\n[[Taiwan]], [[North Korea]], and the [[Philippines]] also prohibit first-cousin marriage.<ref name=plos/><ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/executiveorderno209.htm Family Code of the Philippines].

The proposed policy is explicitly aimed at preventing \"import marriages\" from certain nations like Morocco with a high rate of cousin marriage. Critics argue that such a ban would contradict Section 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], is not based on science, and would affect more than immigrants. While some proponents argue such marriages were banned until 1970, according to Frans van Poppel of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute, they are confusing cousin marriage with [[uncle-niece marriage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article794315.ece|title=Can cousin marriages be banned?|date=2009-09-23|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the English upper and upper-middle classes the prevalence of first-cousin marriage had remained steady at between 4% and 5% for much of the 19th century.

If  more than one relationship exists between spouses, as often results from successive generations of cousin marriage, only the patrilineal one is counted. Marriage within the lineage is preferred to marriage outside the lineage even when no exact [[genealogy|genealogical]] relationship is known. Of 277 first marriages, only 84 were between couples unable to trace any genealogical relationship between them. Of those, in 64, the spouses were of the same lineage.

The family law in India takes into account the religious and cultural practices and they are all equally recognized. For [[Islam in India|Muslims]], governed by uncodified personal law, it is acceptable and legal to marry a first cousin, but for [[Hinduism in India|Hindus]], it may be illegal under the 1955 [[Hindu Marriage Act]], though the specific situation is more complex. The Hindu Marriage Act makes cousin marriage illegal for Hindus with the exception of marriages permitted by regional custom.<ref name=\"indiasocialstructure\" /> Practices of the small [[Christianity in India|Christian]] minority are also location-dependent: their cousin marriage rates are higher in southern states such as [[Karnataka]] with high overall rates.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1991]], p. 791</ref>\nApart from the religion-based personal laws governing marriages, the civil marriage law named [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] governs. Those who do not wish to marry based on the personal laws governed by religious and cultural practices may opt for marriage under this law. It defines the first-cousin relationship, both parallel and cross, as prohibited. Conflict may arise between the prohibited degrees based on this law and personal law, but in absence of any other laws, it is still unresolved.<ref>http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/report212.pdf</ref>\n\nCousin marriage is proscribed and seen as incest for Hindus in [[North India]]. In fact, it may even be unacceptable to marry within one's village or for two siblings to marry partners from the same village.<ref>Dhavendra Kumar. ''Genetic Disorders of the Indian Subcontinent''. Kluwer Academic Publishers: AA Dordrecht, Netherlands, 2000. 127.</ref> The northern kinship model prevails in the states of [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Sikkim]], [[Tripura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], and [[West Bengal]]. However, for some communities in [[South India]], it is common for Hindu cross cousins to marry, with [[matrilateral]] [[cross-cousin]] (mother's brother's daughter) marriages being especially favored.<ref>W. H. R. Rivers. \"The Marriage of Cousins in India.\" Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. 1907.</ref> In the region, \"[[Avunculate marriage|uncle-niece]] and first-cousin unions are preferential and jointly account for some 30% of marriages\".<ref>Arthur P. Wolf, ''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo''\nThe State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', [[Stanford University Press]] (2005), p. 46''</ref>\n\nIn many North Indian communities, such as [[Brahmin]]s, [[Rajput]]s, [[Vaishya]]s, [[Jat]]s, [[Yadav]]s, everyone who is immediately associated with four surnames \u2014 own surname (that is father's surname), mother's maiden surname, paternal grandmother's maiden surname, maternal grandmother's maiden surname \u2014 falls outside the permissible marriage circle. These surnames are known as the candidate's ''[[gotra]]'' (lit. branch). Any two candidates who want to marry cannot have a common ''gotra''. The marriage is allowed only when all these ''shakha'' (branches) are different for both the candidates, so this automatically rules out closer cousin marriages. Cousin marriage is discouraged amongst Telugu Brahmins in Andhra Pradesh, such as Gauda and Dravida Brahmins.\n\nPractices in [[West India]] overall are closer to the northern than the southern,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|title=India - Marriage|website=countrystudies.us}}</ref> but differences exist here again. For instance, in [[Mumbai]], studies done in 1956 showed 7.7% of Hindus married to a second cousin or closer. By contrast, in the northern city of [[New Delhi]], only 0.1% of Hindus were married to a first cousin during the 1980s. At the other extreme, studies were done in the South Indian state of Karnataka, which contains [[Bangalore]], during that period show fully one-third of Hindus married to a second cousin or closer.<ref name=\"tables\" /> Pre-2000 Madhya Pradesh, from which Chhattisgarh has now split, and [[Maharashtra]], which contains Mumbai, are states that are intermediate in their kinship practices.\n\nIndia's Muslim minority represents about 14% of its population and has an overall rate of cousin marriage of 22% according to a 2000 report.  This may be a legacy of the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan, when substantial Muslim migration to [[Pakistan]] occurred from the eastern parts of the former unified state of Punjab. In south India, by contrast, the rates are fairly constant, except for the South Indian [[Malabar region|Malabar]] Muslims of Kerala (9%) who claim descent from Arab traders who settled permanently in India in the eighth century. Most Indian Muslims, by contrast, are the result of Hindus' [[Religious conversion|conversions]] to Islam in the 16th century or later. The lowest rate for a whole Indian region was in East India (15%). Consanguinity rates were generally stable across the four decades for which data exist, though second-cousin marriage appears to have been decreasing in favor of first-cousin marriage.\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]], cousin marriage is legal and common. Reasons for consanguinity are for economic, religious and cultural reasons.<ref>[[#Shaw|Shaw 2001]], p. 322</ref> Consanguineous marriage in Pakistan was reported to be higher than 60% of the population in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zahid|first=Muhammad|last2=Bittles|first2=Alan H.|last3=Sthanadar|first3=Aftab Alam|date=September 2014|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=46|issue=5|pages=698\u2013701|doi=10.1017/S0021932013000552|issn=1469-7599|title=Civil Unrest and the Current Profile of Consanguineous Marriage in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/23289/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=A.|date=1994|title=Comments on \"Consanguineous Marriages in Pakistan\"|journal=Pakistan Development Review|volume=33|issue=4 Pt 2|pages=675\u2013676|issn=0030-9729|pmid=12346200}}</ref>{{sfn|Shami|Schmitt|Bittles|1989}} In some areas, higher proportion of first-cousin marriages in Pakistan has been noted to be the cause of an increased rate of blood disorders in the population.{{sfn|Shami|Schmitt|Bittles|1989}}\n\n===United States===\nData on cousin marriage in the United States is sparse.

It gives the example of one mother, Mrs. Spring, whose daughter Kimberly Spring-Winters, 29, married her cousin Shane Winters, 37. She stated that when she has told people about her daughter's marriage, they have been shocked and that consequently she is afraid to mention it. They live in a small Pennsylvania town and she worries that her grandchildren will be treated as outcasts and ridiculed due to their parental status. Another cousin couple stated that their children's maternal grandparents have never met their two grandchildren because the grandparents severed contact out of disapproval for the couple's marriage. This couple withheld their names from publication.<ref name=\"kershaw\">{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Kershaw |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/garden/26cousins.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 |title = Shaking Off the Shame |date = 26 November 2009 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn most societies, cousin marriage apparently is more common among those of low socio-economic status, among the illiterate and uneducated, and in rural areas.<ref name=bittles1/> This may be due in part to the token or significantly reduced dowries and bridewealths that exist in such marriages and also the much smaller pool of viable marriage candidates in rural areas. Some societies also report a high prevalence among land-owning families and the ruling elite: here the relevant consideration is thought to be keeping the family estate intact over generations.<ref name=\"Bittles 1994, p. 567\"/> The average age at marriage is lower for cousin marriages, the difference in one Pakistani study being 1.10 and 0.84 years for first and second cousins, respectively. In Pakistan, the ages of the spouses were also closer together, the age difference declining from 6.5 years for unrelated couples to 4.5 years for first cousins. A marginal increase in time to first birth, from 1.6 years generally to 1.9 years in first cousins, may occur due to the younger age at marriage of consanguineous mothers and resultant adolescent subfertility or delayed consummation.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 570</ref>\n\nPredictions that cousin marriage would decline during the late 20th century in areas where it is preferential appear to have been largely incorrect. One reason for this is that in many regions, cousin marriage is not merely a cultural tradition, but is also judged to offer significant social and economic benefits. In South Asia, rising demands for [[dowry]] payments have caused dire economic hardship and have been linked to \"dowry deaths\" in a number of North Indian states. Where permissible, marriage to a close relative is hence regarded as a more economically feasible choice. Second, improvements in public health have led to decreased death rates and increased family sizes, making it easier to find a relative to marry if that is the preferred choice. Increases in cousin marriage in the West may also occur as a result of immigration from Asia and Africa. In the short term, some observers have concluded that the only new forces that could discourage such unions are government bans like the one China enacted in 1981. In the longer term, rates may decline due to decreased family sizes, making it more difficult to find cousins to marry.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 577</ref>\n\nCousin marriage is important in several anthropological theories by prominent authors such as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], [[Sir Edward Tylor]], and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. L\u00e9vi-Strauss viewed cross-cousin marriage as a form of exogamy in the context of a unilineal descent group, meaning either [[matrilineal]] or [[patrilineal]] descent. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage in societies with matrilineal descent meant that a male married into the family his mother's brother, building an [[alliance theory|alliance]] between the two families. However, marriage to a mother's sister daughter (a parallel cousin) would be [[endogamous]], here meaning inside the same descent group, and would therefore fail to build alliances between different groups. Correspondingly, in societies like China with patrilineal descent, marriage to a father's brother's daughter would fail at alliance building. And in societies with both types of descent, where a person belongs to the group of his mother's mother and father's father but not mother's father or father's mother, only cross-cousin marriages would successfully build alliances.<ref>Ottenheimer. p. 139.</ref>\n\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss postulated that cross-cousin marriage had the two consequences of setting up classes which automatically delimit the group of possible spouses and of determining a relationship that can decide whether a prospective spouse is to be desired or excluded. Whereas in other kinship systems one or another of these aspects dominates, in cross-cousin marriage they overlap and cumulate their effects. It differs from incest prohibitions in that the latter employs a series of negative relationships, saying whom one cannot marry, while cross-cousin marriage employs positive relationships, saying whom should marry. Most crucially, cross-cousin marriage is the only type of preferential union that can function normally and exclusively and still give every man and woman the chance to marry a cross-cousin. Unlike other systems such as the levirate, the sororate, or uncle-niece marriage, cross-cousin marriage is preferential because for obvious reasons these others cannot constitute the exclusive or even preponderant rule of marriage in any group. Cross-cousin marriage divides members of the same generation into two approximately equal groups, those of cross-cousins and \"siblings\" that include real siblings and parallel cousins. Consequently, cross-cousin marriage can be a normal form of marriage in a society, but the other systems above can only be privileged forms. This makes cross-cousin marriage exceptionally important.<ref>Elementary Structures of Kinship, Chapter 9, pp. 119\u201320</ref>\n\nCross-cousin marriage also establishes a division between prescribed and prohibited relatives who, from the viewpoint of biological proximity, are strictly interchangeable. L\u00e9vi-Strauss thought that this proved that the origin of the incest prohibition is purely social and not biological. Cross-cousin marriage in effect allowed the anthropologist to control for biological degree by studying a situation where the degree of prohibited and prescribed spouses were equal. In understanding why two relatives of the same biological degree would be treated so differently, L\u00e9vi-Strauss wrote, it would be possible to understand not only the principle of cross-cousin marriage but of the incest prohibition itself. For L\u00e9vi-Strauss cross-cousin marriage was not either socially arbitrary or a secondary consequence of other institutions like dual organization or the practice of exogamy. Instead, the ''raison d'etre'' of cross-cousin marriage could be found within the institution itself. Of the three types of institution of exogamy rules, dual organization, and cross-cousin marriage, the last was most significant, making the analysis of this form of marriage the crucial test for any theory of marriage prohibitions.<ref>Elementary Structures of Kinship, Chapter 9, p. 122</ref>\n\nMatrilateral cross-cousin marriage has been found by some anthropological researchers to be correlated with patripotestal jural authority, meaning rights or obligations of the father. According to some theories, in these kinship systems a man marries his matrilateral cross-cousin due to associating her with his nurturant mother. Due to this association, possibly reinforced by personal interaction with a specific cousin, he may become \"fond\" of her, rendering the relationship \"sentimentally appropriate\".<ref>{{cite book| title = Theory in anthropology: a source-book| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=q589AAAAIAAJ| year = 1968| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul Books| isbn = 978-0-7100-6172-0| pages = 105, 107| chapter = 10| editor1-last = Manners| first1 = Melford E| editor2-last = Kaplan| editor2-first = David| editor1-first = Robert Alan| last1 = Spiro }}</ref> ''Patrilateral'' cross-cousin marriage is the rarest of all types of cousin marriage, and there is some question as to whether it even exists.<ref>[[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], ''Les structures \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la parent\u00e9'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition.''</ref>\n\nIn contrast to L\u00e9vi-Strauss who viewed the exchange of women under matrilateral cross-cousin marriage as fundamentally egalitarian, anthropologist [[Edmund Leach]] held that such systems by nature created groups of junior and senior status and were part of the political structure of society. Under Leach's model, in systems where this form of marriage segregates descent groups into wife-givers and wife-takers, the social status of the two categories also cannot be determined by ''a priori'' arguments. Groups like the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] exhibiting matrilateral cross-cousin marriage do not exchange women in circular structures; where such structures do exist they are unstable. Moreover, the exchanging groups are not major segments of the society, but rather local descent groups from the same or closely neighboring communities. L\u00e9vi-Strauss held that women were always exchanged for some \"prestation\" which could either be other women or labor and material goods. Leach agreed but added that prestations could also take the form of intangible assets like \"prestige\" or \"status\" that might belong to either wife-givers or wife-takers.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach 1951]], pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nAnthropologists [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]] and [[Leonard Kasdan]] describe preferential parallel cousin marriage as leading to social fission, in the sense that \"feud and fission are not at all dysfunctional factors but are necessary to the persistence and viability of Bedouin society\". Their thesis is the converse of [[Fredrik Barth]]'s, who describes the fission as leading to the cousin marriage.<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], pp. 17\u201318</ref>  Per Murphy and Kasdan, the Arab system of parallel cousin marriage works against the creation of homogenous \"bounded\" and \"corporate\" kin groups and instead creates arrangements where every person is related by blood to a wide variety of people, with the degree of relationship falling off gradually as opposed to suddenly. Instead of corporate units, [[Arab]] society is described as having \"agnatic sections\", a kind of repeating fractal structure in which authority is normally weak at all levels but capable of being activated at the required level in times of war. They relate this to an old Arab proverb: \"Myself against my brother; my brother and I against my cousin; my cousin, my brother and I against the outsider.\"<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], pp. 19\u201320</ref> \"In such a society even the presence of a limited amount of cross-cousin marriage will not break the isolation of the kin group, for first cross cousins often end up being second parallel cousins.\"<ref>[[#Murphy|Murphy and Kasdan]], p. 22</ref> Instead of organizing horizontally through affinal ties, when large scale organization is necessary it is accomplished vertically, by reckoning distance from shared ancestors.

Also, Isaac's son [[Jacob]] married [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], both his cousins ({{bibleverse||Genesis|28\u201329|HE}}). Jacob's brother [[Esau]] also married his cousin [[Mahalath]], daughter of [[Ishmael]]. According to many English Bible translations, the five [[daughters of Zelophehad]] married the \"sons of their father's brothers\" in the later period of [[Moses]]; although other translations merely say \"relatives\". (For example, the Catholic [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]] and [[New American Bible|NAB]] differ in {{bibleverse||Numbers|36:10\u201312|NAB}}.) During the apportionment of Israel following the journey out of Egypt, [[Caleb]] gives his daughter [[Achsah]] to his brother's son [[Othniel Ben Kenaz|Othniel]] according to the NAB ({{bibleverse||Joshua|15:17|NAB}}), though the Jewish [[Talmud]] says Othniel was simply Caleb's brother (Sotah 11b). The daughters of Eleazer also married the sons of Eleazer's brother Kish in the still later time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|23:22|HE}}). [[King Rehoboam]] and his wives [[Maacah]] and [[Mahalath (wife of Rehoboam)|Mahalath]] were grandchildren of David ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:20|HE}}). Finally, according to the book of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], Tobias had a right to marry Sarah because he was her nearest kinsman (Tobit 7:10), though the exact degree of their cousinship is not clear.\n\n===Christianity===\nIn [[Roman Catholicism]], all marriages more distant than first-cousin marriages are allowed,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3X.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> and first-cousin marriages can be contracted with a [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]].<ref name=beal>John P.

Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press,  2000. 1293.</ref> This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, [[Emperor Constantine]], the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his half-brother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the [[Council of Agde]] in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the so-called [[Canon law|canon-law]] method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to ''sixth'' cousins, including by marriage. But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom, they were relaxed back to third cousins at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] in AD 1215. [[Pope Benedict XV]] reduced this to second cousins in 1917,<ref name=\"ottenheimer2\">\n{{cite book |title=Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth of Cousin Marriage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenrelativ00otte |chapter-url-access=registration |last=Ottenheimer |first=Martin |year=1996 |publisher=University of Illinois |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref> and finally, the current law was enacted in 1983.<ref name=beal/> In Catholicism, close relatives who have married unwittingly without a dispensation can receive an [[annulment]].\n\nThere are several explanations for the rise of Catholic cousin marriage prohibitions after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. One explanation is increasing [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence on church policy. G.E. Howard states, \"During the period preceding the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] invasion, speaking broadly, the church adhered to Roman law and custom; thereafter those of the Germans&nbsp;... were accepted.\"<ref>{{cite book |title = A History of Matrimonial Institutions |last = Howard |first = G.E. |year = 1904 |publisher = University of Chicago Press |page = 291 |volume = 1 |location = Chicago}}</ref> On the other hand, it has also been argued that the bans were a reaction ''against'' local Germanic customs of kindred marriage.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Development of the Family and Marriage in Europe |last = Goody |first = Jack |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |year = 1983 |page = 59}}</ref> At least one [[Franks|Frankish]] King, [[Pepin the Short]], apparently viewed close kin marriages among nobles as a threat to his power.<ref>{{cite book |first1 = Joseph |last1 = Gies |first2 = Frances |last2 = Gies |year = 1983 |title = Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages |publisher = Harper and Row |location = New York}}</ref> Whatever the reasons, written justifications for such bans had been advanced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] by the fifth century. \"It is very reasonable and just\", he wrote, \"that one man should not himself sustain many relationships, but that various relationships should be distributed among several, and thus serve to bind together the greatest number in the same social interests\".<ref name=ottenheimer3/> Taking a contrary view, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] writing after the [[Reformation]] tended to see the prohibitions and the dispensations needed to circumvent them as part of an undesirable church scheme to accrue wealth, or \"lucre\".<ref name=ottenheimer3>{{cite book |title=Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth of Cousin Marriage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenrelativ00otte |chapter-url-access=registration |last=Ottenheimer |first=Martin |year=1996 |publisher=University of Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5}}</ref>\n\nSince the 13th century the Catholic Church has measured consanguinity according to what is called, perhaps confusingly, the civil-law method. Under this method, the degree of relationship between lineal relatives (i.e., a man and his grandfather) is simply equal to the number of generations between them. However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree from one person, up to the common ancestor, and then back to the other person. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PC.HTM |title=Can. 108 |publisher=The Holy See |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115203405/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PC.HTM |archivedate=15 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches generally allow cousin marriage,<ref>Amy Strickland.

The [[Anglican Communion]] has also allowed cousin marriage since its inception during the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. According to Luther and Calvin, the Catholic bans on cousin marriage were an expression of Church rather than divine law and needed to be abolished. Protestants during the Reformation struggled to interpret the Biblical proscriptions against [[incest]] in a sensible manner, a task frustrated by facts like their omission of the daughter (but inclusion of the granddaughter) as a directly prohibited relation.<ref name=ottenheimer3/> John Calvin thought of the Biblical list only as illustrative and that any relationship of the same or smaller degree as any listed, namely the third degree by the civil-law method, should therefore be prohibited. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] reached the same conclusion soon after.<ref name=ottenheimer2/> But in contrast to both Protestantism and Catholicism, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] prohibits up to second cousins from marrying.<ref name=bittles1/> But, according to the latest constitution (of 2010) of The Orthodox Church of Cyprus, second cousins may marry as the restriction is placed up to relatives of the 5th degree [http://churchofcyprus.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KATASTATIKO_DIMOTIKI.pdf]. The reasoning is that marriage between close relatives can lead to intrafamily strife.

The percentage of consanguinity between any two individuals decreases fourfold as the [[most recent common ancestor]] recedes one generation. First cousins have four times the consanguinity of second cousins, while first cousins once removed have half that of first cousins. [[Double first cousins]] have twice that of first cousins and are as related as half-siblings.\n\nIn April 2002, the ''Journal of Genetic Counseling'' released a report which estimated the average risk of [[Congenital|birth defects]] in a child born of first cousins at 1.1\u20132.0 [[percentage points]] over an average base risk for non-cousin couples of 3%, or about the same as that of any woman over age 40.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/theres-nothing-wrong-with-cousins-getting-married-scientists-say-1210072.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=There's nothing wrong with cousins getting married, scientists say | first=Steve | last=Connor | date=24 December 2008 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> In terms of mortality, a 1994 study found a mean excess pre-reproductive mortality rate of 4.4%,<ref>{{cite web |title=A Background Background Summary of Consaguineous marriage |author=Bittles, A.H. |url=http://www.consang.net/images/d/dd/01AHBWeb3.pdf |publisher=consang.net consang.net |date=May 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2010}}, citing {{Cite journal |author1=Bittles, A.H. |author2=Neel, J.V. |year=1994 |title=The costs of human inbreeding and their implications for variation at the DNA level |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=8 |pages=117\u2013121|pmid=7842008  |doi = 10.1038/ng1094-117 |issue=2 |ref=harv |title-link=inbreeding }}</ref> while another study published in 2009 suggests the rate may be closer to 3.5%.<ref name=kershaw/> Put differently, a single first-cousin marriage entails a similar increased risk of birth defects and mortality as a woman faces when she gives birth at age 41 rather than at 30.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/theres-nothing-wrong-with-cousins-getting-married-scientists-say-1210072.html |title = There's nothing with cousins getting married, scientists say |newspaper = The Independent |first = Steve |last = Connor |date = 24 December 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nRepeated consanguineous marriages within a group are more problematic. After repeated generations of cousin marriage the actual genetic relationship between two people is closer than the most immediate relationship would suggest. In Pakistan, where there has been cousin marriage for generations and the current rate may exceed 50%, one study estimated infant mortality at 12.7 percent for married double first cousins, 7.9 percent for first cousins, 9.2 percent for first cousins once removed/double second cousins, 6.9 percent for second cousins, and 5.1 percent among nonconsanguineous progeny. Among double first cousin progeny, 41.2 percent of prereproductive deaths were associated with the expression of detrimental recessive genes, with equivalent values of 26.0, 14.9, and 8.1 percent for first cousins, first cousins once removed/double second cousins, and second cousins respectively.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 572, 574</ref>\n\nEven in the absence of preferential consanguinity, alleles that are rare in large populations can randomly increase to high frequency in small groups within a few generations due to the [[founder effect]] and accelerated [[genetic drift]] in a breeding pool of restricted size.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 572</ref> For example, because the entire [[Amish]] population is descended from only a few hundred 18th-century [[German-speaking Switzerland|German-Swiss]] settlers, the average coefficient of inbreeding between two random Amish is higher than between two non-Amish second cousins.<ref>[[#Hostetler|Hostetler 1963]], p. 330</ref> First-cousin marriage is taboo among Amish, but they still suffer from several rare genetic disorders.

However, these results may principally reflect village [[endogamy]] rather than consanguinity per se. Endogamy is marrying within a group and in this case the group was a village. The marital patterns of the Amish are also an example of endogamy.<ref name=\"BittlesBlack\">[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 6</ref>\n\nThe Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformation found an association between consanguinity and hydrocephalus, postaxial polydactyly, and bilateral oral and facial clefts. Another picture emerges from the large literature on congenital heart defects, which are conservatively estimated to have an incidence of 50/1,000 live births. A consistent positive association between consanguinity and disorders such as ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect has been demonstrated, but both positive and negative associations with patent ductus arteriosus, atrioventricular septal defect, pulmonary atresia, and [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] have been reported in different populations. Associations between consanguinity and Alzheimer's disease have been found in certain populations.<ref name=\"BittlesBlack\" /> Studies into the influence of inbreeding on anthropometric measurements at birth and in childhood have failed to reveal any major and consistent pattern, and only marginal declines were shown in the mean scores attained by consanguineous progeny in tests of intellectual capacity. In the latter case, it would appear that inbreeding mainly leads to greater variance in IQ levels, due in part to the expression of detrimental recessive genes in a small proportion of those tested.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 575</ref>\n\nA [[BBC]] report discussed [[British Pakistanis|Pakistanis in Britain]], 55% of whom marry a first cousin.<ref>Rowlatt, J, (2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4442010.stm \"The risks of cousin marriage\"], BBC Newsnight. Accessed 28 January 2007</ref> Given the high rate of such marriages, many children come from repeat generations of first-cousin marriages. The report states that these children are 13 times more likely than the general population to produce children with [[genetic disorder]]s, and one in ten children of first-cousin marriages in [[Birmingham]] either dies in infancy or develops a serious disability. The BBC also states that Pakistani-Britons, who account for some 3% of all births in the UK, produce \"just under a third\" of all British children with genetic illnesses. Published studies show that mean [[perinatal mortality]] in the Pakistani community of 15.7 per thousand significantly exceeds that in the indigenous population and all other ethnic groups in Britain. Congenital anomalies account for 41 percent of all British Pakistani infant deaths.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 576</ref> The BBC story contained an interview with Myra Ali, whose parents and grandparents were all first cousins. She has a very rare recessive genetic condition, known as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]] which will cause her to lead a life of extreme physical suffering, limited human contact and probably an early death from skin cancer. Knowing that cousin marriages increase the probability of recessive genetic conditions, she is understandably against the practice. Finally, in 2010 the Telegraph reported that cousin marriage among the British Pakistani community resulted in 700 children being born every year with genetic disabilities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7957808/700-children-born-with-genetic-disabilities-due-to-cousin-marriages-every-year.html|title=700 children born with genetic disabilities due to cousin marriages every year|first=Rebecca|last=Lefort|date=22 August 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe increased mortality and birth defects observed among British Pakistanis may, however, have another source besides current consanguinity. This is [[Wahlund effect|population subdivision]] among different Pakistani groups. Population subdivision results from decreased gene flow among different groups in a population. Because members of Pakistani ''biradari'' have married only inside these groups for generations, offspring have higher average [[homozygosity]] even for couples with no known genetic relationship.<ref>[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 5</ref> According to a statement by the UK's [[Human Genetics Commission]] on cousin marriages, the BBC also \"fails to clarify\" that children born to these marriages were not found to be 13 times more likely to develop genetic disorders. Instead they are 13 times more likely to develop ''recessive'' genetic disorders. The HGC states, \"Other types of genetic conditions, including chromosomal abnormalities, sex-linked conditions and autosomal dominant conditions are not influenced by cousin marriage.\" The HGC goes on to compare the biological risk between cousin marriage and increased maternal age, arguing that \"Both represent complex cultural trends. Both however, also carry a biological risk. They key difference, GIG argue, is that cousin marriage is more common amongst a British minority population.\"<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023095407/http://www.hgc.gov.uk/Client/Content.asp?ContentId=741 \"Statement on cousins who marry\"], Human Genetics Commission. Accessed 1 November 2009</ref> Genetic effects from cousin marriage in Britain are more obvious than in a developing country like Pakistan because the number of confounding environmental diseases is lower. Increased focus on genetic disease in developing countries may eventually result from progress in eliminating environmental diseases there as well.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 579</ref>\n\nComprehensive genetic education and premarital genetic counseling programs can help to lessen the burden of genetic diseases in endogamous communities. Genetic education programs directed at high-school students have been successful in Middle Eastern countries such as [[Bahrain]]. Genetic counseling in developing countries has been hampered, however, by lack of trained staff, and couples may refuse prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion despite the endorsement of religious authorities.<ref>[[#Consanguinity|Bittles and Black, 2009]], Section 4</ref> In Britain, the Human Genetics Commission recommends a strategy comparable with previous strategies in dealing with increased maternal age, notably as this age relates to an increased risk of Down Syndrome. All pregnant women in Britain are offered a screening test from the government-run national health service to identify those at an increased risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. The HGC states that similarly, it is appropriate to offer genetic counseling to consanguineous couples, preferably before they conceive, in order to establish the precise risk of a genetic abnormality in offspring. Under this system the offering of genetic counseling can be refused, unlike, for example, in the US state of Maine where genetic counseling is mandatory to obtain a marriage license for first cousins. Leading researcher Alan Bittles also concluded that though consanguinity clearly has a significant effect on childhood mortality and genetic disease in areas where it is common, it is \"essential that the levels of expressed genetic defect be kept in perspective, and to realize that the outcome of consanguineous marriages is not subject to assessment solely in terms of comparative medical audit\".<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 578</ref> He states that the social, cultural, and economic benefits of cousin marriage also need to be fully considered.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1994]], p. 793</ref>\n\n===Fertility===\n\nHigher total fertility rates are reported for cousin marriages than average, a phenomenon noted as far back as [[George Darwin]] during the late 19th century. There is no significant difference in the number of surviving children in cousin marriages because this compensates for the observed increase in child mortality.<ref>[[Cousin marriage#=Reproductive|Bittles 1994]], p. 790</ref> The total fertility increase may be partly explained by the lower average parental age at marriage, and age at first birth, observed in consanguineous marriages. Other factors include shorter birth intervals and possibly a lower likelihood of using reliable [[contraception]].<ref name=bittles1/> There is also the possibility of more births as a compensation for increased child mortality, either via a conscious decision by parents to achieve a set family size or the cessation of [[lactational amenorrhea]] following the death of an infant.<ref>[[#Role|Bittles 1994]], p. 571</ref> According to a recent paper the fertility difference is probably not due to any underlying biological effect.<ref>{{citation |title = Consanguineous marriage and differentials in age at marriage, contraceptive use and fertility in Pakistan |first1 = R. |first2 = A.H. |last1 = Hussein |last2 = Bittles |year = 1999 |publisher = Journal of Biosocial Science |pages = 121\u2013138 |url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=hbspapers}}</ref> In Iceland, where marriages between second and third cousins were common, in part due to limited selection, studies show higher fertility rates.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140855.htm Third Cousins Have Greatest Number Of Offspring, Data From Iceland Shows], Science Daily, 7 February 2008</ref> Earlier papers claimed that increased sharing of [[human leukocyte antigen]]s, as well as of deleterious recessive genes expressed during pregnancy, may lead to lower rates of conception and higher rates of miscarriage in consanguineous couples.
