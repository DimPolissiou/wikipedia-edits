tenures in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), where he worked as a wrestler and [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. \n\nMartin held a dozen championships between ECW, WCW, and the WWF and is a five-time [[Professional wrestling

He gained attention when he won a [[NWA World Title Tournament|tournament]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, where he publicly rejected the NWA title belt and helped ECW in evolving from an NWA territory to a nationwide phenomenon. Within ECW, he was dubbed \"The Franchise\" in reference to his status as the [[franchise player]] of the promotion. WWE, who purchased that organization, asserted: \"Without Shane Douglas, there would have been no ECW.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/shane-douglas|title=Shane Douglas biography|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> He headlined many [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|events]] for the ECW including three editions of the company's premier [[pay-per-view]] event [[November to Remember]] in [[November to Remember (1996)|1996]], [[November to Remember (1997)|1997]] and [[November to Remember (1998)|1998]].\n\n==Early life==\nMartin was born in [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]], one of six children of a veteran of [[World War II]], who died in 1991.<ref name=Franchise/> He graduated ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' from [[Bethany College (Bethany, West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in 1986 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[history]] and [[political science]].<ref name=Franchise/> He is an alumnus of the Psi chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psibeta.net/rollviewer.htm|title=Shane Douglas' (Troy Martin's) roll number|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607005432/http://www.psibeta.net/rollviewer.htm|archivedate=2009-06-07}}</ref> After earning his degrees, he was offered to join the [[Saba University School of Medicine]]<ref name=Franchise/> but declined in order to continue wrestling.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early years (1982\u20131989)===\nMartin was trained by [[Dominic DeNucci]] in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], alongside [[Mick Foley]] in the mid-1980s.<ref>Mick Foley.

Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.92)</ref> In 1986, he wrestled [[Randy Savage]] at a ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' taping using his real name. He also wrestled \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the debut episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'', once again using his real name. Later that year, he began wrestling as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] for the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF) using the name Shane Douglas,<ref name=\"encyclopedia271\">{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/271 271]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref> which was given to him by [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|\"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Missy Hyatt]] (the \"Douglas\" last name was inspired by [[Michael Douglas]], who at the time had just appeared in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''). Douglas defeated Gilbert for the [[UWF Television Championship]] on August 3, 1987, but did not rise above mid-card status. Douglas soon lost the title on September 2 to [[Terry Taylor]].\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1989\u20131990)===\nEventually, he signed with the [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). He retained his Shane Douglas ring name and was put into a [[tag team]] of [[Skateboarding|skateboarders]] known as The Dynamic Dudes with [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]] (John Laurinaitis, the younger brother of [[Road Warrior Animal]]).<ref name=WCWbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/franchise/|title=WCW profile|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817233028/http://www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/franchise|archivedate=August 17, 2000}}</ref><ref name=mick156>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (pp. 156, 187)</ref>\n\nMick Foley has opined that since neither Ace nor Douglas knew how to skateboard, the fans saw through the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|character]] and refused to buy into it.<ref name=mick156/> [[Jim Cornette]], who was managing [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] ([[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Stan Lane]]) at the time, decided to manage the duo to help them [[Over (professional wrestling)|get over]].<ref name=\"https\">{{cite web |last1=Jim Cornette's Talking Sense |title=Jim Cornette on Why The Dynamic Dudes Gimmick Was Doomed From the Start |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_VU2UEHMOA |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen Eaton and Lane [[Kayfabe|in storyline]] did not approve, they forced a match between the two teams with Cornette remaining neutral at ringside. He ended up turning on Douglas and Ace and the teams [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] for a couple of months. Cornette's turn was to have established The Dynamic Dudes as a top fan favorite tag team, but the turn backfired and made [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] more popular than they already were.<ref name=\"https\"/>\n\nThe Dynamic Dudes broke up in 1990 after Ace began competing progressively more for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), which was breaking its ties to the NWA. Jim Cornette also states that the end of the Dynamic Dudes came when Douglas went over his head to Jim Herd about having a finish changed to make him look stronger. Cornette, who was part of the booking committee, washed his hands of working with them afterwards.  Shane argued that they had been repeatedly promised a big push and were instead being booked to lose all of their big matches, then getting criticized for not getting over as a top team. The Dudes would last wrestle together in March 1990, and Douglas soon left WCW and wrestled on the American [[independent circuit]].<ref name=\"https\"/> <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1990\u20131991)===\nIn 1990, Douglas signed a deal with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and made his debut on the June 18 episode of [[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]], defeating Bob Bradley, in a match taped in Toronto, Ontario on May 27.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm</ref> Douglas remained undefeated in his first month, defeating Bob Bradley, [[Paul Diamond]], and [[Steve Lombardi]] in a series of matches. He then moved up to begin a house show series in late June against [[Haku (wrestler)|Haku]] and suffered his first loss on June 28 in Denver, CO. He remained without a win in subsequent rematches. He made his televised debut on the promotion's flagship show [[WWF Superstars]] on the August 26 Summerslam pre-show, teaming with Mark Thomas in a loss to [[The Orient Express]]. \n\nIn August 1991 he received his first break when he was tapped as the temporary replacement to an injured [[Shawn Michaels]] in [[The Rockers]] tag-team. Douglas teamed with Jannette six times in matches against The Orient Express. On August 27 he made his PPV debut, defeating [[Buddy Rose]] in a dark match at [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam '90]]. On the September 17 episode of Prime Time Wrestling Douglas wrestled Haku to a draw, and he was largely undefeated against low level competition throughout the fall. At the [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series '90]] Douglas defeated Buddy Rose in another dark match, and on January 3rd, 1991 at a house show in Scranton, PA he scored the biggest victory of his nascent WWF career when he upset [[Dino Bravo]]. <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm</ref> Four days later on the January 7th, 1991 episode of Prime Time Wrestling he would pin Haku, and was strongly positioned as a rising young star. \n\nHis most memorable WWF performance took place at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991 Royal Rumble]], where he entered as the 17th entrant and lasted for 26 minutes and 23 seconds before being eliminated by [[Brian Knobbs]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble2.html#91|title=Royal Rumble 1991 entrances and eliminations|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-01}}</ref> This was the seventh longest time for any wrestler in the Royal Rumble's first four years.

Carluzzo, a high-ranking NWA official, apparently was talking about a show Shane no showed because he was worried about pay. The promoter kept backing out of parts of the agreement and in the end wanted Shane to drive instead of fly as was planned in the arrangement.

In a career spanning four seasons, his performances in handicaps and top class company, including victory in the 1969 [[Eclipse Stakes]], established him as a talented racehorse without being exceptional. He would achieve greater success as a stallion whereupon retiring to stud where he became [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|Champion Sire]] in Britain.\n\n==Background==\n\nBy Sovereign Path and out of Cygnet, Wolver Hollow was sold as a yearling, fetching 4,000 guineas<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, 14. The Times Digital Archive (accessed April 3, 2020).</ref> Sovereign Path, rated 125 by [[Timeform]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=701}}</ref> was successful in the 1959 [[Tetrarch Stakes]] as well as the 1960 renewals of the [[Lockinge Stakes]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]. As a sire, he produced sixteen crops of racehorses, the most notable of which was [[Humble Duty]]. Nevertheless, he also counted multiple big race winners among his progeny including Town Crier ([[Queen Anne Stakes]]), Supreme Sovereign ([[Lockinge Stakes]]) and Spanish Express ([[Middle Park Stakes]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=936}}</ref>. While Wolver Hollow's dam Cygnet, by undefeated champion racehorse [[Caracalla (horse)|Caracalla]], did not hail from an immediately prolific family, her third dam, Sunshot, was the granddam of classic winners Resplendent (1926 [[Irish Oaks]] and dam of [[Windsor Lad]]) and Sol Speranza who won the same two classics in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1943 |title=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |url= |journal=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |volume=32 |issue= |pages=73 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> Alongside Wolver Hollow, Cygnet produced nine other foals including Gaybrook Swan, second in the 1970 [[Northern Dancer Turf Stakes|Niagara Handicap]] and Tall Dream, runner up in both the [[Vincent O'Brien National Stakes|National Stakes]] and [[Beresford Stakes]] of 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloodstockreports.co.uk/weatherbys/wbr/orderreports/orderReportParameters.jsp?listSection=FR&listSectionName=Free%20Reports&countryCode=GB&optNo=79&priceId=1 |title=Weatherbys Bloodstock Reports |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://galopp-sieger.de/galoppsieger/pferd_html?pschl=Tall%20DreamTamerlane |title=Gallop Sieger |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1966: two-year-old season===\nWolver Hollow made his debut in the 1966 New Stakes, now known as the [[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|Norfolk Stakes]], at Ascot where he finished four lengths behind the Johnson Houghton trained Falcon.<ref>FROM OUR RACING CORRESPONDENT. \"Fighting Charlie falters but wins easily.\" Times, June 17, 1966, 5.</ref> On his second start, he finished behind Falcon again when fourth in the [[National Stakes (Sandown Park)|National Stakes]] at Sandown<ref>\"Sandown Park Details\" Times, 21 July 1966, p. 5.</ref> - a course incidentally where Falcon would win the following season's [[Temple Stakes]]. Wolver Hollow would then be unplaced at Kempton before rounding off the season finishing fourth of thirteen starters in the [[Dewhurst Stakes]] behind the next season's English and Irish Derby third Dart Board.\n\n===1967: three-year-old season===\nNewbury would be Wolver Hollow's first port of call in 1967 where he would contest the [[Greenham Stakes]], a traditional trial for the [[2000 Guineas]]. Finishing third by a neck and a head, this was the closest he had come to shedding his maiden tag. However, it was not the strongest Guineas trial given that neither of the front two were entered for the classic.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Classic horses not impressive.\" Times, April 24, 1967, 12.</ref> While it transpired to be useful form, (the runner up,[[Reform (horse)|Reform]], would become the leading miler of the season), Wolver Hollow started at an unfancied 40/1 when finishing unplaced on his next start in the Guineas.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Royal Palace beats milers at their own game.\" Times, May 4, 1967, 13.</ref> Returning to the Royal Ascot meeting where he made his debut the previous year, Wolver Hollow again ran into Reform finishing just under a length and a half fourth in the [[St James's Palace Stakes]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Steeple Aston can go one better in Hunt Cup.\" Times, 21 June 1967, p. 11.</ref> At the Goodwood meeting, Wolver Hollow entered handicap company with a reasonable fifth under second top-weight, giving a pound to Irish Derby runner up Sucaryl and six pounds to [[Falmouth Stakes]] winner Resilience.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Hopes vanish as Caergwrle heads for Midhurst.\" Times, 29 July 1967, p. 14.</ref> A step down in class a month later facilitated Wolver Hollow finally losing his maiden tag as he won the ten furlong Virginia Stakes at Newcastle. While the contest was effectively a maiden race, Wolver Hollow only had to be shaken up to win by four lengths.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Northern Racing.\" Times, August 29, 1967, 11.</ref> Little over a week later, Wolver Hollow doubled his tally with success in the one mile Crathorne Sweepstakes at York. There he faced three rivals;- Worthy Friend, a long priced outsider, [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] also-ran Scottish Sinbad who won a handicap at the same Newcastle meeting where Wolver Hollow was victorious, and [[Queen Anne Stakes]] runner up Arenaria who was in receipt of ten pounds.<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Scottish Sinbad is best choice.\" Times, 7 Sept. 1967, p. 14.</ref> Scottish Sinbad made the running but was closely tracked by Wolver Hollow under a motionless Edward Hide who sent his mount home inside the final furlong to win by a length and a half with Arenaria a further two lengths behind. After the race, he was given a 25/1 quote for the [[Cambridgeshire Handicap]].<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, p. 14.</ref> In preparation for the Cambridgeshire, Wolver Hollow contested the Wavertree Stakes at Newmarket but was unable to complete a hat-trick, finishing a length and three quarters behind easy [[Nassau Stakes]] winner Fair Winter.<ref>\"Saturday's racing results\" Times, September 18, 1967, p. 11.</ref> Wolver Hollow capped off his season with a two and a half length third in the Cambridgeshire off 8st 12lb behind [[Irish 1,000 Guineas]] winner Lacquer<ref>\"Saturday's racing results\" Times, September 28, 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===1968: four-year-old season===\nWolver Hollow made four racecourse appearances in 1968 although the first was not until August when he participated in two races at the Deauville summer festival. The first appearance came when fourth in the [[Prix Gontaut-Biron]] won by Frontal - himself fourth in the previous season's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. On ground considered too soft for him, he was squeezed out of third by a head by Grandier who went on to win a [[Prix d'Ispahan]] and a [[Prix Ganay]] as well as finish third in a [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Rehearsal for Hopeful Venture.\" Times, 26 Aug. 1968, p. 12.</ref> Nine days later, Wolver Hollow ventured into calmer waters when winning the Prix Ridgway from Right Honourable and Atopolis. <ref>PAR, R. R. \"\" WOLVER HOLLOW \"REMPORTE LE PRIX RIDGWAY.\" Le Monde, 28 Aug. 1968.</ref> After a scheduled run at Newbury was cancelled following the abandonment of the meeting, Wolver Hollow's next run was in the [[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]<ref>\"Racing Results.\" Times, 16 Sept. 1968, p. 12.</ref>. The absences of [[2000 Guineas]] third Jimmy Reppin and [[Irish Derby]] runner up Ribofilio notwithstanding, the field still featured [[Sussex Stakes]] runner up World Cup, [[Prix Jean Prat]] victor Lorenzaccio and [[Greenham Stakes]] winner Heathen.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Lorenzaccio can hold off World Cup.\" Times, September 28, 1968, p. 6.</ref> The race, ran on soft ground, was contested between World Cup and Wolver Hollow up the straight with the former eventually winning by four easy lengths with Lorenzaccio a further three lengths behind in third.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"World Cup Scores Despite Rumours.\" The Observer, Sep 29, 1968.</ref> Wolver Hollow's season would culminate once again in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, this time shouldering top weight of 9st 8lbs. Next in the weights was [[Diadem Stakes]] winner Secret Ray on 9st 6lbs, [[Jersey Stakes]] third Paddy Me on 9st 4lbs, the same weight as previous year's runner up Straight Master while [[Yorkshire Oaks]] winner Exchange, carrying 9st, was sent off favourite.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Sir Ivor has stamina to win 'Champion'.\" Times, 19 Oct. 1968, p. 7.</ref> Wolver Hollow ran a career best to finish second, going down by a neck to Emirilo despite conceding twenty-seven pounds.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Great win for Sir Ivor at Newmarket.\" Times, 21 Oct. 1968, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===1969: five-year-old season===\n[[Henry Cecil|Henry Cecil's]] first season as a racehorse trainer would be spearheaded by Wolver Hollow's final season as a racehorse. His reappearance came in the Mark Lane Jubilee Stakes, a ten furlong handicap over ten furlongs on very soft ground. There he faced a stiff task sitting on top of the handicap conceding upwards of seven pounds to winners of the [[Rosebery Stakes]] and the [[City and Suburban Handicap]] along with the previous year's winner.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Wolver Hollow can survive stern test.\" Times, May 10, 1969, 6.</ref> In the event, bottom weight Sovereign Ruler won by a facile eight lengths and would go on to win two and twice finish placed in valuable handicaps through the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=671}}</ref> Wolver Hollow finished runner up while conceding thirty-five pounds to the well handicapped winner and was very much considered a contender going into the [[Lockinge Stakes]] on his next start.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Jimmy Reppin may take Lockinge Stakes.\" Times, 31 May 1969, p. 6.</ref> However, he would finish a tailed off last of six behind [[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]] and subsequently underwent a dope test.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Lockinge Goes to Habitat.\" The Observer, Jun 01, 1969. P. 21.</ref> Wolver Hollow's penultimate start came at Royal Ascot in the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]] where he would be ridden by [[Lester Piggot]] for the first time. Here he faced four rivals in the shape of [[Noel Murless|Noel Murless's]] top class [[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]], [[Epsom Derby]] also-ran Stoned and a couple of high class handicappers.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Prince Tenderfoot may be too fast for rivals.\" Times, 17 June 1969, p. 13.</ref> Class told with Connaught making all to win by five lengths ahead of Wolver Hollow, with stoned a further two lengths behind in third.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Double for Barclay.\" Times, June 18, 1969, 13.</ref> Wolver Hollow's career would be defined by his final start in the [[Eclipse Stakes]] where he would also be the last horse to carry his owner's colours.<ref name=\"auto1\">BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Big Prize for Last Runner.\" The Observer (1901- 2003), Jul 06, 1969, p. 19.</ref> Coughing forced Connaught and Ribofilio (Irish Derby second) to miss their engagement while the useful Remand was withdrawn leaving seven runners to face the starter at Sandown. High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight.

His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow.

Other horses of note include Reach, winner of the 1984 [[Royal Lodge Stakes]], Festive Cheer, third in the 1991 [[Phoenix Stakes]], Treasure Hope, winner of the 1992 [[Premio Regina Elena]] (Italian 1000 Guineas), and Wrapping, a runner up in the 1989 [[Oaks d'Italia]]. Wolver Hollow was also the damsire of several useful [[National Hunt]] horses such as Simply Dashing, a high class handicap chaser who finished second in a [[Charlie Hall Chase]], 1992 [[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]] winner Thetford Forest and useful handicapper Latent Talent. \n\nHe was euthanised due to deteriorating health on 13 June 1987.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pedigreequery.com/wolver+hollow|title=Wolver Hollow Horse Pedigree|website=www.pedigreequery.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable progeny===\n\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" font-size:80%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Foaled'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Name'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Dam'''\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Sex'''\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| '''Major Wins and Notable Performances'''\n|-\n| 1971\n| Charlie Bubbles\n| Sixandahalf\n| c\n| 1st [[Hardwicke Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| [[Furry Glen]]\n| Cleftess\n| c\n| 1st [[Marble Hill Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Leopardstown Stakes|Mullion Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Irish 2000 Guineas]] (1974) 1st [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Whitehall Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Vauxhall Trial Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Gallinule Stakes]] (1974) 3rd [[Coventry Stakes]] (1973) 3rd Larkspur Stakes (1973) \n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| Wanlockhead\n| Exultation\n| c\n| 3rd [[Gordon Richards Stakes|Westbury Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| [[Wollow]]\n| Wichuraiana\n| c\n| 1st [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Dewhurst Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Greenham Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[2000 Guineas]] (1976) 1st [[Eclipse Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[Sussex Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[International Stakes|Benson & Hedges Gold Cup]] (1976)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| Wolverlife\n| Miralife\n| c\n| 3rd [[Duke of York Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Palace House Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Diamond Jubilee Stakes|Cork and Orrery Stakes]]\n|-\n|-\n| 1975\n| My Hollow\n| Saucy Mine\n| f\n| 1st [[Royal Whip Stakes]] (1980) 1st [[Desmond Stakes]] (1980) 2nd [[Blandford Stakes]] (1980)\n|-\n|-\n| 1976\n| Galaxy Libra\n| Garden of Eden\n| c\n| 1st [[Man o' War Stakes]] (1981) 2nd [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes]] (1981) 3rd [[Charles Whittingham Stakes|Hollywood Invitational Handicap]] (1981) 3rd [[Washington, D.C.

High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight. She ran into the heels of the pacemaking Rocked two furlongs out, and after making her way round that horse she found her way blocked by the Italian Derby winner Hogarth. By the time she had moved out to come round Hogarth on the wide outside she had no chance of catching Wolver Hollow: she had used up most of her energy finding a way through, and courage wasn't enough to win her the prize.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=510}}</ref> Park Top would win the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] next time under Lester Piggot, confirming that she was superior to her Sandown showing. Nevertheless, Wolver Hollow's win was enough to secure a new career as a stallion.\n\n==Races==\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\" text-align:centre; margin-left:1em; float:centre ;border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%\"\n|-  style=\"background:#dacaa4; text-align:center;\"\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Finish'''\n!'''Race'''\n!'''Dist'''\n!'''Jockey'''\n!'''Winner/Runner up '''\n!'''Track'''\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|06|16}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|New Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|07|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[National_Stakes_(Sandown_Park)|National Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|09|17}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|Imperial Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">6</span>6f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Heath Rose\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|10|14}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Dewhurst Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Dart Board\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|04|22}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Greenham Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Play High\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|05|03}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|[[2000 Guineas Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Doug Smith  (jockey)|Doug Smith ]]\n|[[Royal_Palace_(horse)|Royal Palace]]\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|06|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[St James's Palace Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[George Moore (jockey)|George Moore]]\n|[[Reform (horse)|Reform]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|07|28}}\t\n|5th\n|News of the World Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sucaryl\n|[[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|08|28}}\t\n|1st\n|Virginia Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Future Fame\n|[[Newcastle Racecourse|Newcastle]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|07}}\t\n|1st\n|Crathorne Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Scottish Sinbad\n|[[York Racecourse|York]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|16}}\t\n|3rd\n|Wavertree Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Fair Winter\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|10|21}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Lacquer\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|17}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Prix Gontaut-Biron]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Frontal\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|26}}\t\n|1st\n|Prix Ridgway\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Right Honourable\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|9|28}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|World Cup\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|10|19}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Emerilo\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|10}}\t\n|2nd\n|Jubilee Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sovereign Ruler\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|31}}\t\n|6th\n|[[Lockinge Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|[[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]]\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|6|17}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Prince of Wales's Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|7|5}}\t\n|1st\n|[[Eclipse Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Park Top]]\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Stud career==\nWhen owner [[Hope Goddard Iselin]] retired at the age of 102, the horses she still had in training were sent to be sold at Newmarket.

His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow. Indeed, Wollow's earnings were such that they eclipsed the \u00a3166,323 earned by the progeny of [[Vaguely Noble]], that season's second leading sire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=825}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, this would represent the zenith of Wolver Hollow's stallion career and while he would produce a further handful of useful horses, none of whom would win at the highest level. \n\nAs a damsire, Wolver Hollow could not count any European Group One winners among his descendants although Love A Show was victorious in the 1983 [[Blue Diamond Stakes]]. Other horses of note include Reach, winner of the 1984 [[Royal Lodge Stakes]], Festive Cheer, third in the 1991 [[Phoenix Stakes]], Treasure Hope, winner of the 1992 [[Premio Regina Elena]] (Italian 1000 Guineas), and Wrapping, a runner up in the 1989 [[Oaks d'Italia]]. Wolver Hollow was also the damsire of several useful [[National Hunt]] horses such as Simply Dashing, a high class handicap chaser who finished second in a [[Charlie Hall Chase]], 1992 [[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]] winner Thetford Forest and useful handicapper Latent Talent. \n\nHe was euthanised due to deteriorating health on 13 June 1987.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pedigreequery.com/wolver+hollow|title=Wolver Hollow Horse Pedigree|website=www.pedigreequery.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable progeny===\n\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" font-size:80%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Foaled'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Name'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Dam'''\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Sex'''\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| '''Major Wins and Notable Performances'''\n|-\n| 1971\n| Charlie Bubbles\n| Sixandahalf\n| c\n| 1st [[Hardwicke Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| [[Furry Glen]]\n| Cleftess\n| c\n| 1st [[Marble Hill Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Leopardstown Stakes|Mullion Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Irish 2000 Guineas]] (1974) 1st [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Whitehall Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Vauxhall Trial Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Gallinule Stakes]] (1974) 3rd [[Coventry Stakes]] (1973) 3rd Larkspur Stakes (1973) \n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| Wanlockhead\n| Exultation\n| c\n| 3rd [[Gordon Richards Stakes|Westbury Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| [[Wollow]]\n| Wichuraiana\n| c\n| 1st [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Dewhurst Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Greenham Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[2000 Guineas]] (1976) 1st [[Eclipse Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[Sussex Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[International Stakes|Benson & Hedges Gold Cup]] (1976)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| Wolverlife\n| Miralife\n| c\n| 3rd [[Duke of York Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Palace House Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Diamond Jubilee Stakes|Cork and Orrery Stakes]]\n|-\n|-\n| 1975\n| My Hollow\n| Saucy Mine\n| f\n| 1st [[Royal Whip Stakes]] (1980) 1st [[Desmond Stakes]] (1980) 2nd [[Blandford Stakes]] (1980)\n|-\n|-\n| 1976\n| Galaxy Libra\n| Garden of Eden\n| c\n| 1st [[Man o' War Stakes]] (1981) 2nd [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes]] (1981) 3rd [[Charles Whittingham Stakes|Hollywood Invitational Handicap]] (1981) 3rd [[Washington, D.C.

The line notably ran through [[Lake Wales, Florida|Lake Wales]], [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], [[Sebring, Florida|Sebring]], and [[Immokalee, Florida|Immokalee]] and would stretch as far south as [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]] upon its completion in 1928. Everglades City would be the southernmost point the entire Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system would ever reach.  The Haines City Branch was one of the Atlantic Coast Line's major additions to its Florida network, much of which was previously part of the [[Plant System]].<ref name=\"Turner1\">{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gregg|title=A Short History of Florida Railroads|date=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Atlantic Coast Line Railroad began construction on the Haines City Branch in 1910, with its initial route running from the main line in Haines City south 47 miles to Sebring.  This segment would be complete in June 1912 and served many vegetable and citrus growers.<ref name=\"Turner2\">{{cite book| last =Turner | first =Gregg M. | title =Railroads of Southwest Florida | publisher =Arcadia Publishing | series =Images of America | date =December 1, 1999}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lake Placid FL depot museum01.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Placid passenger depot, built in 1926]]\nIn 1916, the Atlantic Coast Line made plans to extend the branch further south to [[Immokalee, Florida|Immokalee]].  Construction began that year with track reaching the [[Caloosahatchee River]] at [[Ortona, Glades County, Florida|Ortona]] by April 1918.  This project also included a branch from Harrisburg, just south of [[Palmdale, Florida|Palmdale]], to [[Moore Haven, Florida|Moore Haven]] which was completed around the same time.  Harrisburg was named after the Harris track-laying machine used to construct the line.  The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad would then charter the '''Moore Haven & Clewiston Railway''' to extend the Moore Haven Branch southeast a short distance to [[Clewiston, Florida|Clewiston]], which would be complete in 1921.  The [[U.S. Sugar]] Corporation would be a major customer on the line in Clewiston.  The branch would be extended one last time in 1929 to the [[Miami Canal]] in [[Lake Harbor, Florida|Lake Harbor]] to connect with the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]'s Kissimmee Valley Branch.  A spur south and east to [[Okeelanta, Florida|Okeelanta]] would also be built.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\nIn 1919, construction resumed on the main route from Ortona south.  Track was built from Ortona south across the [[Caloosahatchee River]] through Goodno, Sears, and [[Felda, Florida|Felda]] to Immokalee.  The first train to Immokalee arrived on October 16, 1921.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\n[[File:Everglades City FL Depot01.jpg|thumb|left|Former Everglades City passenger depot.  This would be the Atlantic Coast Line's southernmost passenger depot.]]\nShortly after service to Immokalee began, the Atlantic Coast Line's President [[Henry Walters]] authorized one last extension of the line south to [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]].  The Atlantic Coast Line accomplished this extension by purchasing the [[Deep Lake Railroad]] from [[Barron Collier]], the namesake of [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]].  The Deep Lake Railroad was built in 1913 and transported lumber and grapefruit from Deep Lake to Everglades City.  Collier acquired the Deep Lake Railroad in 1921.  The Atlantic Coast Line then extended track south from Immokalee to Deep Lake and rebuilt the Deep Lake Railroad.  The line was completed in 1928 and a passenger depot was built in Everglades City (known then as simply Everglades), which would be the farthest south the Atlantic Coast Line would ever reach.<ref name=\"Turner2\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Deep Lake - Depth of Water & History|url=https://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/historyculture/deep-lake.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>  The Haines City Branch would only serve Everglades city until 1957 when the Atlantic Coast Line cut the line back to Sunniland, just south of Immokalee.<ref name=\"Turner2\" /> \n\nIn 1925, the Atlantic Coast Line would lose its monopoly in communities on the northern half of the Haines City Branch when the Atlantic Coast Line's competitor, the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]], built the [[Florida Western and Northern Railroad]] through [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]], [[Lake Wales, Florida|West Lake Wales]], [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], and [[Sebring, Florida|Sebring]].  The Seaboard line paralleled the Haines City Branch to the west through much of southern Central Florida, and the lines crossed each other just south of Avon Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=ACL Haines City Branch |url=http://tampabaytrains.com/aclHainesCityBranchTrains.htm |website=Tampa Bay Trains |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Turner1\" />  The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads would merge in 1967, with the merged company being named the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]]. \n\nThe Seaboard Coast Line ended up using the former Seaboard Air Line track in the combined network as the main route through the area.  The Haines City Branch would then be broken up into smaller branches of the Seaboard line.  Track was removed between Waverly and Lake Wales, between Frostproof and Avon Park (with a short piece of the line remaining as a spur), and between the Avon Park spur and Sebring (which eliminated the crossing of the two lines).  The Seaboard Coast Line would then operate the north end of the line as their Haines City Subdivision from Haines City to Waverly.  Track from Lake Wales to Frostproof became part of the Lake Wales Subdivision.  Remaining track south of Sebring to Lake Harbor became the Sebring Subdivision, and track from Harrisburg to Immokalee became the Immokalee Subdivision.<ref name=\"SCL 1977\">[http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/SCL/SCL%20ETTs/SCL%20Jville%20%26%20Tampa%20Divs%20ETT%20%238%2010-30-1977.pdf Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977)]</ref>\n \nIn 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the [[Chessie System]], creating the [[CSX Corporation]].

The line notably ran though [[Lake Wales, Florida|Lake Wales]], [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], [[Sebring, Florida|Sebring]], and [[Immokalee, Florida|Immokalee]] and would stretch as far south as [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]] upon its completion in 1928. Everglades City would be the southernmost point the entire Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system would ever reach.  The Haines City Branch was one of the Atlantic Coast Line's major additions to its Florida network, much of which was previously part of the [[Plant System]].<ref name=\"Turner1\">{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gregg|title=A Short History of Florida Railroads|date=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Atlantic Coast Line Railroad began construction on the Haines City Branch in 1910, with its initial route running from the main line in Haines City south 47 miles to Sebring.  This segment would be complete in June 1912 and served many vegetable and citrus growers.<ref name=\"Turner2\">{{cite book| last =Turner | first =Gregg M. | title =Railroads of Southwest Florida | publisher =Arcadia Publishing | series =Images of America | date =December 1, 1999}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lake Placid FL depot museum01.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Placid passenger depot, built in 1926.]]\nIn 1916, the Atlantic Coast Line made plans to extend the branch further south to [[Immokalee, Florida|Immokalee]].  Construction began that year with track reaching the [[Caloosahatchee River]] at [[Ortona, Glades County, Florida|Ortona]] by April 1918.  This project also included a branch from Harrisburg, just south of [[Palmdale, Florida|Palmdale]], to [[Moore Haven, Florida|Moore Haven]] which was completed around the same time.  Harrisburg was named after the Harris track-laying machine used to construct the line.  The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad would then charter the '''Moore Haven & Clewiston Railway''' to extend the Moore Haven Branch southeast a short distance to [[Clewiston, Florida|Clewiston]], which would be complete in 1921.  The [[U.S. Sugar]] Corporation would be a major customer on the line in Clewiston.  The branch would be extended one last time in 1929 to the [[Miami Canal]] in [[Lake Harbor, Florida|Lake Harbor]] to connect with the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]'s Kissimmee Valley Branch.  A spur south and east to [[Okeelanta, Florida|Okeelanta]] would also be built.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\nIn 1919, construction resumed on the main route from Ortona south.  Track was built from Ortona south across the [[Caloosahatchee River]] through Goodno, Sears, and [[Felda, Florida|Felda]] to Immokalee.  The first train to Immokalee arrived on October 16, 1921.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\n[[File:Everglades City FL Depot01.jpg|thumb|left|Former Everglades City passenger depot.  This would be the Atlantic Coast Line's southernmost passenger depot.]]\nShortly after service to Immokalee began, the Atlantic Coast Line's President [[Henry Walters]] authorized one last extension of the line south to [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]].  The Atlantic Coast Line accomplished this extension by purchasing the [[Deep Lake Railroad]] from [[Barron Collier]], the namesake of [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]].  The Deep Lake Railroad was built in 1913 and transported lumber and grapefruit from Deep Lake to Everglades City.  Collier acquired the Deep Lake Railroad in 1921.  The Atlantic Coast Line then extended track south from Immokalee to Deep Lake and rebuilt the Deep Lake Railroad.  The line was completed in 1928 and a passenger depot was built in Everglades City (known then as simply Everglades), which would be the farthest south the Atlantic Coast Line would ever reach.<ref name=\"Turner2\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Deep Lake - Depth of Water & History|url=https://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/historyculture/deep-lake.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>  The Haines City Branch would only serve Everglades city until 1957 when the Atlantic Coast Line cut the line back to Sunniland, just south of Immokalee.<ref name=\"Turner2\" /> \n\nIn 1925, the Atlantic Coast Line would lose its monopoly in communities on the northern half of the Haines City Branch when the Atlantic Coast Line's competitor, the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]], built the [[Florida Western and Northern Railroad]] through [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]], [[Lake Wales, Florida|West Lake Wales]], [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], and [[Sebring, Florida|Sebring]].  The Seaboard line paralleled the Haines City Branch to the west though much of southern Central Florida, and the lines crossed each other just south of Avon Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=ACL Haines City Branch |url=http://tampabaytrains.com/aclHainesCityBranchTrains.htm |website=Tampa Bay Trains |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Turner1\" />  The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads would merge in 1967, with the merged company being named the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]]. \n\nThe Seaboard Coast Line ended up using the former Seaboard Air Line track in the combined network as the main route through the area.  The Haines City Branch would then be broken up into smaller branches of the Seaboard line.  Track was removed between Waverly and Lake Wales, between Frostproof and Avon Park (with a short piece of the line remaining as a spur), and between the Avon Park spur and Sebring (which eliminated the crossing of the two lines).  The Seaboard Coast Line would then operate the north end of the line as their Haines City Subdivision from Haines City to Waverly.  Track from Lake Wales to Frostproof became part of the Lake Wales Subdivision.  Remaining track south of Sebring to Lake Harbor became the Sebring Subdivision, and track from Harrisburg to Immokalee became the Immokalee Subdivision.<ref name=\"SCL 1977\">[http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/SCL/SCL%20ETTs/SCL%20Jville%20%26%20Tampa%20Divs%20ETT%20%238%2010-30-1977.pdf Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977)]</ref>\n \nIn 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the [[Chessie System]], creating the [[CSX Corporation]].  The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into [[CSX Transportation]].
