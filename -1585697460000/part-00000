This treatment alone is not wholly effective, and many people still experience other symptoms like lung disease and noninfectious inflammatory symptoms.\n\n<!-- History and epidemiology -->\nCVID was first diagnosed over 60 years ago, and since has emerged as the predominant class of primary antibody deficiencies. CVID is formally diagnosed by levels of IgG and IgA more than two standard deviations below the norm, and no other cause for [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], an abnormally low level of immunoglobulins in the blood. It is thought to affect between 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nThe symptoms of CVID vary between people affected. Its main features are [[hypogammaglobulinemia]] and recurrent infections. Hypogammaglobulinemia manifests as a significant decrease in the levels of [[IgG]] antibodies, usually alongside [[IgA]] antibodies; [[IgM]] antibody levels are also decreased in about half of people.<ref name=Herriot2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herriot R, Sewell WA |title=Antibody deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=994\u20131000 |year=2008 |pmid=18755724 |doi=10.1136/jcp.2007.051177 |url=}}</ref> Infections are a direct result of the low antibody levels in the circulation, which do not adequately protect them against pathogens. The microorganisms that most frequently cause infections in CVID are bacteria [[Haemophilus influenzae]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] and [[Staphylococcus aureus]]. Pathogens less often isolated from people include [[Neisseria meningitidis]], [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] and [[Giardia lamblia]]. Infections mostly affect the respiratory tract (nose, sinuses, bronchi, lungs) and the ears; they can also occur at other sites, such as the eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. These infections respond to antibiotics but can recur upon discontinuation of antibiotics. [[Bronchiectasis]] can develop when severe, recurrent pulmonary infections are left untreated.\n\nIn addition to infections, people with CVID can develop complications. These include:\n* autoimmune manifestations, e.g. [[pernicious anemia]], [[autoimmune haemolytic anemia]] (AHA), [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP), [[psoriasis]], [[vitiligo]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], primary [[hypothyroidism]], [[atrophic gastritis]]. Autoimmunity is the main type of complication in people with CVID, appearing in some form in up to 50% of individuals;\n* malignancies, particularly [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[gastric carcinoma]];\n* enteropathy, which manifests with a blunting of [[intestinal villi]] and inflammation, and is usually accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal cramps, diarrhea, constipation and, in some cases, malabsorption and weight loss. Symptoms of CVID enteropathy are similar to those of [[celiac disease]], but don't respond to a gluten-free diet. Infectious causes must be excluded before a diagnosis of enteropathy can be made, as people with CVID are more susceptible to intestinal infections, e.g. by [[Giardia lamblia]];\n* lymphocytic infiltration of tissues, which can cause enlargement of lymph nodes ([[lymphadenopathy]]), of the spleen ([[splenomegaly]]) and of the liver ([[hepatomegaly]]), as well as the formation of [[granulomas]].  In the lung this is known as [[Granulomatous\u2013lymphocytic interstitial lung disease]].\n\nAnxiety and depression can occur as a result of dealing with the other symptoms.<ref>Sanger, David E.

For example, serum immunoglobulin levels in people with CVID vary greatly. Generally, people can be grouped as follows: no immunoglobulin production, immunoglobulin (Ig) M production only, or both normal IgM and IgG production.<ref name=\"CVID diagnosis\" /> Additionally, B cell numbers are also highly variable. 12% of people have no detectable B cells, 12% have reduced B cells, and 54% are within the normal range.<ref name=\"Update in Understanding\" /> In general, people with CVID display higher frequencies of [[naive B cell]]s and lower frequencies of class-switched [[memory B cells]]. Frequencies of other B cell populations, such as IgD [[memory B cells]], [[transitional B cells]], and [[CD21]] B cells, are also affected, and are associated with specific disease features. Although CVID is often thought of as a serum immunoglobulin and B cell-mediated disease, T cells can display abnormal behavior. Affected individuals typically present with low frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>, a T-cell marker, and decreased circulation of [[regulatory T cells]] and [[Natural killer T cell|iNKT cell]]. Notably, approximately 10% of people display CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts lower than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; this particular phenotype of CVID has been named LOCID (Late Onset Combined Immunodeficiency), and has a poorer prognosis than classical CVID.\n\n===Types===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, the disease is defined by [[T cell]] defects, namely reduced proliferative capacity.<ref name=\"CVID\">{{cite journal|last1=Strober|first1=Warren|last2=Chua|first2=Kevin|title=Common Variable Immunodeficiency|journal=Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology|date=2000|volume=19|issue=2|pages=157\u2013181|doi=10.1385/criai:19:2:157|pmid=11107500|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236299}}</ref> The disease is hard to diagnose, taking on average 6\u20137 years after onset.<ref name=\"CVID diagnosis\" />\n<ref name=\"many faces of CVID\">{{cite journal|last1=Resnick|first1=Elena S.|last2=Cunningham-Rundles|first2=Charlotte|title=The many faces of the clinical picture of common variable immune deficiency|journal=Current Opinion|date=2012|volume=12|issue=6|pages=595\u2013601|doi=10.1097/aci.0b013e32835914b9|pmid=23026770}}</ref> CVID is a [[primary immunodeficiency]].<ref name=\"CVID diagnosis\">{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Jordan K.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Erwin W.|title=Common Variable Immunodeficiency: Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment|journal=Immunol Allergy Clin N Am|date=2015|volume=35|issue=4|pages=637\u2013658|doi=10.1016/j.iac.2015.07.009|pmid=26454311}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nTreatment options are limited, and usually include lifelong [[immunoglobulin]] replacement therapy.<ref name=\"many faces of CVID\" /> This therapy is thought to help reduce bacterial infections. This treatment alone is not wholly effective, and many people still experience other symptoms like lung disease and noninfectious inflammatory symptoms.\n\n<!-- History and epidemiology -->\nCVID was first diagnosed over 60 years ago, and since has emerged as the predominant class of primary antibody deficiencies. CVID is formally diagnosed by levels of IgG and IgA more than two standard deviations below the norm, and no other cause for [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], an abnormally low level of immunoglobulins in the blood. It is thought to affect between 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nThe symptoms of CVID vary between people affected. Its main features are [[hypogammaglobulinemia]] and recurrent infections. Hypogammaglobulinemia manifests as a significant decrease in the levels of [[IgG]] antibodies, usually alongside [[IgA]] antibodies; [[IgM]] antibody levels are also decreased in about half of people.<ref name=Herriot2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herriot R, Sewell WA |title=Antibody deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=994\u20131000 |year=2008 |pmid=18755724 |doi=10.1136/jcp.2007.051177 |url=}}</ref> Infections are a direct result of the low antibody levels in the circulation, which do not adequately protect them against pathogens. The microorganisms that most frequently cause infections in CVID are bacteria [[Haemophilus influenzae]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] and [[Staphylococcus aureus]]. Pathogens less often isolated from people include [[Neisseria meningitidis]], [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] and [[Giardia lamblia]]. Infections mostly affect the respiratory tract (nose, sinuses, bronchi, lungs) and the ears; they can also occur at other sites, such as the eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. These infections respond to antibiotics but can recur upon discontinuation of antibiotics. [[Bronchiectasis]] can develop when severe, recurrent pulmonary infections are left untreated.\n\nIn addition to infections, people with CVID can develop complications. These include:\n* autoimmune manifestations, e.g. [[pernicious anemia]], [[autoimmune haemolytic anemia]] (AHA), [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP), [[psoriasis]], [[vitiligo]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], primary [[hypothyroidism]], [[atrophic gastritis]]. Autoimmunity is the main type of complication in people with CVID, appearing in some form in up to 50% of individuals;\n* malignancies, particularly [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[gastric carcinoma]];\n* enteropathy, which manifests with a blunting of [[intestinal villi]] and inflammation, and is usually accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal cramps, diarrhea, constipation and, in some cases, malabsorption and weight loss. Symptoms of CVID enteropathy are similar to those of [[celiac disease]], but don't respond to a gluten-free diet. Infectious causes must be excluded before a diagnosis of enteropathy can be made, as people with CVID are more susceptible to intestinal infections, e.g. by [[Giardia lamblia]];\n* lymphocytic infiltration of tissues, which can cause enlargement of lymph nodes ([[lymphadenopathy]]), of the spleen ([[splenomegaly]]) and of the liver ([[hepatomegaly]]), as well as the formation of [[granulomas]].  In the lung this is known as [[Granulomatous\u2013lymphocytic interstitial lung disease]].\n\nAnxiety and depression can occur as a result of dealing with the other symptoms.<ref>Sanger, David E.

For example, serum immunoglobulin levels in people with CVID vary greatly. Generally, people can be grouped as follows: no immunoglobulin production, immunoglobulin (Ig) M production only, or both normal IgM and IgG production.<ref name=\"CVID diagnosis\" /> Additionally, B cell numbers are also highly variable. 12% of people have no detectable B cells, 12% have reduced B cells, and 54% are within the normal range.<ref name=\"Update in Understanding\" /> In general, people with CVID display higher frequencies of [[naive B cell]]s and lower frequencies of class-switched [[memory B cells]]. Frequencies of other B cell populations, such as IgD [[memory B cells]], [[transitional B cells]], and [[CD21]] B cells, are also affected, and are associated with specific disease features. Although CVID is often thought of as a serum immunoglobulin and B cell-mediated disease, T cells can display abnormal behavior. Affected individuals typically present with low frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>, a T-cell marker, and decreased circulation of [[regulatory T cells]] and [[Natural killer T cell|iNKT cell]]. Notably, approximately 10% of people display CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts lower than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; this particular phenotype of CVID has been named LOCID (Late Onset Combined Immunodeficiency), and has a poorer prognosis than classical CVID.\n\n===Types===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

 \n \nIdaho Falls serves as the commercial, cultural, and healthcare hub for eastern Idaho, as well as parts of western Wyoming and southern Montana. It is served by the [[Idaho Falls Regional Airport]] and is home to the [[College of Eastern Idaho]], [[Museum of Idaho]], and the [[Idaho Falls Chukars]] minor league baseball team. It is the principal city of the Idaho Falls [[Idaho Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and the Idaho Falls-Blackfoot, Idaho [[Combined Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TaylorsBridge-1.jpg|thumb|left|Taylor's Bridge, c.1870]]\n\n===Montana Trail origins===\nThe area around Idaho Falls was first sparsely settled by cattle and sheep ranchers. No significant development took place until 1864, when a man named Harry Rickets built and operated a ferry on the [[Snake River]] at {{Coord|43|36.112|N|112|3.528|W}}. The ferry served a new tide of westward migration and travel on the [[Montana Trail]] following the [[Bear River Massacre]] of [[Shoshone]] Indians in 1863.<ref name=\"MD Beal 1942, p. 218\">MD Beal, A History of Southeastern Idaho, 1942, p. 218.</ref><ref name=\"MD Beal 1942, p. 218\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference+Series/0071.pdf|title=idahohistory.net|website=Idahohistory.net|access-date=25 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928132319/http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference+Series/0071.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2017|df=}}</ref> The present-day site of Idaho Falls became a permanent settlement when freighter [[James Madison Taylor|Matt Taylor]] built a timber-frame toll bridge across a narrow black basaltic gorge of the river {{convert|7|mi|km}} downstream from the ferry. The bridge improved travel for settlers moving north and west, and for miners, freighters, and others seeking riches in the gold fields of [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]\u2014especially the boom towns of [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]].\n\n===Eagle Rock===\n[[File:UandN Bridge Eagle Rock.jpg|thumb|left|Utah & Northern Bridge, c.1880, looking north, or upriver, with railroad shops in background.]]\n\nBy the end of 1865, a private bank, small hotel, [[livery stable]], eating house, post office, and stage station had sprung up near the bridge. The settlement was initially known as '''Taylor's Crossing''', but postmarks indicate that by 1866, the emerging town had become known as '''Eagle Rock'''.  The name was derived from an isolated basalt island in the Snake River near the ferry, where approximately twenty eagles nested.\n\nIn 1874, [[water rights]] were established on nearby [[Willow Creek (Snake River)|Willow Creek]] and the first grain was harvested. Settlement was sparse and consisted of only a couple of families and small irrigation ditches. The first child of European descent was born at Eagle Rock in 1874.\n\nSoon, the [[Utah and Northern Railway]] (U&NR) was built, stretching north from [[Utah]] through Eagle Rock and crossing the Snake River at the same narrow gorge as Taylor's bridge.  The railway would eventually connect to the large new copper mines at [[Butte, Montana]]. The U&NR had the backing of robber baron [[Jay Gould]], as [[Union Pacific Railroad]] had purchased it a few years prior.<ref>Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, 1981, pp 31-39.</ref>  Grading crews reached Eagle Rock in late 1878, and by early 1879, a wild camp-town with dozens of tents and shanties had moved to Eagle Rock with a collection of saloons, dance halls, and gambling halls. The railroad company had 16 locomotives and 300 train cars working between [[Logan, Utah]] at the once-quiet stage stop. A new iron railroad bridge was fabricated in [[Athens, Pennsylvania]] at a cost of $30,000 and shipped by rail to the site, where it was erected in April and May 1879.<ref>Deseret News, 1879-07-17 p. article \"Utah and Northern\" describes the scene at Eagle Rock and describes the new railroad bridge</ref> The bridge was {{convert|800|ft|m}} long and had two spans, with an island in the center. The camp-town moved on, but Eagle Rock now had regular train service and several U&NR buildings, shops, and facilities, which expanded and transformed the town.\n\nAs soon as the railroad came through, settlers began [[Homestead Act|homesteading]] the [[Snake River Plain|Upper Snake River Valley]] in earnest. The first new settlers carved out homesteads to the north at Egin (near present-day [[Parker, Idaho|Parker]]) and at Pooles Island (near present-day [[Menan, Idaho|Menan]]).<ref>The Snake River Fork County, Louis J. Clements and Harold S. Forbush, 1972 pp 25-27.</ref> The Utah & Northern Railway provided easy access, especially to homesteaders from Utah, who soon populated much of the areas surrounding Eagle Rock. Some of these men had initially worked building the railroad, then later returned with their families to stake out new farms. These Utah families brought irrigation know-how developed in Utah's Great Basin settlements. Through their and others' canal systems, water from the Snake River made the Upper Snake River Valley into one of the most successful irrigation projects in the Mountain West.<ref>Pioneer Pathways, vol. VIII, International Society Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 2005 pp 312-318.</ref>  Large-scale settlement ensued and within a decade, there appeared roads, bridges, and dams, which brought most of the Upper Snake River Valley under [[Tillage|cultivation]].\n\nIn 1887, following the construction of the [[Oregon Short Line]] and a railroad workers' strike in Eagle Rock, most of the railroad facilities were moved to [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], where the new line branched off the U&NR. This caused a sharp and immediate drop in population, which nearly killed the town. In 1891, in an effort to attract farmers wary of eagles and rocks, marketers convinced town leaders to change the name to '''Idaho Falls''', in reference to the rapids below the bridge. Some years later, the construction of a retaining wall for a hydroelectric power plant enhanced the rapids into falls. In 1895, the world's then-largest irrigation canal, the Great Feeder, began diverting water from the Snake River, helping to convert tens of thousands of more acres of desert into green farmland. The area grew [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, peas, grains, and [[alfalfa]], and became one of the most productive regions of the United States. The city once again began to flourish, growing continuously into the 20th century.\n\n===Nuclear reactors===\n[[File:Sl-1-ineel81-3966.jpg|thumb|left|upright|SL-1 reactor core in Idaho Falls following a 1961 accident that killed three people]]\n[[File:Idaho National Lab CAES.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Idaho National Lab CAES|The Idaho National Laboratory, the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, and the University of Wyoming have labs, classrooms, offices, and other facilities just north of downtown.

There have been more than 50 unique nuclear reactors built at the facility for testing, although only three currently remain active.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nNRTS was the scene of the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in U.S. history, on January 3, 1961. The event occurred at an experimental U.S. Army reactor plant known as the Argonne Low Power Reactor, which the Army called the [[Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One]] (SL-1). Due to poor design and maintenance procedures, a single control rod was manually pulled out too far from the reactor, causing the reactor to become [[prompt critical]], and leading to a destructive power excursion. Three military, trained men had been working inside the reactor room when a mistake was made while reattaching a control rod to its motor assembly.<ref name=\"Tucker\">{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Todd |title=Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History |isbn=978-1-4165-4433-3 |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/atomicamericahow00todd }} See summary: [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0904/2008013842-s.html]</ref> With the central control rod nearly fully extended, the nuclear reactor rated at 3 MW rapidly increased power to 20 GW.

It is the principal city of the Idaho Falls [[Idaho Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and the Idaho Falls-Blackfoot, Idaho [[Combined Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TaylorsBridge-1.jpg|thumb|left|Taylor's Bridge, c.1870]]\n\n===Montana Trail origins===\nThe area around Idaho Falls was first sparsely settled by cattle and sheep ranchers. No significant development took place until 1864, when a man named Harry Rickets built and operated a ferry on the [[Snake River]] at {{Coord|43|36.112|N|112|3.528|W}}. The ferry served a new tide of westward migration and travel on the [[Montana Trail]] following the [[Bear River Massacre]] of [[Shoshone]] Indians in 1863.<ref name=\"MD Beal 1942, p. 218\">MD Beal, A History of Southeastern Idaho, 1942, p. 218.</ref><ref name=\"MD Beal 1942, p. 218\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference+Series/0071.pdf|title=idahohistory.net|website=Idahohistory.net|access-date=25 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928132319/http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference+Series/0071.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2017|df=}}</ref> The present-day site of Idaho Falls became a permanent settlement when freighter [[James Madison Taylor|Matt Taylor]] built a timber-frame toll bridge across a narrow black basaltic gorge of the river {{convert|7|mi|km}} downstream from the ferry. The bridge improved travel for settlers moving north and west, and for miners, freighters, and others seeking riches in the gold fields of [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]\u2014especially the boom towns of [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]].\n\n===Eagle Rock===\n[[File:UandN Bridge Eagle Rock.jpg|thumb|left|Utah & Northern Bridge, c.1880, looking north, or upriver, with railroad shops in background.]]\n\nBy the end of 1865, a private bank, small hotel, [[livery stable]], eating house, post office, and stage station had sprung up near the bridge. The settlement was initially known as '''Taylor's Crossing''', but postmarks indicate that by 1866, the emerging town had become known as '''Eagle Rock'''.  The name was derived from an isolated basalt island in the Snake River near the ferry, where approximately twenty eagles nested.\n\nIn 1874, [[water rights]] were established on nearby [[Willow Creek (Snake River)|Willow Creek]] and the first grain was harvested. Settlement was sparse and consisted of only a couple of families and small irrigation ditches. The first child of European descent was born at Eagle Rock in 1874.\n\nSoon, the [[Utah and Northern Railway]] (U&NR) was built, stretching north from [[Utah]] through Eagle Rock and crossing the Snake River at the same narrow gorge as Taylor's bridge.  The railway would eventually connect to the large new copper mines at [[Butte, Montana]]. The U&NR had the backing of robber baron [[Jay Gould]], as [[Union Pacific Railroad]] had purchased it a few years prior.<ref>Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, 1981, pp 31-39.</ref>  Grading crews reached Eagle Rock in late 1878, and by early 1879, a wild camp-town with dozens of tents and shanties had moved to Eagle Rock with a collection of saloons, dance halls, and gambling halls. The railroad company had 16 locomotives and 300 train cars working between [[Logan, Utah]] at the once-quiet stage stop. A new iron railroad bridge was fabricated in [[Athens, Pennsylvania]] at a cost of $30,000 and shipped by rail to the site, where it was erected in April and May 1879.<ref>Deseret News, 1879-07-17 p. article \"Utah and Northern\" describes the scene at Eagle Rock and describes the new railroad bridge</ref> The bridge was {{convert|800|ft|m}} long and had two spans, with an island in the center. The camp-town moved on, but Eagle Rock now had regular train service and several U&NR buildings, shops, and facilities, which expanded and transformed the town.\n\nAs soon as the railroad came through, settlers began [[Homestead Act|homesteading]] the [[Snake River Plain|Upper Snake River Valley]] in earnest. The first new settlers carved out homesteads to the north at Egin (near present-day [[Parker, Idaho|Parker]]) and at Pooles Island (near present-day [[Menan, Idaho|Menan]]).<ref>The Snake River Fork County, Louis J. Clements and Harold S. Forbush, 1972 pp 25-27.</ref> The Utah & Northern Railway provided easy access, especially to homesteaders from Utah, who soon populated much of the areas surrounding Eagle Rock. Some of these men had initially worked building the railroad, then later returned with their families to stake out new farms. These Utah families brought irrigation know-how developed in Utah's Great Basin settlements. Through their and others' canal systems, water from the Snake River made the Upper Snake River Valley into one of the most successful irrigation projects in the Mountain West.<ref>Pioneer Pathways, vol. VIII, International Society Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 2005 pp 312-318.</ref>  Large-scale settlement ensued and within a decade, there appeared roads, bridges, and dams, which brought most of the Upper Snake River Valley under [[Tillage|cultivation]].\n\nIn 1887, following the construction of the [[Oregon Short Line]] and a railroad workers' strike in Eagle Rock, most of the railroad facilities were moved to [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], where the new line branched off the U&NR. This caused a sharp and immediate drop in population, which nearly killed the town. In 1891, in an effort to attract farmers wary of eagles and rocks, marketers convinced town leaders to change the name to '''Idaho Falls''', in reference to the rapids below the bridge. Some years later, the construction of a retaining wall for a hydroelectric power plant enhanced the rapids into falls. In 1895, the world's then-largest irrigation canal, the Great Feeder, began diverting water from the Snake River, helping to convert tens of thousands of more acres of desert into green farmland. The area grew [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, peas, grains, and [[alfalfa]], and became one of the most productive regions of the United States. The city once again began to flourish, growing continuously into the 20th century.\n\n===Nuclear reactors===\n[[File:Sl-1-ineel81-3966.jpg|thumb|left|upright|SL-1 reactor core in Idaho Falls following a 1961 accident that killed three people]]\n[[File:Idaho National Lab CAES.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Idaho National Lab CAES|The Idaho National Laboratory, the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, and the University of Wyoming have labs, classrooms, offices, and other facilities just north of downtown.

There have been more than 50 unique nuclear reactors built at the facility for testing, although only three currently remain active.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nNRTS was the scene of the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in U.S. history, on January 3, 1961. The event occurred at an experimental U.S. Army reactor plant known as the Argonne Low Power Reactor, which the Army called the [[Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One]] (SL-1). Due to poor design and maintenance procedures, a single control rod was manually pulled out too far from the reactor, causing the reactor to become [[prompt critical]], and leading to a destructive power excursion. Three military, trained men had been working inside the reactor room when a mistake was made while reattaching a control rod to its motor assembly.<ref name=\"Tucker\">{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Todd |title=Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History |isbn=978-1-4165-4433-3 |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/atomicamericahow00todd }} See summary: [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0904/2008013842-s.html]</ref> With the central control rod nearly fully extended, the nuclear reactor rated at 3 MW rapidly increased power to 20 GW.

When both parents carry one defective [[gene]], each of their children faces one in four chance of developing NCL. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting just one copy of the defective gene. Individuals who have only one defective gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not develop the disease, but they can pass the gene on to their own children. The most commonly identified mutations are in the ''[[CLN3]]'' gene. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p12.1). The normal function of the gene is not presently known but is a transmembrane protein.\n\nAdult NCL may be inherited as an [[autosomal recessive]] (Kufs) or, less often, as an [[autosomal dominant]] (Parry's) disorder. In [[autosomal dominant]] [[inheritance]], all people who inherit a single copy of the disease gene develop the disease. As a result, there are no unaffected carriers of the [[gene]].\n\nMany authorities refer to the NCLs collectively as Batten disease.<ref name=\"NIH\">{{cite web |title=Batten Disease Fact Sheet {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Batten-Disease-Fact-Sheet |website=www.ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause vision loss is often an early sign, Batten disease/NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of Batten disease/NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often an eye specialist or other physician who suspects Batten disease/NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. In order to diagnose Batten disease/NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.\n\nDiagnostic tests used for Batten disease/NCLs include:\n\n*Skin or tissue sampling. The doctor can examine a small piece of tissue under an [[electron microscope]]. The powerful magnification of the microscope helps the doctor spot typical NCL deposits. These deposits are found in many different tissues, including [[skin]], [[muscle]], [[conjunctiva]], [[rectal]] and others. Blood can also be used.{{citation needed|reason=A clinician is unlikely to make use of an electron microscope; the inclusions are often easily seen using light microscopy|date=November 2008}} These deposits take on characteristic shapes, depending on the variant under which they are said to occur: granular osmophilic deposits (GRODs) are generally characteristic of INCL, while [[curvilinear]] profiles, fingerprint profiles, and mixed-type inclusions are typically found in LINCL, JNCL, and ANCL, respectively.\n*[[Electroencephalogram]] or EEG. An EEG uses special patches placed on the scalp to record electrical currents inside the brain. This helps doctors see telltale patterns in the brain's electrical activity that suggest a patient has [[seizures]].\n*Electrical studies of the eyes. These tests, which include [[visual-evoked response]]s (VER) and [[Electroretinography|electroretinogram]]s (ERG), can detect various eye problems common in childhood Batten disease/NCLs.\n*Brain scans. Imaging can help doctors look for changes in the brain's appearance. The most commonly used imaging technique is [[computed tomography]] (CT), which uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. A second imaging technique that is increasingly common is [[magnetic resonance imaging]], or MRI. MRI uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain.\n*Enzyme assay. A recent development in diagnosis of Batten disease/NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] [[enzyme]]s for infantile and late infantile only. This is a quick and easy diagnostic test.\n\n=== Types===\n\nThe older classification of NCL divided the condition into four types (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and CLN4) based upon age of onset, while newer classifications divide it by the associated gene.<ref name=\"pmid15965709\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mole SE, Williams RE, Goebel HH |title=Correlations between genotype, ultrastructural morphology and clinical phenotype in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses |journal=Neurogenetics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=107\u201326 |date=September 2005 |pmid=15965709 |doi=10.1007/s10048-005-0218-3}}</ref><ref>{{OMIM|256730}}</ref>\n\nCLN4 (unlike CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) has not been mapped to a specific gene.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''Type''' || '''Description''' || '''[[OMIM]]''' || '''Gene'''\n |- \n | Type 1 || '''Infantile NCL''' ([[Santavuori\u2013Haltia disease]], INCL): begins between about 6 months and 2 years of age and progresses rapidly.

Brineura is administered into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).<ref name=\"fda.gov\">https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm555613.htm?ftag=MSF0951a18|accessdate=30 April 2017</ref>\n\n====Juvenile form====\nAll mutations resulting in the Juvenile variant of NCL have been shown to occur at the CLN3 gene on 16p12;<ref name=no13/> of the mutations known to cause JNCL, 85% result from a 1.02 kb deletion, with a loss of amino acids 154\u2013438, while the remaining 15% appear to result from either point or [[frameshift mutation]]s.<ref name=no14/> The wild type CLN3 gene codes for a protein with no known function;<ref name=no12/> however, studies of the yeast CLN3 [[ortholog]], the product of which is called [[Battenin]] (after its apparent connections to Batten\u2019s Disease, or JNCL), have suggested that the protein may play a role in lysosomal [[pH]] [[homeostasis]].

When both parents carry one defective [[gene]], each of their children faces one in four chance of developing NCL. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting just one copy of the defective gene. Individuals who have only one defective gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not develop the disease, but they can pass the gene on to their own children. The most commonly identified mutations are in the ''[[CLN3]]'' gene. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p12.1). The normal function of the gene is not presently known but is a transmembrane protein.\n\nAdult NCL may be inherited as an [[autosomal recessive]] (Kufs) or, less often, as an [[autosomal dominant]] (Parry's) disorder. In [[autosomal dominant]] [[inheritance]], all people who inherit a single copy of the disease gene develop the disease. As a result, there are no unaffected carriers of the [[gene]].\n\nMany authorities refer to the NCLs collectively as Batten disease.<ref name=\"NIH\">{{cite web |title=Batten Disease Fact Sheet {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Batten-Disease-Fact-Sheet |website=www.ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause vision loss is often an early sign, Batten disease/NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of Batten disease/NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often an eye specialist or other physician who suspects Batten disease/NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. In order to diagnose Batten disease/NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.\n\nDiagnostic tests used for Batten disease/NCLs include:\n\n*Skin or tissue sampling. The doctor can examine a small piece of tissue under an [[electron microscope]]. The powerful magnification of the microscope helps the doctor spot typical NCL deposits. These deposits are found in many different tissues, including [[skin]], [[muscle]], [[conjunctiva]], [[rectal]] and others. Blood can also be used.{{citation needed|reason=A clinician is unlikely to make use of an electron microscope; the inclusions are often easily seen using light microscopy|date=November 2008}} These deposits take on characteristic shapes, depending on the variant under which they are said to occur: granular osmophilic deposits (GRODs) are generally characteristic of INCL, while [[curvilinear]] profiles, fingerprint profiles, and mixed-type inclusions are typically found in LINCL, JNCL, and ANCL, respectively.\n*[[Electroencephalogram]] or EEG. An EEG uses special patches placed on the scalp to record electrical currents inside the brain. This helps doctors see telltale patterns in the brain's electrical activity that suggest a patient has [[seizures]].\n*Electrical studies of the eyes. These tests, which include [[visual-evoked response]]s (VER) and [[Electroretinography|electroretinogram]]s (ERG), can detect various eye problems common in childhood Batten disease/NCLs.\n*Brain scans. Imaging can help doctors look for changes in the brain's appearance. The most commonly used imaging technique is [[computed tomography]] (CT), which uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. A second imaging technique that is increasingly common is [[magnetic resonance imaging]], or MRI. MRI uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain.\n*Enzyme assay. A recent development in diagnosis of Batten disease/NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] [[enzyme]]s for infantile and late infantile only. This is a quick and easy diagnostic test.\n\n=== Types===\n\nThe older classification of NCL divided the condition into four types (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and CLN4) based upon age of onset, while newer classifications divide it by the associated gene.<ref name=\"pmid15965709\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mole SE, Williams RE, Goebel HH |title=Correlations between genotype, ultrastructural morphology and clinical phenotype in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses |journal=Neurogenetics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=107\u201326 |date=September 2005 |pmid=15965709 |doi=10.1007/s10048-005-0218-3}}</ref><ref>{{OMIM|256730}}</ref>\n\nCLN4 (unlike CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) has not been mapped to a specific gene.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''Type''' || '''Description''' || '''[[OMIM]]''' || '''Gene'''\n |- \n | Type 1 || '''Infantile NCL''' ([[Santavuori\u2013Haltia disease]], INCL): begins between about 6 months and 2 years of age and progresses rapidly.

Both schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder, as defined by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV-TR), have the same symptoms and essential features except for two differences: the level of functional impairment and the duration of symptoms. Impairment in social, occupational, or academic [[Global assessment of functioning|functioning]] is usually present in schizophrenia, particularly near the time of first diagnosis, but such impairment may or may not be present in schizophreniform disorder. In schizophreniform disorder, the symptoms (including prodromal, active, and residual phases) must last at least 1 month but not more than 6 months, while in schizophrenia the symptoms must be present for a minimum of 6 months.<ref name=\"DSM\">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'', (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association.</ref>\n\n== Cause ==\n\nThe exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, and relatively few studies have focused exclusively on the etiology of schizophreniform disorder. Like other [[psychotic disorders]], a [[diathesis\u2013stress model]] has been proposed, suggesting that some individuals have an underlying [[multifactorial inheritance|multifactorial]] [[genetics|genetic]] vulnerability to the disorder that can be triggered by certain [[environmental factors]]. Schizophreniform disorder is more likely to occur in people with family members who have [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIf the symptoms have persisted for at least one month, a provisional diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made while waiting to see if recovery occurs. If the symptoms resolve within 6 months of onset, the provisional qualifier is removed from the diagnosis. However, if the symptoms persist for 6 months or more, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder must be revised. The diagnosis of [[brief psychotic disorder]] may be considered when the duration of symptoms is less than one month.\n\nThe main symptoms of both schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia may include:<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n*[[delusion]]s,\n*[[hallucination]]s,\n*disorganized speech resulting from [[formal thought disorder]],\n*disorganized or [[catatonia|catatonic behavior]], and [[negative symptoms]], such as\n*an inability to feel a range of emotions ([[flat affect]]),\n*an inability to experience pleasure ([[anhedonia]]),\n*impaired or decreased speech ([[aphasia]]),\n*a lack of desire to form relationships ([[asociality]]), and\n*a lack of motivation ([[avolition]]).\n\n==Treatment==\nVarious modalities of treatment, including [[psychopharmacology|pharmacotherapy]], [[psychotherapy]], and various other psychosocial and educational interventions, are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder. Pharmacotherapy is the most commonly used treatment modality as [[psychiatric medications]] can act quickly to both reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten their duration. The medications used are largely the same as those used to treat schizophrenia, with an [[atypical antipsychotic]] as the usual drug of choice. Patients who do not respond to the initial atypical antipsychotic may benefit from\nbeing switched to another atypical antipsychotic, the addition of a [[mood stabilizer]] such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] or an [[anticonvulsant]], or being switched to a [[typical antipsychotic]].<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nTreatment of schizophreniform disorder can occur in [[inpatient]], [[outpatient]], and [[partial hospitalization]] settings. In selecting the treatment setting, the primary aims are to minimize the psychosocial consequences for the patient and maintain the safety of the patient and others. While the need to quickly stabilize the patient's symptoms almost always exists, consideration of the patient's severity of symptoms, family support, and perceived likelihood of compliance with outpatient treatment can help determine if stabilization can occur in the outpatient setting. Patients who receive inpatient treatment may benefit from a structured intermediate environment, such as a sub-acute unit, step-down unit, partial hospital, or [[day hospital]], during the initial phases of returning to the community.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nAs improvement progresses during treatment, help with coping skills, problem-solving techniques, psychoeducational approaches, and eventually [[occupational therapy]] and  vocational assessments are often very helpful for patients and their families. Virtually all types of [[individual psychotherapy]] are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder, except for [[insight oriented therapy|insight-oriented therapies]] as patients often have limited insight as a symptom of their illness.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nSince schizophreniform disorder has such rapid onset of severe symptoms, patients are sometimes in [[denial]] about their illness, which also would limit the efficacy of insight-oriented therapies. Supportive forms of psychotherapy such as [[interpersonal psychotherapy]], [[supportive psychotherapy]], and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] are particularly well suited for the treatment of the disorder. [[Group psychotherapy]] is usually not indicated for patients with schizophreniform disorder because they may be distressed by the symptoms of patients with more advanced [[psychotic disorder]]s.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n== Prognosis ==\nThe following specifiers for schizophreniform disorder may be used to indicate the presence or absence of features that may be associated with a better [[prognosis]]:\n\n*With Good Prognostic Features, used if at least two of the following features are present:\n**Onset of prominent [[Psychosis#Signs and symptoms|psychotic symptoms]] within 4 weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning\n**Confusion or perplexity at the height of the [[psychotic episode]]\n**Good premorbid [[Global assessment of functioning|social and occupational functioning]]\n**Absence of [[flat affect|blunted]] or [[flat affect|flat]] [[affect (psychology)|affect]]\n*Without Good Prognostic Features, used if two or more of the above features have not been present.\n\nThe presence of negative symptoms and poor eye contact both appear to be prognostic of a poor outcome.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1991.tb05562.x |vauthors=Troisi A, Pasini A, Bersani G, Di Mauro M, Ciani N |title=Negative symptoms and visual behavior in DSM-III-R prognostic subtypes of schizophreniform disorder |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=391\u20134 |date=May 1991 |pmid=1853733 }}</ref> Many of the anatomic and functional changes seen in the [[brain]]s of patients with schizophrenia also occur in patients with schizophreniform disorder.

The diagnosis of [[brief psychotic disorder]] may be considered when the duration of symptoms is less than one month.\n\nThe main symptoms of both schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia may include:<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n*[[delusion]]s,\n*[[hallucination]]s,\n*disorganized speech resulting from [[formal thought disorder]],\n*disorganized or [[catatonia|catatonic behavior]], and [[negative symptoms]], such as\n*an inability to feel a range of emotions ([[flat affect]]),\n*an inability to experience pleasure ([[anhedonia]]),\n*impaired or decreased speech ([[aphasia]]),\n*a lack of desire to form relationships ([[asociality]]), and\n*a lack of motivation ([[avolition]]).\n\n==Treatment==\nVarious modalities of treatment, including [[psychopharmacology|pharmacotherapy]], [[psychotherapy]], and various other psychosocial and educational interventions, are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder. Pharmacotherapy is the most commonly used treatment modality as [[psychiatric medications]] can act quickly to both reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten their duration. The medications used are largely the same as those used to treat schizophrenia, with an [[atypical antipsychotic]] as the usual drug of choice. Patients who do not respond to the initial atypical antipsychotic may benefit from\nbeing switched to another atypical antipsychotic, the addition of a [[mood stabilizer]] such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] or an [[anticonvulsant]], or being switched to a [[typical antipsychotic]].<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nTreatment of schizophreniform disorder can occur in [[inpatient]], [[outpatient]], and [[partial hospitalization]] settings. In selecting the treatment setting, the primary aims are to minimize the psychosocial consequences for the patient and maintain the safety of the patient and others. While the need to quickly stabilize the patient's symptoms almost always exists, consideration of the patient's severity of symptoms, family support, and perceived likelihood of compliance with outpatient treatment can help determine if stabilization can occur in the outpatient setting. Patients who receive inpatient treatment may benefit from a structured intermediate environment, such as a sub-acute unit, step-down unit, partial hospital, or [[day hospital]], during the initial phases of returning to the community.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nAs improvement progresses during treatment, help with coping skills, problem-solving techniques, psychoeducational approaches, and eventually [[occupational therapy]] and  vocational assessments are often very helpful for patients and their families. Virtually all types of [[individual psychotherapy]] are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder, except for [[insight oriented therapy|insight-oriented therapies]] as patients often have limited insight as a symptom of their illness.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nSince schizophreniform disorder has such rapid onset of severe symptoms, patients are sometimes in [[denial]] about their illness, which also would limit the efficacy of insight-oriented therapies. Supportive forms of psychotherapy such as [[interpersonal psychotherapy]], [[supportive psychotherapy]], and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] are particularly well suited for the treatment of the disorder. [[Group psychotherapy]] is usually not indicated for patients with schizophreniform disorder because they may be distressed by the symptoms of patients with more advanced [[psychotic disorder]]s.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n== Prognosis ==\nThe following specifiers for schizophreniform disorder may be used to indicate the presence or absence of features that may be associated with a better [[prognosis]]:\n\n*With Good Prognostic Features, used if at least two of the following features are present:\n**Onset of prominent [[Psychosis#Signs and symptoms|psychotic symptoms]] within 4 weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning\n**Confusion or perplexity at the height of the [[psychotic episode]]\n**Good premorbid [[Global assessment of functioning|social and occupational functioning]]\n**Absence of [[flat affect|blunted]] or [[flat affect|flat]] [[affect (psychology)|affect]]\n*Without Good Prognostic Features, used if two or more of the above features have not been present.\n\nThe presence of negative symptoms and poor eye contact both appear to be prognostic of a poor outcome.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1991.tb05562.x |vauthors=Troisi A, Pasini A, Bersani G, Di Mauro M, Ciani N |title=Negative symptoms and visual behavior in DSM-III-R prognostic subtypes of schizophreniform disorder |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=391\u20134 |date=May 1991 |pmid=1853733 }}</ref> Many of the anatomic and functional changes seen in the [[brain]]s of patients with schizophrenia also occur in patients with schizophreniform disorder.

The most common ages of onset are 18\u201324 for men and 18\u201335 for women. While the symptoms of schizophrenia often develop gradually over a period of years, the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder require a much more rapid onset.<ref name=\"emedicine\"/>\n\nAvailable evidence suggests variations in [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] across sociocultural settings. In the [[United States]] and other [[developed countries]], the incidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. In [[developing countries]], the incidence is substantially higher, especially for the subtype \"With Good Prognostic Features\".

In 1897, Basel was chosen by [[Theodor Herzl]] as the location for the first [[World Zionist Congress]], and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. The name of the city is internationally well-known through institutions like the [[Basel Accords]], [[Art Basel]] and [[FC Basel]].\n\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] together with [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Geneva]].<ref>https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Basel}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in Augusta Raurica ]]\nThere are traces of a settlement at the [[Rhine knee]] from the early [[La T\u00e8ne period]] (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the [[Raurici]] at the site of ''Basel-Gasfabrik'', to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of ''Arialbinnum'' mentioned on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Teuteberg: ''Basler Geschichte,'' p. 49.</ref> The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an ''[[Basel oppidum|oppidum]]'' on the site of [[Basel Minster]], probably in reaction to the [[Gallic War|Roman invasion of Gaul]].\n\nIn [[Roman Gaul]], [[Augusta Raurica]] was established some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a ''[[castra]]'' (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic ''oppidum''. The city of Basel eventually grew around the ''castra''. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the ''[[Provincia Maxima Sequanorum]]'' formed by [[Diocletian]].\n\nThe Germanic confederation of the [[Alemanni]] attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the [[Battle of Solicinium]] (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].

The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the [[Renaissance]], and has emerged as a centre for the [[Chemical industry|chemical]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical industries]] in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by [[Theodor Herzl]] as the location for the first [[World Zionist Congress]], and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. The name of the city is internationally well-known through institutions like the [[Basel Accords]], [[Art Basel]] and [[FC Basel]].\n\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] together with [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Geneva]].<ref>https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Basel}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in Augusta Raurica ]]\nThere are traces of a settlement at the [[Rhine knee]] from the early [[La T\u00e8ne period]] (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the [[Raurici]] at the site of ''Basel-Gasfabrik'', to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of ''Arialbinnum'' mentioned on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Teuteberg: ''Basler Geschichte,'' p. 49.</ref> The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an ''[[Basel oppidum|oppidum]]'' on the site of [[Basel Minster]], probably in reaction to the [[Gallic War|Roman invasion of Gaul]].\n\nIn [[Roman Gaul]], [[Augusta Raurica]] was established some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a ''[[castra]]'' (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic ''oppidum''. The city of Basel eventually grew around the ''castra''. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the ''[[Provincia Maxima Sequanorum]]'' formed by [[Diocletian]].\n\nThe Germanic confederation of the [[Alemanni]] attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the [[Battle of Solicinium]] (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]]. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\n\nThe [[Duchy of Alemannia]] fell under [[Francia|Frankish]] rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the [[Bishopric of Basel]]. Based on the evidence of a third ''solidus''{{clarify|date=August 2018}}{{Fix|text=Does this mean a coin worth one third of a solidus?}} with the inscription ''Basilia fit'', Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmb.ch/en/collection/object/basel-kopie-vom-gold-triens-des-muenzmeisters-gunso-anfangs-7-jh-vs.html |title=Basel.

At the partition of the [[Carolingian Empire]], Basel was first given to [[West Francia]], but it passed to [[East Francia]] with the [[treaty of Meerssen]] of 870.\n\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a [[Magyar invasion]] in 917.

Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market.<ref name=\"habicht\"/> The [[Crusade of 1267]] set out from Basel.\n\n[[Black Death|The plague came to Europe]] in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349.

They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake of 1356]] which destroyed much of the city along with a [[R\u00f6tteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BASILEA.png|thumb|right|1493 woodcut of Basle, from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known [[Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen]] was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope Felix V]]. In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]], where such notables as [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught.

Basel is home to the largest orchestra in Switzerland, the [[Sinfonieorchester Basel]]. It is also the home of the [[Basel Sinfonietta]] and the [[Kammerorchester Basel]], which recorded the complete symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for the [[Sony]] label, led by its music director [[Giovanni Antonini]]. The Schola Cantorum and the Basler Kammerorchester were both founded by the conductor [[Paul Sacher]], who went on to commission works by many leading composers. The Paul Sacher Foundation, opened in 1986, houses a major collection of manuscripts, including the entire [[Igor Stravinsky]] archive.\nThe baroque orchestras La Cetra and Capriccio Basel are also based in Basel.\n\nIn May 2004, the fifth European Festival of Youth Choirs (Europ\u00e4isches Jugendchorfestival, or EJCF) opened; this Basel tradition started in 1992. Host of the festival is the local [[Basel Boys Choir]].\n\nIn 1997, Basel contended to become the \"[[European Capital of Culture]]\", though the honor went to [[Thessaloniki]].\n\n===Museums===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of museums]] -->\n[[File:Basel - 2017 - Kunstmuseum Basel - Altbau.jpg|thumb|The [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], oldest public museum of art in Europe]]\nThe [[Museums in Basel|Basel museums]] cover a broad and diverse spectrum of [[collection (museum)|collections]] with a marked concentration in the [[fine art]]s. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.<ref name=Museums>{{cite web |url=http://www.bs.ch/en/Portrait/Kultur/Museen.html |title=A lot to see in such a small city |publisher=Canton of Basel-Stadt |type=official site |website=Kanton Basel-Stadt |accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>\n\nConstituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of [[avant-garde]] [[museum architecture]].\n[[File:R0014764.jpg|thumb|The [[Fondation Beyeler]] by Renzo Piano, located in Riehen]]\n\n* [[Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig]] Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antikenmuseumbasel.ch |title=Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig :: Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig |publisher=Antikenmuseumbasel.ch |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706221409/http://www.antikenmuseumbasel.ch/ |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Augusta Raurica]] Roman open-air museum<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baselland.ch/docs/kultur/augustaraurica/e/menu/index.php |title=Augusta Raurica |publisher=Baselland.ch |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425224429/http://www.baselland.ch/docs/kultur/augustaraurica/e/menu/index.php |archivedate=25 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Basel Paper Mill]] ({{lang-de|Basler Papierm\u00fchle}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papiermuseum.ch/default-1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205141605/http://www.papiermuseum.ch/default-1.htm |archivedate=5 February 2007 |title=Start-e |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Beyeler Foundation]] (Foundation Beyeler) [http://www.beyeler.com/ Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)]\n* Botanical Garden Basel [https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/University-Society/Botanical-Garden.html One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world]\n* [[Caricature & Cartoon Museum Basel]] ({{lang-de|Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonmuseum.ch/ |title=Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel \u2013 home |language=de |publisher=Cartoonmuseum.ch |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Dollhouse Museum]] ({{lang-de|Puppenhausmuseum}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puppenhausmuseum.ch |title=Puppenhausmuseum Basel: Startpage |publisher=Puppenhausmuseum.ch |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\n* Foundation Fernet Branca ({{lang-fr|Fondation Fernet Branca}}) in [[Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin]] near Basel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationfernet-branca.org |title=Foundation Fernet Branca |publisher=fondationfernet-branca.org |date= |accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> Modern art collection.\n* [[Basel Historical Museum|Historical Museum Basel]] ({{lang-de|Historisches Museum Basel}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmb.ch |title=Historisches Museum Basel |publisher=Hmb.ch |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Kunsthalle Basel]] Modern and contemporary art museum<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kunsthallebasel.ch |title=Kunsthalle Basel \u00b7 Aktuelle Ausstellungen |publisher=Kunsthallebasel.ch |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425135424/http://www.kunsthallebasel.ch/ |archivedate=25 April 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Kunstmuseum Basel]] [[Upper Rhine|Upper Rhenish]] and [[Flemish painting]]s, [[drawing]]s from 1400 to 1600 and 19th- to 21st-century art<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110011257/http://www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/ |archivedate=10 January 2008 |title=Kunstmuseum Basel &#124;

One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the [[Art Basel]] which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. [[Baselworld]], the watch and jewellery show (''Uhren- und Schmuckmesse'') one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer [[MCH Group]] has its head office in Basel.\n\n[[File:Top Secret Drum Corps.jpg|thumb|[[Top Secret Drum Corps]] at the 2009 Basel Tattoo]]\nThe [[carnival]] of the city of Basel (''[[Carnival of Basel|Basler Fasnacht]]'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (''Morgestraich'') on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after [[Ash Wednesday]] and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\n\n[[Basel Tattoo]], founded in 2006 by the local [[Top Secret Drum Corps]], has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Edinburgh Military Tattoo]].<ref name=\"swissinfo\">[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Basels_tattoo_spins_to_success.html?cid=995834 Basel's tattoo spins to success]. swissinfo.ch, written 2008-7-15, retrieved 2012-7-13</ref> The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport|Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS)]], making it the official [[military tattoo]] of Switzerland.\n\n===Cuisine===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including ''[[Basler L\u00e4ckerli]]'' cookies and ''[[M\u00e4ssmogge]]'' candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n===Zoo===\n[[File:ZolliAntelopeHouse2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Antelope]] House at [[Zoo Basel]]]]\n''[[Zoo Basel]]'' is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year,<ref name=\"2011 visitors\">[http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Trotz-Grossbaustelle-Besucherrekord-beim-Zolli/story/10759447 {{in lang|de}} Besucherrekord beim Zolli].

GetListy, retrieved 26 March 2010</ref>\n\nDespite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"''Zolli''\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n===Sport===\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The [[association football|football]] club [[FC Basel]] continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championships]], as well as [[Geneva]], [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Bern]]. The championships were jointly hosted by [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. [[BSC Old Boys]] and [[Concordia Basel]] are the other football teams in Basel.\n\n[[File:R federer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roger Federer]] at the 2010 Australian Open]]\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is [[ice hockey]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/|title= Popular sports in Switzerland | publisher=popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info | accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> Basel is home to the [[EHC Basel]] which plays in the [[1.

The team previously played in the [[National League (ice hockey)|National League]] and the [[Swiss League]], but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the [[2013-14 National League B season|2013-14 Swiss League season]].\n\nBasel features a large [[St. Jakob-Park|football stadium]] that has been awarded four stars by [[UEFA]], a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]-professionals play every year at the [[Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Swiss Indoors]], including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant [[Roger Federer]], a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\n\nThe annual [[Basel Rhine Swim]] draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming in the Rhine in Basel|url=http://www.lifeinbasel.com/2014/06/09/swimming-in-the-rhine-in-basel/|publisher=Life in Basel|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called [[Swiss Basketball League|SBL]], is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unibaselbasket.ch/english.html|title=English|website=Uni Basel Basket -

It serves the [[Framingham/Worcester Line]]. It is located next to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] in the [[Fenway-Kenmore]] neighborhood near [[Kenmore Square]], below grade between [[Beacon Street]] and [[Brookline Avenue]]. \n\nThe station, originally named after former [[Boston Red Sox]] owner [[Tom Yawkey]], opened as an [[infill station]] in 1988, for limited service to baseball games at [[Fenway Park]]. Regular commuter service began in 2001 for riders headed to [[Boston University]], Kenmore Square, and the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]]. Inbound and outbound trains formerly shared a single two-car platform on the inbound track, requiring passengers to embark or debark from the front two cars of outbound trains or the rear two cars of inbound trains. \n\nIn 2012, work began on a new, fully [[accessibility|accessible]] station, including two longer high-level platforms and an overhead pedestrian bridge which will eventually allow direct access from the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue overpasses through the planned Fenway Center development. Passengers boarded from the east end of the new station from June 2013 until March 10, 2014; after delays, it opened fully that day. The new station is served by all Worcester Line trains, which was expected to increase ridership from 585 total daily boardings and alightings to 937. By a 2018 count, there were 2,491 daily (1,195 boardings and 1,296 alightings).<ref name=CRcounts />\n\nThe station was renamed Lansdowne (after nearby Lansdowne Street) effective April 8, 2019, following the May 2018 renaming of [[Yawkey Way]] back to Jersey Street.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yawkey platform 2.JPG|thumb|left|The 1990s-built \"mini-high\" platform at Yawkey in 2011 (removed in 2013)]]\n\n===Game day service===\nOriginally named in honor of long-time [[Boston Red Sox]] owner [[Tom Yawkey]], the station was opened on April 29, 1988, and initially was only used for special service to Fenway Park for baseball games.<ref name=netransit /> It was used by Framingham Line trains as well as special weekend-only \"Fenway Flyer\" baseball trains from the Attleboro (now [[Providence/Stoughton Line|Providence/Stoughton]]), [[Fairmount Line|Fairmount]], and [[Franklin Line|Franklin]] lines. Service from the Attleboro and Fairmount lines began on July 12, 1988, followed by the Franklin Line on July 27.<ref name=chronicle>{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/cron/project/uncertainty/Dowd_Data/Baum_Snow/boston-history.txt |title=A Chronicle of the Boston Transit System |year=1992 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |via=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |last=Sanborn |first=George M.}}</ref> The \"Fenway Flyer\" trains had an annual ridership of 58,000 in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11544541.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611022415/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11544541.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |title=How MBTA rebuilt ridership |page=33 |author=Middleton, William D. |date=November 1, 1991 |publisher=Railway Age |volume=192 |issue=11 |url-access=subscription  |via=Highbeam Research}}</ref> The station became popular enough that the MBTA added regular commuter service.

An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service (on all modes) to Fenway Park on game days. Possibilities studied included running game day service from the [[Plymouth/Kingston Line]] with an unused trainset, a South Station-Yawkey shuttle, increased Green Line service, and bus shuttles to the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] in Cambridge and to [[Ruggles (MBTA station)|Ruggles station]].

The pedestrian bridge was lifted into place in August 2013, followed by the various roof and canopy elements. The second track was rebuilt in late September, followed by the remaining platform segments.\n\nThe new station fully opened on March 10, 2014, coinciding with planned service increases on the Framingham/Worcester Line.

It serves the [[Framingham/Worcester Line]]. It is located next to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] in the [[Fenway-Kenmore]] neighborhood near [[Kenmore Square]], below grade between [[Beacon Street]] and [[Brookline Avenue]]. \n\nThe station, originally named after former [[Boston Red Sox]] owner [[Tom Yawkey]], opened as an [[infill station]] in 1988, for limited service to baseball games at [[Fenway Park]]. Regular commuter service began in 2001 for riders headed to [[Boston University]], Kenmore Square, and the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]]. Inbound and outbound trains formerly shared a single two-car platform on the inbound track, requiring passengers to embark or debark from the front two cars of outbound trains or the rear two cars of inbound trains. \n\nIn 2012, work began on a new, fully [[accessibility|accessible]] station, including two longer high-level platforms and an overhead pedestrian bridge which will eventually allow direct access from the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue overpasses through the planned Fenway Center development. Passengers boarded from the east end of the new station from June 2013 until March 10, 2014; after delays, it opened fully that day. The new station is served by all Worcester Line trains, which was expected to increase ridership from 585 total daily boardings and alightings to 937. By a 2018 count, there were 2,491 daily (1,195 boardings and 1,296 alightings).<ref name=CRcounts />\n\nThe station was renamed Lansdowne (after nearby Lansdowne Street) effective April 8, 2019, following the May 2018 renaming of [[Yawkey Way]] back to Jersey Street.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yawkey platform 2.JPG|thumb|left|The 1990s-built \"mini-high\" platform at Yawkey in 2011 (removed in 2013)]]\n\n===Game day service===\nOriginally named in honor of long-time [[Boston Red Sox]] owner [[Tom Yawkey]], the station was opened on April 29, 1988, and initially was only used for special service to Fenway Park for baseball games.<ref name=netransit /> It was used by Framingham Line trains as well as special weekend-only \"Fenway Flyer\" baseball trains from the Attleboro (now [[Providence/Stoughton Line|Providence/Stoughton]]), [[Fairmount Line|Fairmount]], and [[Franklin Line|Franklin]] lines.

Although this type of leukoplakia may show [[dysplasia]], the potential for malignant transformation is unknown.<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Ultraviolet radiation===\nUltraviolet radiation is believed to be a factor in the development of some leukoplakia lesions of the lower lip, usually in association with [[actinic cheilitis]].<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Micro-organisms===\n[[Candida (genus)|Candida]] in its [[pathogenic]] [[hyphae|hyphal]] form is occasionally seen in biopsies of idiopathic leukoplakia.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> --> It is debated whether candida infection is a primary cause of leukoplakia with or without dysplasia, or a superimposed (secondary) infection that occurs after the development of the lesion.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> --> It is known that Candida species thrive in altered tissues.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Some leukoplakias with dysplasia reduce or disappear entirely following use of [[antifungal medication]].<ref name=Nev2002 /> Smoking, which as discussed above can lead to the development of leukoplakia, can also promote oral candidiasis.<ref name=Nev2002 /> Candida in association with leukoplakia should not be confused with white patches which are primarily caused by candida infection, such as chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (\"candidal leukoplakia\").<ref name=\"Coulthard 2008\" />\n\nThe involvement of viruses in the formation of some oral white lesions is well established, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus in oral hairy leukoplakia (which is not a true leukoplakia). [[Human papilloma virus]] (HPV), especially HPV 16 and 18,<ref name=Nev2002 /> is sometimes found in areas of leukoplakia, however since this virus can be coincidentally found on normal, healthy mucosal surfaces in the mouth, it is unknown if this virus is involved in the development of some leukoplakias.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> ''[[In vitro]] ''experimentation has demonstrated that HPV 16 is capable of inducing dysplastic changes in previously normal [[squamous epithelium]].<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Epithelial atrophy===\nLeukoplakia is more likely to develop in areas of epithelial [[atrophy]]. Conditions associated with mucosal atrophy include iron deficiency, some vitamin deficiencies, [[oral submucous fibrosis]], syphilis and [[sideropenic dysphagia]].<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n===Trauma===\nAnother very common cause of white patches in the mouth is frictional or irritational trauma leading to keratosis. Examples include [[nicotine stomatitis]], which is keratosis in response to heat from tobacco smoking (rather than a response to the [[carcinogen]]s in tobacco smoke).<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> The risk of malignant transformation is similar to normal mucosa.<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> Mechanical trauma, e.g. caused by a sharp edge on a denture, or a broken tooth, may cause white patches which appear very similar to leukoplakia.<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> However, these white patches represent a normal hyperkeratotic reaction, similar to a [[callus]] on the skin, and will resolve when the cause is removed.<ref name=Nev2002 /> Where there is a demonstrable cause such as mechanical or thermal trauma, the term idiopathic leukoplakia should not be used.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n===Tumor suppressor genes===\n\n[[Tumor suppressor gene]]s are genes involved in the regulation of normal cell turnover and [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> One of the most studied tumor suppressor genes is [[p53]], which is found on the short arm of chromosome 17. [[Mutation]] of p53 can disrupt its regulatory function and lead to uncontrolled cell growth.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Mutations of p53 have been demonstrated in the cells from areas of some leukoplakias, especially those with dysplasia and in individuals who smoke and drink heavily.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Definition===\nLeukoplakia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that which lesions are included depends upon what diagnoses are currently considered acceptable.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Accepted definitions of leukoplakia have changed over time and are still controversial.<ref name=\"Tanaka 2011\" /> It is possible that the definition will be further revised as new knowledge becomes available.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\nIn 1984 an international symposium agreed upon the following definition: \"a whitish patch or plaque, which cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease, and is not associated with any physical or chemical agent except the use of tobacco.\"<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> There were, however, problems and confusion in applying this definition.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> At a second international symposium held in 1994, it was argued that, whilst tobacco was a likely causative factor in the development of leukoplakia, some white patches could be linked directly to the local effects of tobacco by virtue of their disappearance following smoking cessation, suggesting that this kind of white patch represents a reactive lesion to local tissue irritation rather than a lesion caused by carcinogens in cigarette smoke, and could be better termed to reflect this etiology, e.g. smokers' keratosis.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> The second international symposium therefore revised the definition of leukoplakia to: \"a predominantly white lesion of the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion.\"\n\nIn the mouth, the current definition of oral leukoplakia adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] is \"white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer\".<ref name=\"Warna 2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnakulasuriya S, Johnson NW, van der Waal I | title = Nomenclature and classification of potentially malignant disorders of the oral mucosa | journal = Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 575\u201380 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17944749 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2007.00582.x }}</ref> However, this definition is inconsistently applied in the medical literature, and some refer to any oral white patch as \"leukoplakia\".<ref name=Od2010 />\n\nThe term has been incorrectly used for white patches of any cause (rather than specifically referring to idiopathic white patches) and also to refer only to white patches which have a risk of cancerous changes.<ref name=Od2010 /> It has been suggested that ''leukoplakia'' is an unhelpful term since there is so much inconsistency surrounding its use,<ref name=Od2010 /> and some clinicians now avoid using it at all.<ref name=\"Tanaka 2011\" />\n\n===Biopsy===\n[[File:Cheekcells stained.jpg|thumbnail|left|Microscopic examination of [[keratinocyte]]s scraped from the buccal mucosa]]\nTissue [[biopsy]] is usually indicated<ref name=Sc2000/> to rule out other causes of white patches and also to enable a detailed [[histology|histologic]] examination to grade the presence of any epithelial dysplasia. This is an indicator of malignant potential and usually determines the management and recall interval. The sites of a leukoplakia lesion that are preferentially biopsied are the areas that show [[induration]] (hardening) and [[erythroplasia]] (redness), and erosive or [[mouth ulcer|ulcerated]] areas. These areas are more likely to show any dysplasia than homogenous white areas.<ref name=Sc2000/>\n\n[[Exfoliative cytology#Cell collection|Brush biopsy/exfoliative cytology]] is an alternative to incisional biopsy,<ref name=Sc2000 /> where a stiff brush is scraped against the lining of the mouth to remove a sample of cells. This is then made into a smear which can be examined microscopically. Sometimes the biopsy site can be selected with adjunct methods which aim to highlight areas of dysplasia. [[Toluidine blue]] staining, where the dye is preferentially retained by dysplastic tissue, is sometimes used, but there is high [[false positive]] rate.<ref name=Od2010 /> Other methods involve the use of illuminescence, relying on either the property of normal autoflorescent molecules in mucosa such as [[collagen]] and keratin which is lost from areas of dysplasia or carcinoma under blue light, or by initially staining of the mucosa with toluidine blue or dilute acetic acid and examination under white light.<ref name=Od2010 />\n\n===Histologic appearance===\nLeukoplakia has a wide range of possible histologic appearances. The degree of hyperkeratosis, epithelial thickness ([[acanthosis]]/[[wikt:atrophy|atrophy]]), dysplasia and inflammatory cell [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]] in the underlying lamina propria are variable.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> In mucous membranes, hyperkeratosis can be defined as \"an increase in the thickness of the keratin layer of the epithelium, or the presence of such a layer in a site where none would normally be expected.\"<ref name=\"Tyldesley 2003\" /> In leukoplakia, the hyperkeratosis varies in thickness, and may be either ortho- or para-keratosis, (depending upon whether [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] are lost or retained in the superficial layers respectively), or a mixture of both in different areas of the lesion.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /><ref name=\"Cawson 2002\" />\n\nThe epithelium may show hypertrophy (e.g. acanthosis) or atrophy. Red areas within leukoplakia represent atrophic or immature epithelium which has lost the ability to keratinize.<ref name=Nev2002 /> The transition between the lesion and normal surrounding mucosa may be well demarcated, or poorly defined.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />  --> Melanin, a pigment naturally produced in oral mucosa, can leak from cells and give a grey color to some leukoplakia lesions.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\nHyperkeratosis and altered epithelial thickness may be the only histologic features of a leukoplakia lesion, but some show dysplasia. The word \"dysplasia\" generally means \"abnormal growth\", and specifically in the context of oral red or white lesions refers to microscopic changes (\"cellular [[atypia]]\") in the mucosa that indicate a risk of malignant transformation.<ref name=Od2010 /> When dysplasia is present, there is generally an inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria.<ref name=\"Cawson 2002\" /> The following are commonly cited as being possible features of [[epithelial dysplasia]] in leukoplakia specimens:<ref name=Od2010 /><ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n* Cellular [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]], in which cells are of abnormal and different shapes.\n* [[Nuclear atypia]], in which the [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] of cells varies in size, any may be [[NC ratio|increased in size relative to the cytoplasm]], shape, and may [[Hyperchromasia|stain more intensely]]. There may also be more prominent [[nucleolus|nucleoli]].\n* Increased number of cells seen undergoing [[mitosis]], including both normal and abnormal mitoses. Abnormal mitosis may be abnormally located, e.g. occurring in suprabasal cells (cell layers more superficial to the basal cell layer) or of abnormal form, e.g. \"tri-radiate mitoses\" (a cell splitting into 3 daughter cells rather than only 2)\n* Loss the normal organization of the epithelial layers. The distinction between the epithelial layers may be lost. Normally [[stratified squamous epithelium]] shows progressive changes in the form of cells from the basal to the superficial layers, with cells becoming more flat (\"squames\") towards the surface as a continuous maturation process. In dysplastic epithelium, cells may become vertically orientated rather than becoming flat towards the surface. \n* There may be abnormal [[keratinization]], where keratin is formed below the normal keratin layer. This can occur in individual cells or groups of cells, forming an intraepithelial [[keratin pearl]].  There may be an increase in number of basal cells, and they may lose their cellular orientation (losing their polarity and long axis).\n* Alteration of the normal epithelial-connective tissue architecture - the [[rete peg]]s may become \"drop shaped\". wider at their base than more superficially.\n\nGenerally dysplasia is subjectively graded by pathologists into mild, moderate or severe dysplasia. This requires experience as it is a difficult skill to learn. It has been shown that there is high degree of inter-observer variation and poor reproducibility in how dysplasia is graded.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\">{{cite book|last=Kerawala C, Newlands C (editors)|title=Oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920483-0|pages=422\u2013424}}</ref> Severe dysplasia is synonymous with the term [[carcinoma in situ]], denoting the presence of neoplastic cells which have not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] and invaded other tissues.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:350px;\"\n|-\n!

There are also few recognized subtypes of leukoplakia, described according to the clinical appearance of the lesion.\n\nAlmost all oral white patches are usually the result of keratosis.<ref name=Od2010 /> For this reason oral white patches are sometimes generally described as keratoses, although a minority of oral white lesions are not related to hyperkeratosis, e.g. epithelial [[necrosis]] and ulceration caused by a chemical burn (see: [[Oral ulceration#Chemical injury]]).<ref name=Od2010 /> In keratosis, the thickened keratin layer absorbs water from saliva in the mouth and appears white in comparison with normal mucosa. Normal oral mucosa is a red-pink color due the underlying vasculature in the [[lamina propria]] showing through the thin layer of epithelium. Melanin produced in the oral mucosa also influences the color, with a darker appearance being created by higher levels of melanin in the tissues (associated with racial/physiologic pigmentation, or with disorders causing melanin overproduction such as [[Addison's disease]]).<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Other endogenous pigments can be overproduced to influence the color, e.g. [[bilirubin]] in [[hyperbilirubinemia]] or [[hemosiderin]] in [[hemochromatosis]], or exogenous pigments such as heavy metals can be introduced into the mucosa, e.g. in an [[amalgam tattoo]].\n\nAlmost all white patches are benign, i.e. non-malignant. The [[differential diagnosis]] of a white lesion in the mouth can be considered according to a [[surgical sieve]] (see table).<ref name=Od2010 /><ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /><ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\">{{cite book|vauthors=Ter\u00e9zhalmy GT, Huber MA, Jones AC, Sankar V, Noujeim M |title=Physical evaluation in dental practice|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=978-0-8138-2131-3|pages=170, 171|edition=Ed. 1st.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cawson 2002\">{{cite book|vauthors=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S |title=Cawson\u015b essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine.|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-443-07106-5|pages=221\u2013238|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nLeukoplakia cannot be rubbed off the mucosa,<ref name=Pet2005/> distinguishing it readily from white patches such as pseudomembraneous candidiasis, where a white layer can be removed to reveal an erythematous, sometimes bleeding surface underneath. The white color associated with leukoedema disappears when the mucosa is stretched. A frictional keratosis will generally be adjacent to a sharp surface such as a broken tooth or rough area on a denture and will disappear when the causative factor is removed. Some have a suggested as general rule that any lesion that does not show signs of healing within 2 weeks should be biopsied.<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> Morsicatio buccarum and [[Linea alba (cheek)|linea alba]] are located at the level of the occlusal plane (the level at which the teeth meet). A chemical burn has a clear history of placing an aspirin tablet (or other caustic substance such as [[eugenol]]) against the mucosa in an attempt to relieve toothache. Developmental white patches usually are present from birth or become apparent earlier in life, whilst leukoplakia generally affects middle aged or elderly people. Other causes of white patches generally require pathologic examination of a biopsy specimen to distinguish with certainty from leukoplakia.\n\n==Management==\nA systematic review found that no treatments commonly used for leukoplakia have been shown to be effective in preventing malignant transformation. Some treatments may lead to healing of leukoplakia, but do not prevent relapse of the lesion or malignant change.<ref name=Lodi2016/> Regardless of the treatment used, a diagnosis of leukoplakia almost always leads to a recommendation that possible causative factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption be stopped,<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> and also involves long term review of the lesion,<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> to detect any malignant change early and thereby improve the prognosis significantly.\n\n===Predisposing factors and review===\nBeyond advising smoking cessation, many clinicians will employ [[watchful waiting]] rather than intervene. Recommended recall intervals vary. One suggested program is every 3 months initially, and if there is no change in the lesion, then annual recall thereafter.<!-- <ref name=Od2010 /> --> Some clinicians use clinical photographs of the lesion to help demonstrate any changes between visits.<!-- <ref name=Od2010 /> --> Watchful waiting does not rule out the possibility of repeated biopsies.<ref name=Od2010 /> If the lesion changes in appearance repeat biopsies are especially indicated.<ref name=Gli2003 /> Since smoking and alcohol consumption also places individuals at higher risk of tumors occurring in the respiratory tract and pharynx, \"red flag\" symptoms (e.g. [[hemoptysis]] - coughing blood) often trigger medical investigation by other specialties.<ref name=Od2010 />\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical removal of the lesion is the first choice of treatment for many clinicians.<!-- <ref name=Lodi2016 /> --> However, the efficacy of this treatment modality cannot be assessed due to insufficient available evidence.<ref name=Lodi2016 /> This can be carried out by traditional surgical excision with a scalpel, with lasers, or with [[Electrocautery#Electrocautery|eletrocautery]] or [[cryotherapy]].<!-- <ref name=Lodi2016 /> --><ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> Often if biopsy demonstrates moderate or severe dysplasia then the decision to excise them is taken more readily. Sometimes white patches are too large to remove completely and instead they are monitored closely. Even if the lesion is completely removed, long term review is still usually indicated since leukoplakia can recur, especially if predisposing factors such as smoking are not stopped.<ref name=Gli2003 />\n\n===Medications===\nMany different [[Route of administration#Topical|topical]] and [[Route of administration#Local or systemic effect|systemic]] medications have been studied, including [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]], [[antimycotic]]s (target Candida species), [[carotenoid]]s (precursors to [[vitamin A]], e.g. [[beta carotene]]), [[retinoid]]s (drugs similar to vitamin A), and [[cytotoxic]]s, but none have evidence that they prevent malignant transformation in an area of leukoplakia.<ref name=Lodi2016 />[[vitamin C|Vitamins C]] and [[vitamin E|E]] have also been studied with regards a therapy for leukoplakia.<ref name=Gli2003 /> Some of this research is carried out based upon the hypothesis that [[antioxidant]] nutrients, [[vitamin]]s and cell growth suppressor proteins (e.g. p53) are antagonistic to [[oncogenesis]].<ref name=Gli2003 /> High doses of retinoids may cause toxic effects.<ref name=Lodi2016 /> Other treatments that have been studied include [[photodynamic therapy]].<ref name=Lodi2016 />\n\n==Prognosis==\n[[File:NIH DOC 17 Leukoplakia.jpg|thumbnail|right|White patch on left buccal mucosa.

Although this type of leukoplakia may show [[dysplasia]], the potential for malignant transformation is unknown.<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Ultraviolet radiation===\nUltraviolet radiation is believed to be a factor in the development of some leukoplakia lesions of the lower lip, usually in association with [[actinic cheilitis]].<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Micro-organisms===\n[[Candida (genus)|Candida]] in its [[pathogenic]] [[hyphae|hyphal]] form is occasionally seen in biopsies of idiopathic leukoplakia.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> --> It is debated whether candida infection is a primary cause of leukoplakia with or without dysplasia, or a superimposed (secondary) infection that occurs after the development of the lesion.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> --> It is known that Candida species thrive in altered tissues.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Some leukoplakias with dysplasia reduce or disappear entirely following use of [[antifungal medication]].<ref name=Nev2002 /> Smoking, which as discussed above can lead to the development of leukoplakia, can also promote oral candidiasis.<ref name=Nev2002 /> Candida in association with leukoplakia should not be confused with white patches which are primarily caused by candida infection, such as chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (\"candidal leukoplakia\").<ref name=\"Coulthard 2008\" />\n\nThe involvement of viruses in the formation of some oral white lesions is well established, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus in oral hairy leukoplakia (which is not a true leukoplakia). [[Human papilloma virus]] (HPV), especially HPV 16 and 18,<ref name=Nev2002 /> is sometimes found in areas of leukoplakia, however since this virus can be coincidentally found on normal, healthy mucosal surfaces in the mouth, it is unknown if this virus is involved in the development of some leukoplakias.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> ''[[In vitro]] ''experimentation has demonstrated that HPV 16 is capable of inducing dysplastic changes in previously normal [[squamous epithelium]].<ref name=Nev2002 />\n\n===Epithelial atrophy===\nLeukoplakia is more likely to develop in areas of epithelial [[atrophy]]. Conditions associated with mucosal atrophy include iron deficiency, some vitamin deficiencies, [[oral submucous fibrosis]], syphilis and [[sideropenic dysphagia]].<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n===Trauma===\nAnother very common cause of white patches in the mouth is frictional or irritational trauma leading to keratosis. Examples include [[nicotine stomatitis]], which is keratosis in response to heat from tobacco smoking (rather than a response to the [[carcinogen]]s in tobacco smoke).<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> The risk of malignant transformation is similar to normal mucosa.<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> Mechanical trauma, e.g. caused by a sharp edge on a denture, or a broken tooth, may cause white patches which appear very similar to leukoplakia.<!-- <ref name=Nev2002 /> --> However, these white patches represent a normal hyperkeratotic reaction, similar to a [[callus]] on the skin, and will resolve when the cause is removed.<ref name=Nev2002 /> Where there is a demonstrable cause such as mechanical or thermal trauma, the term idiopathic leukoplakia should not be used.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n===Tumor suppressor genes===\n\n[[Tumor suppressor gene]]s are genes involved in the regulation of normal cell turnover and [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> One of the most studied tumor suppressor genes is [[p53]], which is found on the short arm of chromosome 17. [[Mutation]] of p53 can disrupt its regulatory function and lead to uncontrolled cell growth.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Mutations of p53 have been demonstrated in the cells from areas of some leukoplakias, especially those with dysplasia and in individuals who smoke and drink heavily.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Definition===\nLeukoplakia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that which lesions are included depends upon what diagnoses are currently considered acceptable.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Accepted definitions of leukoplakia have changed over time and are still controversial.<ref name=\"Tanaka 2011\" /> It is possible that the definition will be further revised as new knowledge becomes available.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\nIn 1984 an international symposium agreed upon the following definition: \"a whitish patch or plaque, which cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease, and is not associated with any physical or chemical agent except the use of tobacco.\"<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> There were, however, problems and confusion in applying this definition.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> At a second international symposium held in 1994, it was argued that, whilst tobacco was a likely causative factor in the development of leukoplakia, some white patches could be linked directly to the local effects of tobacco by virtue of their disappearance following smoking cessation, suggesting that this kind of white patch represents a reactive lesion to local tissue irritation rather than a lesion caused by carcinogens in cigarette smoke, and could be better termed to reflect this etiology, e.g. smokers' keratosis.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> The second international symposium therefore revised the definition of leukoplakia to: \"a predominantly white lesion of the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion.\"\n\nIn the mouth, the current definition of oral leukoplakia adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] is \"white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer\".<ref name=\"Warna 2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnakulasuriya S, Johnson NW, van der Waal I | title = Nomenclature and classification of potentially malignant disorders of the oral mucosa | journal = Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 575\u201380 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17944749 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2007.00582.x }}</ref> However, this definition is inconsistently applied in the medical literature, and some refer to any oral white patch as \"leukoplakia\".<ref name=Od2010 />\n\nThe term has been incorrectly used for white patches of any cause (rather than specifically referring to idiopathic white patches) and also to refer only to white patches which have a risk of cancerous changes.<ref name=Od2010 /> It has been suggested that ''leukoplakia'' is an unhelpful term since there is so much inconsistency surrounding its use,<ref name=Od2010 /> and some clinicians now avoid using it at all.<ref name=\"Tanaka 2011\" />\n\n===Biopsy===\n[[File:Cheekcells stained.jpg|thumbnail|left|Microscopic examination of [[keratinocyte]]s scraped from the buccal mucosa]]\nTissue [[biopsy]] is usually indicated<ref name=Sc2000/> to rule out other causes of white patches and also to enable a detailed [[histology|histologic]] examination to grade the presence of any epithelial dysplasia. This is an indicator of malignant potential and usually determines the management and recall interval. The sites of a leukoplakia lesion that are preferentially biopsied are the areas that show [[induration]] (hardening) and [[erythroplasia]] (redness), and erosive or [[mouth ulcer|ulcerated]] areas. These areas are more likely to show any dysplasia than homogenous white areas.<ref name=Sc2000/>\n\n[[Exfoliative cytology#Cell collection|Brush biopsy/exfoliative cytology]] is an alternative to incisional biopsy,<ref name=Sc2000 /> where a stiff brush is scraped against the lining of the mouth to remove a sample of cells. This is then made into a smear which can be examined microscopically. Sometimes the biopsy site can be selected with adjunct methods which aim to highlight areas of dysplasia. [[Toluidine blue]] staining, where the dye is preferentially retained by dysplastic tissue, is sometimes used, but there is high [[false positive]] rate.<ref name=Od2010 /> Other methods involve the use of illuminescence, relying on either the property of normal autoflorescent molecules in mucosa such as [[collagen]] and keratin which is lost from areas of dysplasia or carcinoma under blue light, or by initially staining of the mucosa with toluidine blue or dilute acetic acid and examination under white light.<ref name=Od2010 />\n\n===Histologic appearance===\nLeukoplakia has a wide range of possible histologic appearances. The degree of hyperkeratosis, epithelial thickness ([[acanthosis]]/[[wikt:atrophy|atrophy]]), dysplasia and inflammatory cell [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]] in the underlying lamina propria are variable.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> In mucous membranes, hyperkeratosis can be defined as \"an increase in the thickness of the keratin layer of the epithelium, or the presence of such a layer in a site where none would normally be expected.\"<ref name=\"Tyldesley 2003\" /> In leukoplakia, the hyperkeratosis varies in thickness, and may be either ortho- or para-keratosis, (depending upon whether [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] are lost or retained in the superficial layers respectively), or a mixture of both in different areas of the lesion.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /><ref name=\"Cawson 2002\" />\n\nThe epithelium may show hypertrophy (e.g. acanthosis) or atrophy. Red areas within leukoplakia represent atrophic or immature epithelium which has lost the ability to keratinize.<ref name=Nev2002 /> The transition between the lesion and normal surrounding mucosa may be well demarcated, or poorly defined.<!-- <ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />  --> Melanin, a pigment naturally produced in oral mucosa, can leak from cells and give a grey color to some leukoplakia lesions.<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\nHyperkeratosis and altered epithelial thickness may be the only histologic features of a leukoplakia lesion, but some show dysplasia. The word \"dysplasia\" generally means \"abnormal growth\", and specifically in the context of oral red or white lesions refers to microscopic changes (\"cellular [[atypia]]\") in the mucosa that indicate a risk of malignant transformation.<ref name=Od2010 /> When dysplasia is present, there is generally an inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria.<ref name=\"Cawson 2002\" /> The following are commonly cited as being possible features of [[epithelial dysplasia]] in leukoplakia specimens:<ref name=Od2010 /><ref name=\"Soames 1999\" />\n\n* Cellular [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]], in which cells are of abnormal and different shapes.\n* [[Nuclear atypia]], in which the [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] of cells varies in size, any may be [[NC ratio|increased in size relative to the cytoplasm]], shape, and may [[Hyperchromasia|stain more intensely]]. There may also be more prominent [[nucleolus|nucleoli]].\n* Increased number of cells seen undergoing [[mitosis]], including both normal and abnormal mitoses. Abnormal mitosis may be abnormally located, e.g. occurring in suprabasal cells (cell layers more superficial to the basal cell layer) or of abnormal form, e.g. \"tri-radiate mitoses\" (a cell splitting into 3 daughter cells rather than only 2)\n* Loss the normal organization of the epithelial layers. The distinction between the epithelial layers may be lost. Normally [[stratified squamous epithelium]] shows progressive changes in the form of cells from the basal to the superficial layers, with cells becoming more flat (\"squames\") towards the surface as a continuous maturation process. In dysplastic epithelium, cells may become vertically orientated rather than becoming flat towards the surface. \n* There may be abnormal [[keratinization]], where keratin is formed below the normal keratin layer. This can occur in individual cells or groups of cells, forming an intraepithelial [[keratin pearl]].  There may be an increase in number of basal cells, and they may lose their cellular orientation (losing their polarity and long axis).\n* Alteration of the normal epithelial-connective tissue architecture - the [[rete peg]]s may become \"drop shaped\". wider at their base than more superficially.\n\nGenerally dysplasia is subjectively graded by pathologists into mild, moderate or severe dysplasia. This requires experience as it is a difficult skill to learn. It has been shown that there is high degree of inter-observer variation and poor reproducibility in how dysplasia is graded.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\">{{cite book|last=Kerawala C, Newlands C (editors)|title=Oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920483-0|pages=422\u2013424}}</ref> Severe dysplasia is synonymous with the term [[carcinoma in situ]], denoting the presence of neoplastic cells which have not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] and invaded other tissues.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:350px;\"\n|-\n!

There are also few recognized subtypes of leukoplakia, described according to the clinical appearance of the lesion.\n\nAlmost all oral white patches are usually the result of keratosis.<ref name=Od2010 /> For this reason oral white patches are sometimes generally described as keratoses, although a minority of oral white lesions are not related to hyperkeratosis, e.g. epithelial [[necrosis]] and ulceration caused by a chemical burn (see: [[Oral ulceration#Chemical injury]]).<ref name=Od2010 /> In keratosis, the thickened keratin layer absorbs water from saliva in the mouth and appears white in comparison with normal mucosa. Normal oral mucosa is a red-pink color due the underlying vasculature in the [[lamina propria]] showing through the thin layer of epithelium. Melanin produced in the oral mucosa also influences the color, with a darker appearance being created by higher levels of melanin in the tissues (associated with racial/physiologic pigmentation, or with disorders causing melanin overproduction such as [[Addison's disease]]).<ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /> Other endogenous pigments can be overproduced to influence the color, e.g. [[bilirubin]] in [[hyperbilirubinemia]] or [[hemosiderin]] in [[hemochromatosis]], or exogenous pigments such as heavy metals can be introduced into the mucosa, e.g. in an [[amalgam tattoo]].\n\nAlmost all white patches are benign, i.e. non-malignant. The [[differential diagnosis]] of a white lesion in the mouth can be considered according to a [[surgical sieve]] (see table).<ref name=Od2010 /><ref name=\"Soames 1999\" /><ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\">{{cite book|vauthors=Ter\u00e9zhalmy GT, Huber MA, Jones AC, Sankar V, Noujeim M |title=Physical evaluation in dental practice|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=978-0-8138-2131-3|pages=170, 171|edition=Ed. 1st.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cawson 2002\">{{cite book|vauthors=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S |title=Cawson\u015b essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine.|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-443-07106-5|pages=221\u2013238|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nLeukoplakia cannot be rubbed off the mucosa,<ref name=Pet2005/> distinguishing it readily from white patches such as pseudomembraneous candidiasis, where a white layer can be removed to reveal an erythematous, sometimes bleeding surface underneath. The white color associated with leukoedema disappears when the mucosa is stretched. A frictional keratosis will generally be adjacent to a sharp surface such as a broken tooth or rough area on a denture and will disappear when the causative factor is removed. Some have a suggested as general rule that any lesion that does not show signs of healing within 2 weeks should be biopsied.<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> Morsicatio buccarum and [[Linea alba (cheek)|linea alba]] are located at the level of the occlusal plane (the level at which the teeth meet). A chemical burn has a clear history of placing an aspirin tablet (or other caustic substance such as [[eugenol]]) against the mucosa in an attempt to relieve toothache. Developmental white patches usually are present from birth or become apparent earlier in life, whilst leukoplakia generally affects middle aged or elderly people. Other causes of white patches generally require pathologic examination of a biopsy specimen to distinguish with certainty from leukoplakia.\n\n==Management==\nA systematic review found that no treatments commonly used for leukoplakia have been shown to be effective in preventing malignant transformation. Some treatments may lead to healing of leukoplakia, but do not prevent relapse of the lesion or malignant change.<ref name=Lodi2016/> Regardless of the treatment used, a diagnosis of leukoplakia almost always leads to a recommendation that possible causative factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption be stopped,<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> and also involves long term review of the lesion,<ref name=\"Ter\u00e9zhalmy 2009\" /> to detect any malignant change early and thereby improve the prognosis significantly.\n\n===Predisposing factors and review===\nBeyond advising smoking cessation, many clinicians will employ [[watchful waiting]] rather than intervene. Recommended recall intervals vary.

It originally aired on [[NBC]] on March 14, 2013. The episode guest stars [[Majandra Delfino]], [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]], [[Thomas Middleditch]], Blake Garrett Rosenthal, [[David Koechner]], [[Allan Havey]], [[Nora Kirkpatrick]], Mary Gillis, and [[Michael Schur]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. The episode revolves around [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) attending the funeral of his Aunt Shirley at Schrute Farms, where his family reunites. Meanwhile, [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) returns to the office claiming to be a reformed man.\n\n\"The Farm\" was produced to serve as a [[television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor pilot]] for a proposed spin-off series starring Wilson as Dwight, which NBC ultimately did not pick up. The episode received mostly negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing Dwight's farm storyline and some critics calling it a \"Frankenstein episode\". The episode was viewed by 3.54 million viewers and received a 1.9/5 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) informs the office that his Aunt Shirley has died. The only co-worker he invites to the funeral is [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose ([[Michael Schur]]) and Zeke ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), his brother Jeb ([[Thomas Middleditch]]), his sister Fannie ([[Majandra Delfino]]) and his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate on the condition that they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in due to the lack of sophistication farm life offers, but agree to stay for a couple of days. Dwight bonds with Cammy and later surveys the farm with his siblings.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) visits the office and announces that he wants to make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. [[Pam Beesly|Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but the remaining employees eat their cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs. The next morning, Pam returns to the office and announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed. Packer visits [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Majandra Delfino at ATX 2014.jpg|alt=Delfino holding a microphone while seated|thumb|[[Majandra Delfino]] guest starred as Dwight's sister.]]\nThe episode was written and directed by executive producer and former showrunner [[Paul Lieberstein]], marking his thirteenth writing credit, sixth directorial credit and fourth dual credit.<ref>{{Cite episode | title = The Farm | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | credits =  Paul Lieberstein (writer & director) | network = NBC | airdate = March 14, 2013 | season = 9 | number = 17}}</ref> \"The Farm\" was the fifth episode produced, but was the seventeenth aired, as noted by its production number.<ref name=Sneakpeak>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Rainn|title=Remember all of these? #FinalSeason|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100191630757268|publisher=[[Facebook]].com|accessdate=December 13, 2012|date=December 13, 2012}}</ref> It was originally supposed to act as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a spin-off series, also called ''The Farm'' starring Wilson and focusing on Dwight.

It originally aired on [[NBC]] on March 14, 2013. The episode guest stars [[Majandra Delfino]], [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]], [[Thomas Middleditch]], Blake Garrett Rosenthal, [[David Koechner]], [[Allan Havey]], [[Nora Kirkpatrick]], Mary Gillis, and [[Michael Schur]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. The episode revolves around [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) attending the funeral of his Aunt Shirley at Schrute Farms, where his family reunites. Meanwhile, [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) returns to the office claiming to be a reformed man.\n\n\"The Farm\" was produced to serve as a [[television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor pilot]] for a proposed spin-off series starring Wilson as Dwight, which NBC ultimately did not pick up. The episode received mostly negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing Dwight's farm storyline and some critics calling it a \"Frankenstein episode\". The episode was viewed by 3.54 million viewers and received a 1.9/5 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) informs the office that his Aunt Shirley has died. The only co-worker he invites to the funeral is [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose ([[Michael Schur]]) and Zeik ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), his brother Jeb ([[Thomas Middleditch]]), his sister Fannie ([[Majandra Delfino]]) and his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate on the condition that they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in due to the lack of sophistication farm life offers, but agree to stay for a couple of days. Dwight bonds with Cammy and later surveys the farm with his siblings.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) visits the office and announces that he wants to make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. [[Pam Beesly|Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but the remaining employees eat their cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs. The next morning, Pam returns to the office and announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed. Packer visits [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Majandra Delfino at ATX 2014.jpg|alt=Delfino holding a microphone while seated|thumb|[[Majandra Delfino]] guest starred as Dwight's sister.]]\nThe episode was written and directed by executive producer and former showrunner [[Paul Lieberstein]], marking his thirteenth writing credit, sixth directorial credit and fourth dual credit.<ref>{{Cite episode | title = The Farm | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | credits =  Paul Lieberstein (writer & director) | network = NBC | airdate = March 14, 2013 | season = 9 | number = 17}}</ref> \"The Farm\" was the fifth episode produced, but was the seventeenth aired, as noted by its production number.<ref name=Sneakpeak>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Rainn|title=Remember all of these? #FinalSeason|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100191630757268|publisher=[[Facebook]].com|accessdate=December 13, 2012|date=December 13, 2012}}</ref> It was originally supposed to act as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a spin-off series, also called ''The Farm'' starring Wilson and focusing on Dwight.

Ritter's disease of the newborn is the most severe form of SSSS, with similar signs and symptoms. SSSS often includes a widespread painful erythroderma, often involving the face, diaper, and other [[intertriginous]] areas. Extensive areas of desquamation might be present. Perioral crusting and fissuring are seen early in the course. Unlike [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], SSSS spares the mucous membranes. It is most common in children under 6 years, but can be seen in adults who are immunosuppressed or have [[kidney failure]].\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe [[syndrome]] is induced by epidermolytic [[exotoxin]]s ([[exfoliatin]])<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000037652|exfoliatin}}</ref> A and B, which are released by ''S. aureus'' and cause detachment within the epidermal layer, by breaking down the [[desmosome]]s.  One of the exotoxins is encoded on the bacterial chromosome, while the other is encoded on a [[plasmid]]. These exotoxins are proteases that cleave [[desmoglein-1]], which normally holds the [[Stratum granulosum|granulosum]] and [[Stratum spinosum|spinosum]] layers together, similar to the pathophysiology of the autoimmune skin disease, [[pemphigus vulgaris]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nSSSS is a clinical diagnosis. This is sometimes confirmed by isolation of ''S. aureus'' from blood, mucous membranes, or skin biopsy; however, these are often negative. Skin biopsy may show separation of the superficial layer of the epidermis (intraepidermal separation), differentiating SSSS from TEN, wherein the separation occurs at the dermo-epidermal junction (subepidermal separation). SSSS may be difficult to distinguish from toxic epidermal necrolysis and pustular psoriasis.\n\n==Treatment==\nThe mainstay of treatment for SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., [[ibuprofen]] or [[paracetamol]]), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover ''S. aureus'' should be administered. Most strains of ''S. aureus'' implicated in SSSS have [[penicillinase]]s, so are penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with [[nafcillin]], [[oxacillin]], or [[vancomycin]] is typically indicated. [[Clindamycin]] is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins.\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of SSSS in children is excellent, with complete resolution within 10 days of treatment, and without significant scarring. However, SSSS must be differentiated carefully from toxic epidermal necrolysis, which carries a poor prognosis. The prognosis in adults is generally much worse, and depends upon various factors such as time to treatment, host immunity, and comorbidities.\n\n==History==\n\nThe clinical features were first described in 1878 by Baron Gottfried Ritter von Rittershain, who observed 297 cases among children in a single Czechoslovakian children's home over a 10-year period.<ref name=\"pmid15816826\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mockenhaupt M, Idzko M, Grosber M, Sch\u00f6pf E, Norgauer J | title = Epidemiology of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in Germany | journal = J.

Ritter's disease of the newborn is the most severe form of SSSS, with similar signs and symptoms. SSSS often includes a widespread painful erythroderma, often involving the face, diaper, and other [[intertriginous]] areas. Extensive areas of desquamation might be present. Perioral crusting and fissuring are seen early in the course. Unlike [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], SSSS spares the mucous membranes. It is most common in children under 6 years, but can be seen in adults who are immunosuppressed or have [[kidney failure]].\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe [[syndrome]] is induced by epidermolytic [[exotoxin]]s ([[exfoliatin]])<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000037652|exfoliatin}}</ref> A and B, which are released by ''S. aureus'' and cause detachment within the epidermal layer, by breaking down the [[desmosome]]s.  One of the exotoxins is encoded on the bacterial chromosome, while the other is encoded on a [[plasmid]]. These exotoxins are proteases that cleave [[desmoglein-1]], which normally holds the [[Stratum granulosum|granulosum]] and [[Stratum spinosum|spinosum]] layers together, similar to the pathophysiology of the autoimmune skin disease, [[pemphigus vulgaris]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nSSSS is a clinical diagnosis. This is sometimes confirmed by isolation of ''S. aureus'' from blood, mucous membranes, or skin biopsy; however, these are often negative. Skin biopsy may show separation of the superficial layer of the epidermis (intraepidermal separation), differentiating SSSS from TEN, wherein the separation occurs at the dermo-epidermal junction (subepidermal separation). SSSS may be difficult to distinguish from toxic epidermal necrolysis and pustular psoriasis.\n\n==Treatment==\nThe mainstay of treatment for SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., [[ibuprofen]] or [[paracetamol]]), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover ''S. aureus'' should be administered. Most strains of ''S. aureus'' implicated in SSSS have [[penicillinase]]s, so are penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with [[nafcillin]], [[oxacillin]], or [[vancomycin]] is typically indicated. [[Clindamycin]] is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins.\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of SSSS in children is excellent, with complete resolution within 10 days of treatment, and without significant scarring. However, SSSS must be differentiated carefully from toxic epidermal necrolysis, which carries a poor prognosis. The prognosis in adults is generally much worse, and depends upon various factors such as time to treatment, host immunity, and comorbidities.\n\n==History==\n\nThe clinical features were first described in 1878 by Baron Gottfried Ritter von Rittershain, who observed 297 cases among children in a single Czechoslovakian children's home over a 10-year period.<ref name=\"pmid15816826\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mockenhaupt M, Idzko M, Grosber M, Sch\u00f6pf E, Norgauer J | title = Epidemiology of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in Germany | journal = J.
