The Pawnee tribal economic activities throughout the year alternated between farming crops and hunting [[American bison|buffalo]].\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Pawnee numbered more than 60,000&nbsp;people and were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the west. Although dominating the [[Loup River|Loup (ickari\u02be)]] and [[Platte River|Platte (k\u00edckatuus)]] river areas for centuries, they later suffered from increasing encroachment and attrition by their numerically superior, nomadic enemies: the [[Sioux]] (or [[Lakota people|Lakota (p\u00e1hriksukat / paah\u00edksukat)]] (\"cut throat / cuts the throat\"), [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne (s\u00e1he / s\u00e1hi)]], and [[Arapaho|Arapaho (s\u00e1ri\u02beitihka)]] (\"dog eater\"); the Pawnee called these collectively as c\u00e1rarat (\"enemy tribe\") or cahriksuupi\u00edru\u02be (\"[[enemy]]\"). The Pawnee were occasionally at war with the [[Comanche|Comanche (raar\u00edhta\u02be)]] and [[Kiowa|Kiowa (k\u00e1\u02beiwa)]] farther south. They had suffered many losses due to Eurasian infectious diseases brought by the expanding Europeans, and by 1860, the Pawnee population was reduced to 4,000. It further decreased, because of disease, crop failure, and warfare, to approximately 2,400 by 1873, after which time the Pawnee were forced to move to Indian Territory in [[Oklahoma]]. Many Pawnee warriors enlisted to serve as Indian scouts in the [[US Army]] to track and fight their tribal enemies resisting [[European-American]] expansion on the [[Great Plains]].\n\n==Government==\nThere are approximately 3,200&nbsp;enrolled Pawnee and nearly all reside in Oklahoma. Their tribal headquarters is in [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]], and their [[tribal jurisdictional area]] is in parts of [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble]], [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne]], and [[Pawnee County, Oklahoma|Pawnee counties]]. The tribal constitution establishes the government of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. This government consists of the Resaru Council, the Pawnee Business Council, and the Supreme Court.

[[Archeology]] studies of ancient sites have demonstrated the people lived in this pattern for nearly 700&nbsp;years, since about 1250&nbsp;CE.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\nThe Pawnee generally settled close to the rivers and placed their lodges on the higher banks. They built [[earth lodge]]s that by historical times tended to be oval in shape; at earlier stages, they were rectangular. They constructed the frame, made of 10\u201315&nbsp;posts set some {{convert|10|feet}} apart, which outlined the central room of the lodge. Lodge size varied based on the number of poles placed in the center of the structure. Most lodges had 4, 8, or 12&nbsp;center-poles. A common feature in Pawnee lodges were four painted poles, which represented the four [[cardinal directions]] and the four major star gods (not to be confused with [[Creator deity|the Creator]]). A second outer ring of poles outlined the outer circumference of the lodge. Horizontal beams linked the posts together.\n[[File:Pawnee lodge.jpg|thumb|Pawnee lodges near [[Genoa, Nebraska]] (1873)]]\n\nThe frame was covered first with smaller poles, tied with willow withes. The structure was covered with thatch, then earth. A hole left in the center of the covering served as a combined chimney / smoke vent and skylight. The door of each lodge was placed to the east and the rising sun. A long, low passageway, which helped keep out outside weather, led to an entry room that had an interior buffalo-skin door on a hinge. It could be closed at night and wedged shut. Opposite the door, on the west side of the central room, a [[bison|buffalo]] skull with horns was displayed. This was considered [[Shamanism among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|great medicine]].\n\nMats were hung on the perimeter of the main room to shield small rooms in the outer ring, which served as sleeping and private spaces. The lodge was semi-subterranean, as the Pawnee recessed the base by digging it approximately {{convert|3|feet|4=0|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=on}} below ground level, thereby insulating the interior from extreme temperatures. Lodges were strong enough to support adults, who routinely sat on them, and the children who played on the top of the structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Prairie Logbooks |last=Carleton |first=James Henry |authorlink=James Henry Carleton |year=1983 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6314-7}}</ref> (See photo above.)\n\nAs many as 30\u201350&nbsp;people might live in each lodge, and they were usually of related families. A village could consist of as many as 300\u2013500&nbsp;people and 10\u201315&nbsp;households. Each lodge was divided in two (the north and south), and each section had a head who oversaw the daily business. Each section was further subdivided into three duplicate areas, with tasks and responsibilities related to the ages of women and girls, as described below. The membership of the lodge was quite flexible.\n\nThe tribe went on buffalo hunts in summer and winter. Upon their return, the inhabitants of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations of support for the wife (and family they married into), but could always go back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When young couples married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Pawnee are a [[matrilineal]] people. Ancestral descent is traced through the mother, and children are considered born into the mother's clan and are part of her people. Traditionally, a young couple moved into the bride's parents' lodge. People work together in collaborative ways, marked by both independence and cooperation, without coercion. Both women and men are active in political life, with independent decision-making responsibilities.\n\nWithin the lodge, each north-south section had areas marked by activities of the three classes of women:\n*Mature women (usually married and mothers), who did most of the labor;\n*Young single women, just learning their responsibilities; and\n*Older women, who looked after the young children.\n\nAmong the collection of lodges, the political designations for men were essentially between:\n*the Warrior Clique; and\n*the Hunting Clique.\n\nWomen tended to be responsible for decisions about resource allocation, trade, and inter-lodge social negotiations. Men were responsible for decisions which pertained to hunting, war, and spiritual/health issues.\n\nWomen tended to remain within a single lodge, while men would typically move between lodges. They took multiple sexual partners in serially monogamous relationships.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe Pawnee women were skilled horticulturalists and cooks, cultivating and processing ten varieties of [[maize|corn]], seven of [[pumpkin]]s and [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], and eight of [[beans]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}\n<blockquote>They planted their crops along the fertile river bottomlands. These crops provided a wide variety of nutrients and complemented each other in making whole proteins. In addition to varieties of [[flint corn]] and [[flour corn]] for consumption, the women planted an archaic breed which they called \"Wonderful\" or \"Holy Corn\", specifically to be included in the sacred bundles.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote>\n\nThe holy corn was cultivated and harvested to replace corn in the sacred bundles prepared for the major seasons of winter and summer. Seeds were taken from sacred bundles for the spring planting ritual. The cycle of corn determined the annual agricultural cycle, as it was the first to be planted and first to be harvested (with accompanying ceremonies involving priests and men of the tribe as well.)<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn keeping with their [[cosmology]], the Pawnee classified the varieties of corn by color: black, spotted, white, yellow, and red (which, excluding spotted, related to the colors associated with the four semi-cardinal directions). The women kept the different strains separate as they cultivated the corn. While important in agriculture, squash and beans were not given the same theological meaning as corn.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn 2005, the last 25&nbsp;remaining seeds of the Pawnee Eagle Corn variety were successfully sprouted. The unique taste of Eagle Corn is described as being similar to almonds with cream. In November&nbsp;2010, a traditional Pawnee ceremony with Eagle Corn soup was held in Oklahoma. According to ''[[True West Magazine]]'', Eagle Corn soup had not been available for ceremonies for 125&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://truewestmagazine.com/keepers-of-the-seed/ |title=Keepers of the Seed |last=Bommersbach |first=Jana |date=2012-04-25 |magazine=True West Magazine |access-date=2018-03-07 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting===\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Pawnee Indians Migrating - Walters 37194066.jpg|thumb|Pawnee Indians migrating, by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\nAfter they obtained horses, the Pawnee adapted their culture and expanded their [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunting seasons. With horses providing a greater range, the people traveled in both summer and winter westward to the [[Great Plains]] for buffalo hunting. They often traveled {{convert|500|miles}} or more in a season. In summer the march began at dawn or before, but usually did not last the entire day.\n\nOnce buffalo were located, hunting did not begin until the tribal priests considered the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, but no one could kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.<ref>{{cite dictionary |first=W.P. |last=Clark |article=Hunt |title=The Indian Sign Language |location=Lincoln, NE |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1982 |orig-year=1885 |edition=trade paperback |isbn=0-8032-6309-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful kills, the women processed the bison meat, skin and bones for various uses: the flesh was sliced into strips and dried on poles over slow fires before being stored. Prepared in this way, it was usable for several months. Although the Pawnee preferred buffalo, they also hunted other game, including elk, bear, panther, and skunk, for meat and skins. The skins were used for clothing and accessories, storage bags, foot coverings, fastening ropes and ties, etc.\n\nThe people returned to their villages to harvest crops when the corn was ripe in late summer, or in the spring when the grass became green and they could plant a new cycle of crops. Summer hunts extended from late June to about the first of September; but might end early if hunting was successful. Sometimes the hunt was limited to what is now western Nebraska. Winter hunts were from late October until early April and were often to the southwest into what is now western Kansas.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Caeser Bruce silver comb 1984 ohs.jpg|thumb|Ornamental [[hair comb]] by Bruce Caesar (Pawnee-[[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]), 1984, of [[German silver]], [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\nLike many other Native American tribes, the Pawnee had a cosmology with elements of all of nature represented in it. They based many rituals in the four cardinal directions. Pawnee priests conducted ceremonies based on the [[sacred]] bundles that included various materials, such as an ear of sacred corn, with great symbolic value. These were used in many religious ceremonies to maintain the balance of nature and the Pawnee relationship with the gods and spirits. In the 1890s, already in Oklahoma, the people participated in the [[Ghost Dance]] movement.\n\nThe Pawnee believed that the Morning Star and Evening Star gave birth to the first Pawnee woman. The first Pawnee man was the offspring of the union of the Moon and the Sun. As they believed they were descendants of the stars, cosmology had a central role in daily and spiritual life. They planted their crops according to the position of the stars, which related to the appropriate time of season for planting. Like many tribal bands, they sacrificed [[maize]] and other crops to the stars.\n\n====Morning Star ritual====\nThe Skidi Pawnees in Village Across a Hill<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murie, James R. |year=1981 |series=Ceremonies of the Pawnee |title=Part&nbsp;I: The Skiri |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology |issue=27 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{rp|32}} practiced [[human sacrifice]], specifically of captive girls, in the \"[[Morning Star ritual]]\". They continued this practice regularly through the 1810s and possibly after 1838 \u2013 the last reported sacrifice. They believed the longstanding rite ensured the fertility of the soil and success of the crops, as well as renewal of all life in spring and triumphs on the battlefields.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|13}} The sacrifice was related to the belief that the first human being was a girl, born of the mating of the [[Venus|Morning Star]], the male figure of light, and the unwilling [[Venus|Evening Star]], a female figure of darkness, in their [[Creation myth|creation story]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|39}}\n\nThe ritual stood outside the organization of the ceremonial year and was not necessarily an annual occurrence. The commencement of the ceremony required that a man had been commanded to sponsor it while asleep.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Typically, a warrior would dream of the Morning Star, usually in the autumn, which meant it was time to prepare for the various steps of the ritual. The visionary would consult with the Morning Star priest, who helped him prepare for his journey to find a sacrifice. During the initial meeting both would cry and cry, because they knew the missions forced upon them by divine demand were wrong to carry out.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|115}} With help from others, the warrior would capture a young unmarried girl from an enemy tribe. The Pawnee kept the girl and cared for her over the winter, taking her with them as they made their buffalo hunt. They arranged her sacrifice in the spring, in relation to the rising of the Morning Star. She was well treated and fed throughout this period.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}\n\n[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year ...\" (1907-1943) (19176154258).jpg|thumb|Miniature model of the Morning Star ritual, [[Field Museum]]]]\nWhen the morning star (either the planet [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], or some times [[Venus]])<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|38}}<ref name=Thurman1970>{{cite journal |author=Thurman, Melburn D. |title=The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star sacrifice of 1827 |journal=Nebraska History |year=1970 |pages=268\u2013280}}</ref>{{rp|footnote&nbsp;#4, p.&nbsp;277}} rose ringed with red, the priest knew it was the signal for the sacrifice. He directed the men to carry out the rest of the ritual, including the construction of a [[scaffold]] outside the village. It was made of sacred woods and leathers from different animals, each of which had important symbolism. It was erected over a pit with elements corresponding to the four cardinal directions. All the elements of the ritual related to symbolic meaning and belief, and were necessary for the renewal of life. The preparations took four days.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nMost of the actual ceremony took place in the earth lodge of the visionary, since the Pawnee villages did not have a special ceremonial lodge.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Bystanders outside dug holes in the wall and tore the roof apart to follow the elaborate ceremony.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|120}} A procession of all the men and boys \u2013 even male infants carried among the men \u2013 accompanied the girl out of the village to the scaffold. Together they awaited the morning star. When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow from a sacred bow,<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|107}} then the priest cut the skin of her chest to increase bleeding. She was shot quickly with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried to the east and placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nAbout 1820\u20131821, news of these sacrifices reached the East Coast; it caused a sensation among European Americans. Before this, US [[Indian agent]]s had counseled Pawnee chiefs to suppress the practice, as they warned of how it would upset the American settlers, who were arriving in ever greater number. Superintendent [[William Clark]] in [[St. Louis]] had pointed out the government's view on the ceremony to a visiting Pawnee delegation already in 1811.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal |author=Jones, Dorothy V. |year=1969 |title=John Dougherty and the Pawnee rite of human sacrifice: April&nbsp;1827 |journal=Missouri Historical Review |volume=63 |pages=293\u2013316}}</ref>{{rp|294}} Slowly, a Skidi faction that opposed the old rite developed.

Another group, the Guas, may have been known later as the Paniouace.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|33}} These people put up ferocious resistance when Coronado started to plunder their villages.<ref name=Winship1990/>\n\nIn 1601, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] led another ''entrada'' in search of the wealth of Quivira. He met \"Escansaques\", probably Apaches, who tried to persuade him to plunder and destroy \"Quiviran\" villages.\n\n===Arrival of horses and metal weapons===\nAbout 1670 the Apaches of the Southern Plains obtained horses and metal weapons in sufficient quantity to make them the dread of all their neighbors. For some decades the Pawnees were the victims of intensive raiding by large bands of mounted Apaches with iron weapons, and also by war parties of [[Chickasaw]]s and [[Choctaw]]s from the east who had firearms as well. The [[Dhegihan languages|Siouan]] groups that became [[Quapaw]]s, [[Osage Nation|Osage]]s, [[Omaha people|Omaha]]s, [[Ponca]]s and [[Kaw people|Kansa]]s also appeared on the Plains about this time, driven west by the expansion of the [[Iroquois]], and they too raided the Pawnees.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|54\u201356}} Archaeology indicates that pressure from hostile Apaches may have persuaded the Skidi Pawnees to move from their settlements on the [[Republican River]] to the upper [[Loup River]] in the course of the next century or so.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|43, 50, 51}} Their settlement pattern also changed from little villages of small rectangular earth-lodges to more defensible larger, compact villages of larger, circular lodges, the Skidis uniting in this way about 1680 while their close relations the Arikaras established a separate identity.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|51\u201355}}\n\n===Pawnees enslaved===\n{{main|Panis (slaves of First Nation descent)}}\nThe main form of loot was women and children, to be sold as slaves. In 1694, Apaches brought a large number of captive children to the trading fair in [[New Mexico]], but for some reason there were not enough buyers, so the Apaches beheaded all their slaves in full view of the Spaniards.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|46}} In [[French Canada]], [[Slavery in Canada|Indian slaves]] were generally called ''Panis'' (anglicized to Pawnee), as most, during this period, had been captured from the Pawnee tribe or their relations. Pawnee became synonymous with \"Indian slave\" in general use in Canada, and a slave from any tribe came to be called ''Panis.'' As early as 1670, a reference was recorded to a ''Panis'' in Montreal.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QBaTtGgyWakC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=Pawnee+slaves+in+Canada#v=onepage&q=Pawnee%20slaves%20in%20Canada&f=false |first=Carter Godwin |last=Woodson |date=July 1920 |title=The Slave in Canada |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013264 |access-date=17 November 2009}}</ref> By 1757 [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] considered that the Panis nation \"plays ... the same role in America that the Negroes do in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\">{{cite book |title=Canada's Forgotten Slaves |first1=Marcel |last1=Trudel |first2=Micheline |last2=d'Allaire |orig-year=1963 |translator=George Tombs |year=2013 |publisher=V\u00e9hicule Press |page=64}}</ref> The historian [[Marcel Trudel]] documented that close to 2,000&nbsp;\"panis\" [[slavery|slaves]] lived in [[Canada]] until the abolition of slavery in the colony in 1833.<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\" /> Indian slaves comprised close to half of the known slaves in [[French Canada]] (also called Lower Canada).\n\n===Pawnees acquire metal and horses===\n\nBy 1719 when [[Jean-Baptiste B\u00e9nard de la Harpe|de la Harpe]] led an expedition to Caddoan lands at the mouth of the [[Arkansas River]], the Pawnees had also acquired horses and metal weapons from French traders, and they were attacking Apaches in turn, destroying their villages and carrying off Apache women and children.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|57}} In 1720, [[Pierre Dugu\u00e9 de Boisbriand|Boisbriant]] reported that the Paniassas or Black Pawnees had recently captured a hundred Apaches, whom they were burning, a few each day.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|76}} de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Harpe planned to establish French trading posts at the mouth of the [[Canadian River]] and elsewhere in Caddoan territory, but this was not done and the Pawnee remained dependent on infrequent and casual traders, while their enemies \u2013 the Osages \u2013 benefited from a regular trade.\n\nIn 1720, the [[Villasur expedition]] was sent to the Pawnees in an attempt to wean the tribe away from their French connections (which had been greatly magnified in Spanish imagination). Guided mainly by Apaches, and led by an officer without experience of Indians, the expedition approached the Skidi Pawnee villages along the outflow of the [[Loup River]] into the [[Platte River]] in modern Nebraska. The expedition sent their only Pawnee slave to make contact; he did not obtain any welcome for the Spanish party and he shortly failed to return to the Spanish camp. The Pawnees attacked at dawn, shooting heavy musketry fire and flights of arrows, then charging into combat clad only in paint, headband, moccasins and short leggings.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|75\u201376}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Segesser Hide paintings: History, discovery, art |first=Thomas E. |last=Chavez |journal=Great Plains Quarterly |department=Center for Great Plains Studies |publisher=University of Nebraska |location=Lincoln, NE |date=1 January 1990 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1412&context=greatplainsquarterly}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmhistorymuseum.org/hides/ |website=NMHistorymuseum.org |series=The Segesser Hides Explorer |title=Virtual tour of the hides}}</ref> Villasur, forty-five other Spaniards and eleven Pueblos were killed, and the survivors fled.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|66\u201369}} In 1721, pressure on the Pawnees was increased by the establishment of a colony in [[Arkansas]] by [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s [[Mississippi Company]]; this settlement too formed a market for Indian (mostly Caddoan) slaves and a convenient source of weapons for the Osages and their relations.\n\nThe French responded by sending [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont|Bourgmont]] to make peace (in the French interest) between the Pawnees and their enemies in 1724. He reported that the Pawnee were a strong tribe and good horsemen, but, located at the far end of every trade route for European goods, were unfamiliar with Europeans and were treated like country bumpkins by their southern relatives. The mutual hatred between Pawnees and Apaches was so great that both sides were cooking and eating many of their captives.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|47}} Bourgmont's \"peace\" had little effect.\n\nIn 1739 the [[Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet|Mallet brothers]] visited the Skidi Pawnee. In 1750 the Skidis were reported to be ruled by a grand chief who had 900 warriors.\n\nFrom about 1760, [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out on the Great Plains, reducing the Skidi from eight large villages in 1725 to one by 1800.\n\n===Increasing contact with English-speakers, ongoing tribal warfare===\n[[File:Seymour Pawnees 1819.jpg|thumb|Pawnees in a parley with Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Long]]'s expedition at [[Engineer Cantonment]], near Council Bluffs, Iowa, in October 1819]]\nA Pawnee tribal delegation visited [[Thomas Jefferson|President Thomas Jefferson]]. In 1806 Lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]], [[Major G. C. Sibley]], [[Major S. H. Long]], among others, began visiting the Pawnee villages. Under pressure from Siouan tribes and European-American settlers, the Pawnee ceded territory to the United States government in treaties in 1818, 1825, 1833, 1848, 1857, and 1892. In 1857, they settled on the [[Pawnee Reservation]] along the Loup River in present-day [[Nance County, Nebraska]], but maintained their traditional way of life. They were subjected to continual raids by [[Lakota people|Lakota]] from the north and west.\n\n[[File:Sharitarish - Wicked Chief - by Charles Bird King, c1822.jpg|thumb|left|1822 portrait of [[Sharitahrish]] by [[Charles Bird King]], on display in the [[Library (White House)|Library]] of the [[White House]]]] Until the 1830s, the Pawnee in what became United States territory were relatively isolated from interaction with Europeans.

Like other groups of Native American scouts, Pawnee warriors were recruited in large numbers to fight on the Northern and Southern Plains in various conflicts against hostile Native Americans. Because the Pawnee people were old enemies of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche and Kiowa tribes, they served with the army for fourteen years between 1864 and 1877, earning a reputation as being a well-trained unit, especially in tracking and reconnaissance. The Pawnee Scouts took part with distinction in the [[Battle of the Tongue River]] during the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)]] against Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho and in the [[Battle of Summit Springs]]. They also fought with the US in the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]]. On the Southern Plains they fought against their old enemies, the Comanches and Kiowa, in the [[Comanche Campaign]].\n\n===Relocation and reservation===\n [[File:Cloud-Shield's winter count (Lakota). 1873-74.

On one such raid, 5&nbsp;August 1873, a Sioux war party of over 1,000 warriors ambushed a Pawnee hunting party of 350&nbsp;men, women, and children. The Pawnee had gained permission to leave the reservation and hunt buffalo. About 70&nbsp;Pawnee were killed in this attack, which occurred in a canyon in present-day [[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]. The site is known as [[Massacre Canyon]]. Because of the ongoing hostilities with the Sioux and encroachment from American settlers to the south and east, the Pawnee decided to leave their Nebraska reservation in the 1870s and settle on a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]], located in what is today Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1874, the Pawnee requested relocation to [[Indian Territory]] (Oklahoma), but the stress of the move, diseases and poor conditions on their reservation reduced their numbers even more. During this time, outlaws often smuggled whiskey to the Pawnee. The teenaged female bandits [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]] and [[Cattle Annie]] were imprisoned for this crime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ranchdivaoutfitters.com/cattleannielittlebritches.html |title=Cattle Annie & Little Britches, taken from Lee Paul |publisher=ranchdivaoutfitters.com |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875 most members of the nation moved to Indian Territory, a large area reserved to receive tribes displaced from east of the Mississippi River and elsewhere. The warriors resisted the loss of their freedom and culture, but gradually adapted to reservations.

The Pawnee tribal economic activities throughout the year alternated between farming crops and hunting [[American bison|buffalo]].\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Pawnee numbered more than 60,000&nbsp;people and were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the west. Although dominating the [[Loup River|Loup (ickari\u02be)]] and [[Platte River|Platte (k\u00edckatuus)]] river areas for centuries, they later suffered from increasing encroachment and attrition by their numerically superior, nomadic enemies: the [[Sioux]] (or [[Lakota people|Lakota (p\u00e1hriksukat / paah\u00edksukat)]] (\"cut throat / cuts the throat\"), [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne (s\u00e1he / s\u00e1hi)]], and [[Arapaho|Arapaho (s\u00e1ri\u02beitihka)]] (\"dog eater\"); the Pawnee called these collectively as c\u00e1rarat (\"enemy tribe\") or cahriksuupi\u00edru\u02be (\"[[enemy]]\"). The Pawnee were occasionally at war with the [[Comanche|Comanche (raar\u00edhta\u02be)]] and [[Kiowa|Kiowa (k\u00e1\u02beiwa)]] farther south. They had suffered many losses due to Eurasian infectious diseases brought by the expanding Europeans, and by 1860, the Pawnee population was reduced to 4,000. It further decreased, because of disease, crop failure, and warfare, to approximately 2,400 by 1873, after which time the Pawnee were forced to move to Indian Territory in [[Oklahoma]]. Many Pawnee warriors enlisted to serve as Indian scouts in the [[US Army]] to track and fight their tribal enemies resisting [[European-American]] expansion on the [[Great Plains]].\n\n==Government==\nThere are approximately 3,200&nbsp;enrolled Pawnee and nearly all reside in Oklahoma.

In response to pressures from the [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]] and [[United States|Americans]], as well as neighboring tribes, the Pawnee began to draw closer together.\n\n===Bands===\n[[File:Pawnee01.png|thumb|Tribal territory of the Pawnee and tribes in [[Nebraska]]]]\n\n;South Bands: called ''Tuha\u00e1wit'' (\"East Village People\") by the Skidi-Federation\n* '''C\u00e1wii\u02bei''' (S.B. dialect), '''Cawi\u00ed''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Cawi''', '''Chaui''', '''Chawi''',<ref name=ohs/> or '''Tsawi''' (\u2018People in the Middle\u2019, also called \"Grand Pawnee\")\n* '''K\u00edtkehahki''' (S.B. dialect), '''K\u00edtkahaahki''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Kitkahaki''','''Kitkehahki''', or '''Kitkehaxki''' (\u2018Little Muddy Bottom Village\u2019, \u2018Little Earth Lodge Village\u2019, often called \"Republican Pawnee\")\n** Kitkehahkis\u00faraariksisu\u02be (S.B. dialect) or K\u00edtkahaahkisuraariksisu\u02be (Sk. dialect) (Kitkahahki band proper, literally \u2018real Kitkahahki\u2019 \u2013 the larger of two late 19th&nbsp;century divisions of the Kitkahahki band)\n** Kitkehahkiripacki (S.B. dialect) or K\u00edtkahaahkiripacki (Sk. dialect) (literally \u2018Little Kitkahahki\u2019 \u2013 a small Kitkahahki group that split off from the main band) \n* '''Piitahawiraata''' (S.B. dialect), '''Pi\u00edtahaaw\u00ecraata''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Pitahawirata''' or '''Pitahauirata''' (\u2018People Downstream\u2019, \u2018Man-Going-East\u2019, derived from ''Pita'' \u2013 \u2018Man\u2019 and ''Rata'' \u2013 \u2018screaming\u2019, the French called them \"Tapage Pawnee\" \u2013 \u2018Screaming, Howling Pawnee\u2019, later English-speaking Americans \"Noisy Pawnee\")<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|361}}\n** Piitahawiraata, Pi\u00edtahaaw\u00ecraata, Pitahaureat, Pitahawirata,<ref name=ohs/> (Pitahaureat proper, leading group)\n** Kawarakis (derived from the [[Arikara language]] ''Kawarusha'' - \u2018Horse\u2019 and [[Pawnee language]] ''Kish'' - \u2018People\u2019, some Pawnee argued that the Kawarakis spoke like the [[Arikara]] living to the north, so perhaps they belonged to the refugees (1794\u20131795) from [[Lakota people|Lakota]] aggression, who joined their Caddo kin living south)\n\n;[[Skidi|Skidi-Federation]] or Skiri:  the northernmost band;<ref name=ohs/> called themselves ''Ck\u00edrihki Kuuru\u00fariki'' (\"Look like wolves People\") and were known by the South Bands as ''Cki\u00edri'' (\"Wolf People\") (both names derived from ''Ckirir /Tski'ki'' \u2013 \"Wolf\" or ''Tskirirara'' \u2013 \"Wolf-in-Water\", therefore called ''Loups'', (\"Wolves\") by the French and ''Wolf Pawnee'' by English-speaking Americans),<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|463}} \n* Turikaku (\u2018Center Village\u2019)\n* Kitkehaxpakuxtu (\u2018Old Village\u2019 or \u2018Old-Earth-Lodge-Village\u2019)\n* Tuhitspiat or Tuhricpii\u02beat (S.B. dialect) (\u2018Village-Stretching-Out-in-the-Bottomlands\u2019, \u2018Village Across Bottomland\u2019, \u2018Village In The Bottoms\u2019)\n* Tukitskita (\u2018Village-on-Branch-of-a-River\u2019)\n* Tuhawukasa (\u2018Village-across-a-Ridge\u2019 or \u2018Village-Stretching-across-a-Hill\u2019)\n[[File:Pawnee father and son 1912.jpg|thumb|Pawnee father and son, 1912]]\n* Arikararikutsu (\u2018Big-Antlered-Elk-Standing\u2019)\n* Arikarariki (\u2018Small-Antlered-Elk-Standing\u2019)\n* Tuhutsaku (\u2018Village-in-a-Ravine\u2019)\n* Tuwarakaku (\u2018Village-in-Thick-Timber\u2019)\n* Akapaxtsawa (\u2018Buffalo-Skull-Painted-on-Tipi\u2019)\n* Tskisarikus (\u2018Fish-Hawk\u2019)\n* Tstikskaatit (\u2018Black-Ear-of-Corn,\u2019 i.e.\u2018[[Maize|Corn]]-black\u2019)\n* Turawiu (was only part of a village)\n* Pahukstatu or P\u00e1hukstaatu\u02be (S.B. dialect) (\u2018Pumpkin-Vine Village\u2019, did not join the Skidi and remained politically independent, but in general were counted as Skidi)\n* P\u00e1hukstaatu\u02be (Sk. dialect) (\u2018Squash Vine Village\u2019)\n* Tskirirara (\u2018Wolf-in-Water\u2019, although the Skidi-Federation got its name from them, they remained politically independent, but were counted within the Pawnee as Skidi)\n* [[Panismaha]] (also ''Panimaha'', by the 1770s this group of the Skidi Pawnee had broken off and moved toward Texas, where they allied with the Taovaya, the Tonkawa, Yojuane and other Texas tribes)\n\n===Villages===\n[[File:pawnee village soil resistivity image.jpg|thumb|left|Geophysical image depicting the subsurface archaeological footprint of Pawnee earth lodges and associated features, of a late 18th and early 19th&nbsp;century village.]]\nThe Pawnee had a sedentary lifestyle combining village life and seasonal hunting, which had long been established on the Plains. [[Archeology]] studies of ancient sites have demonstrated the people lived in this pattern for nearly 700&nbsp;years, since about 1250&nbsp;CE.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\nThe Pawnee generally settled close to the rivers and placed their lodges on the higher banks. They built [[earth lodge]]s that by historical times tended to be oval in shape; at earlier stages, they were rectangular. They constructed the frame, made of 10\u201315&nbsp;posts set some {{convert|10|feet}} apart, which outlined the central room of the lodge. Lodge size varied based on the number of poles placed in the center of the structure. Most lodges had 4, 8, or 12&nbsp;center-poles. A common feature in Pawnee lodges were four painted poles, which represented the four [[cardinal directions]] and the four major star gods (not to be confused with [[Creator deity|the Creator]]). A second outer ring of poles outlined the outer circumference of the lodge. Horizontal beams linked the posts together.\n[[File:Pawnee lodge.jpg|thumb|Pawnee lodges near [[Genoa, Nebraska]] (1873)]]\n\nThe frame was covered first with smaller poles, tied with willow withes. The structure was covered with thatch, then earth. A hole left in the center of the covering served as a combined chimney / smoke vent and skylight. The door of each lodge was placed to the east and the rising sun. A long, low passageway, which helped keep out outside weather, led to an entry room that had an interior buffalo-skin door on a hinge. It could be closed at night and wedged shut. Opposite the door, on the west side of the central room, a [[bison|buffalo]] skull with horns was displayed. This was considered [[Shamanism among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|great medicine]].\n\nMats were hung on the perimeter of the main room to shield small rooms in the outer ring, which served as sleeping and private spaces. The lodge was semi-subterranean, as the Pawnee recessed the base by digging it approximately {{convert|3|feet|4=0|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=on}} below ground level, thereby insulating the interior from extreme temperatures. Lodges were strong enough to support adults, who routinely sat on them, and the children who played on the top of the structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Prairie Logbooks |last=Carleton |first=James Henry |authorlink=James Henry Carleton |year=1983 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6314-7}}</ref> (See photo above.)\n\nAs many as 30\u201350&nbsp;people might live in each lodge, and they were usually of related families. A village could consist of as many as 300\u2013500&nbsp;people and 10\u201315&nbsp;households. Each lodge was divided in two (the north and south), and each section had a head who oversaw the daily business. Each section was further subdivided into three duplicate areas, with tasks and responsibilities related to the ages of women and girls, as described below. The membership of the lodge was quite flexible.\n\nThe tribe went on buffalo hunts in summer and winter. Upon their return, the inhabitants of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations of support for the wife (and family they married into), but could always go back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When young couples married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Pawnee are a [[matrilineal]] people. Ancestral descent is traced through the mother, and children are considered born into the mother's clan and are part of her people. Traditionally, a young couple moved into the bride's parents' lodge. People work together in collaborative ways, marked by both independence and cooperation, without coercion. Both women and men are active in political life, with independent decision-making responsibilities.\n\nWithin the lodge, each north-south section had areas marked by activities of the three classes of women:\n*Mature women (usually married and mothers), who did most of the labor;\n*Young single women, just learning their responsibilities; and\n*Older women, who looked after the young children.\n\nAmong the collection of lodges, the political designations for men were essentially between:\n*the Warrior Clique; and\n*the Hunting Clique.\n\nWomen tended to be responsible for decisions about resource allocation, trade, and inter-lodge social negotiations. Men were responsible for decisions which pertained to hunting, war, and spiritual/health issues.\n\nWomen tended to remain within a single lodge, while men would typically move between lodges. They took multiple sexual partners in serially monogamous relationships.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe Pawnee women were skilled horticulturalists and cooks, cultivating and processing ten varieties of [[maize|corn]], seven of [[pumpkin]]s and [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], and eight of [[beans]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}\n<blockquote>They planted their crops along the fertile river bottomlands. These crops provided a wide variety of nutrients and complemented each other in making whole proteins. In addition to varieties of [[flint corn]] and [[flour corn]] for consumption, the women planted an archaic breed which they called \"Wonderful\" or \"Holy Corn\", specifically to be included in the sacred bundles.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote>\n\nThe holy corn was cultivated and harvested to replace corn in the sacred bundles prepared for the major seasons of winter and summer. Seeds were taken from sacred bundles for the spring planting ritual. The cycle of corn determined the annual agricultural cycle, as it was the first to be planted and first to be harvested (with accompanying ceremonies involving priests and men of the tribe as well.)<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn keeping with their [[cosmology]], the Pawnee classified the varieties of corn by color: black, spotted, white, yellow, and red (which, excluding spotted, related to the colors associated with the four semi-cardinal directions). The women kept the different strains separate as they cultivated the corn. While important in agriculture, squash and beans were not given the same theological meaning as corn.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn 2005, the last 25&nbsp;remaining seeds of the Pawnee Eagle Corn variety were successfully sprouted. The unique taste of Eagle Corn is described as being similar to almonds with cream. In November&nbsp;2010, a traditional Pawnee ceremony with Eagle Corn soup was held in Oklahoma. According to ''[[True West Magazine]]'', Eagle Corn soup had not been available for ceremonies for 125&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://truewestmagazine.com/keepers-of-the-seed/ |title=Keepers of the Seed |last=Bommersbach |first=Jana |date=2012-04-25 |magazine=True West Magazine |access-date=2018-03-07 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting===\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Pawnee Indians Migrating - Walters 37194066.jpg|thumb|Pawnee Indians migrating, by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\nAfter they obtained horses, the Pawnee adapted their culture and expanded their [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunting seasons. With horses providing a greater range, the people traveled in both summer and winter westward to the [[Great Plains]] for buffalo hunting. They often traveled {{convert|500|miles}} or more in a season. In summer the march began at dawn or before, but usually did not last the entire day.\n\nOnce buffalo were located, hunting did not begin until the tribal priests considered the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, but no one could kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.<ref>{{cite dictionary |first=W.P. |last=Clark |article=Hunt |title=The Indian Sign Language |location=Lincoln, NE |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1982 |orig-year=1885 |edition=trade paperback |isbn=0-8032-6309-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful kills, the women processed the bison meat, skin and bones for various uses: the flesh was sliced into strips and dried on poles over slow fires before being stored. Prepared in this way, it was usable for several months. Although the Pawnee preferred buffalo, they also hunted other game, including elk, bear, panther, and skunk, for meat and skins. The skins were used for clothing and accessories, storage bags, foot coverings, fastening ropes and ties, etc.\n\nThe people returned to their villages to harvest crops when the corn was ripe in late summer, or in the spring when the grass became green and they could plant a new cycle of crops. Summer hunts extended from late June to about the first of September; but might end early if hunting was successful. Sometimes the hunt was limited to what is now western Nebraska. Winter hunts were from late October until early April and were often to the southwest into what is now western Kansas.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Caeser Bruce silver comb 1984 ohs.jpg|thumb|Ornamental [[hair comb]] by Bruce Caesar (Pawnee-[[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]), 1984, of [[German silver]], [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\nLike many other Native American tribes, the Pawnee had a cosmology with elements of all of nature represented in it. They based many rituals in the four cardinal directions. Pawnee priests conducted ceremonies based on the [[sacred]] bundles that included various materials, such as an ear of sacred corn, with great symbolic value. These were used in many religious ceremonies to maintain the balance of nature and the Pawnee relationship with the gods and spirits. In the 1890s, already in Oklahoma, the people participated in the [[Ghost Dance]] movement.\n\nThe Pawnee believed that the Morning Star and Evening Star gave birth to the first Pawnee woman. The first Pawnee man was the offspring of the union of the Moon and the Sun. As they believed they were descendants of the stars, cosmology had a central role in daily and spiritual life. They planted their crops according to the position of the stars, which related to the appropriate time of season for planting. Like many tribal bands, they sacrificed [[maize]] and other crops to the stars.\n\n====Morning Star ritual====\nThe Skidi Pawnees in Village Across a Hill<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murie, James R. |year=1981 |series=Ceremonies of the Pawnee |title=Part&nbsp;I: The Skiri |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology |issue=27 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{rp|32}} practiced [[human sacrifice]], specifically of captive girls, in the \"[[Morning Star ritual]]\". They continued this practice regularly through the 1810s and possibly after 1838 \u2013 the last reported sacrifice. They believed the longstanding rite ensured the fertility of the soil and success of the crops, as well as renewal of all life in spring and triumphs on the battlefields.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|13}} The sacrifice was related to the belief that the first human being was a girl, born of the mating of the [[Venus|Morning Star]], the male figure of light, and the unwilling [[Venus|Evening Star]], a female figure of darkness, in their [[Creation myth|creation story]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|39}}\n\nThe ritual stood outside the organization of the ceremonial year and was not necessarily an annual occurrence. The commencement of the ceremony required that a man had been commanded to sponsor it while asleep.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Typically, a warrior would dream of the Morning Star, usually in the autumn, which meant it was time to prepare for the various steps of the ritual. The visionary would consult with the Morning Star priest, who helped him prepare for his journey to find a sacrifice. During the initial meeting both would cry and cry, because they knew the missions forced upon them by divine demand were wrong to carry out.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|115}} With help from others, the warrior would capture a young unmarried girl from an enemy tribe. The Pawnee kept the girl and cared for her over the winter, taking her with them as they made their buffalo hunt. They arranged her sacrifice in the spring, in relation to the rising of the Morning Star. She was well treated and fed throughout this period.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}\n\n[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year ...\" (1907-1943) (19176154258).jpg|thumb|Miniature model of the Morning Star ritual, [[Field Museum]]]]\nWhen the morning star (either the planet [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], or some times [[Venus]])<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|38}}<ref name=Thurman1970>{{cite journal |author=Thurman, Melburn D. |title=The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star sacrifice of 1827 |journal=Nebraska History |year=1970 |pages=268\u2013280}}</ref>{{rp|footnote&nbsp;#4, p.&nbsp;277}} rose ringed with red, the priest knew it was the signal for the sacrifice. He directed the men to carry out the rest of the ritual, including the construction of a [[scaffold]] outside the village. It was made of sacred woods and leathers from different animals, each of which had important symbolism. It was erected over a pit with elements corresponding to the four cardinal directions. All the elements of the ritual related to symbolic meaning and belief, and were necessary for the renewal of life. The preparations took four days.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nMost of the actual ceremony took place in the earth lodge of the visionary, since the Pawnee villages did not have a special ceremonial lodge.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Bystanders outside dug holes in the wall and tore the roof apart to follow the elaborate ceremony.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|120}} A procession of all the men and boys \u2013 even male infants carried among the men \u2013 accompanied the girl out of the village to the scaffold. Together they awaited the morning star. When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow from a sacred bow,<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|107}} then the priest cut the skin of her chest to increase bleeding. She was shot quickly with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried to the east and placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nAbout 1820\u20131821, news of these sacrifices reached the East Coast; it caused a sensation among European Americans. Before this, US [[Indian agent]]s had counseled Pawnee chiefs to suppress the practice, as they warned of how it would upset the American settlers, who were arriving in ever greater number. Superintendent [[William Clark]] in [[St. Louis]] had pointed out the government's view on the ceremony to a visiting Pawnee delegation already in 1811.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal |author=Jones, Dorothy V. |year=1969 |title=John Dougherty and the Pawnee rite of human sacrifice: April&nbsp;1827 |journal=Missouri Historical Review |volume=63 |pages=293\u2013316}}</ref>{{rp|294}} Slowly, a Skidi faction that opposed the old rite developed.

With cavalry, steel weapons, and guns he had forced his way through the Apaches, Pueblos, and other nations of the modern southeastern US, but they had no gold. Coronado's interpreter repeated rumours (or confirmed Coronado's fantasies) that gold was to be had elsewhere in a location named [[Quivira]].\n\nAfter more than thirty days journey, Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], probably a few miles east of present-day [[Dodge City, Kansas]]. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear, but calmed down when one of Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language.\n\nCoronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling. He found Quivira \"well settled ... along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another\". Coronado believed that there were twenty-five settlements in Quivira. Both men and women Quivirans were nearly naked. Coronado was impressed with the size of the Quivirans and all the other Indians he met.

He summoned the \"Lord of Harahey\" who, with two hundred followers, came to meet with the Spanish. He was disappointed in his hopes for riches. The Harahey Indians were \"all naked \u2013 with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered\". Hyde identifies them as Awahis, the old Caddoan name for the Pawnees, possibly including the ancestors of the Skidis and the [[Arikara]]. Another group, the Guas, may have been known later as the Paniouace.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|33}} These people put up ferocious resistance when Coronado started to plunder their villages.<ref name=Winship1990/>\n\nIn 1601, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] led another ''entrada'' in search of the wealth of Quivira. He met \"Escansaques\", probably Apaches, who tried to persuade him to plunder and destroy \"Quiviran\" villages.\n\n===Arrival of horses and metal weapons===\nAbout 1670 the Apaches of the Southern Plains obtained horses and metal weapons in sufficient quantity to make them the dread of all their neighbors. For some decades the Pawnees were the victims of intensive raiding by large bands of mounted Apaches with iron weapons, and also by war parties of [[Chickasaw]]s and [[Choctaw]]s from the east who had firearms as well. The [[Dhegihan languages|Siouan]] groups that became [[Quapaw]]s, [[Osage Nation|Osage]]s, [[Omaha people|Omaha]]s, [[Ponca]]s and [[Kaw people|Kansa]]s also appeared on the Plains about this time, driven west by the expansion of the [[Iroquois]], and they too raided the Pawnees.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|54\u201356}} Archaeology indicates that pressure from hostile Apaches may have persuaded the Skidi Pawnees to move from their settlements on the [[Republican River]] to the upper [[Loup River]] in the course of the next century or so.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|43, 50, 51}} Their settlement pattern also changed from little villages of small rectangular earth-lodges to more defensible larger, compact villages of larger, circular lodges, the Skidis uniting in this way about 1680 while their close relations the Arikaras established a separate identity.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|51\u201355}}\n\n===Pawnees enslaved===\n{{main|Panis (slaves of First Nation descent)}}\nThe main form of loot was women and children, to be sold as slaves. In 1694, Apaches brought a large number of captive children to the trading fair in [[New Mexico]], but for some reason there were not enough buyers, so the Apaches beheaded all their slaves in full view of the Spaniards.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|46}} In [[French Canada]], [[Slavery in Canada|Indian slaves]] were generally called ''Panis'' (anglicized to Pawnee), as most, during this period, had been captured from the Pawnee tribe or their relations. Pawnee became synonymous with \"Indian slave\" in general use in Canada, and a slave from any tribe came to be called ''Panis.'' As early as 1670, a reference was recorded to a ''Panis'' in Montreal.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QBaTtGgyWakC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=Pawnee+slaves+in+Canada#v=onepage&q=Pawnee%20slaves%20in%20Canada&f=false |first=Carter Godwin |last=Woodson |date=July 1920 |title=The Slave in Canada |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013264 |access-date=17 November 2009}}</ref> By 1757 [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] considered that the Panis nation \"plays ... the same role in America that the Negroes do in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\">{{cite book |title=Canada's Forgotten Slaves |first1=Marcel |last1=Trudel |first2=Micheline |last2=d'Allaire |orig-year=1963 |translator=George Tombs |year=2013 |publisher=V\u00e9hicule Press |page=64}}</ref> The historian [[Marcel Trudel]] documented that close to 2,000&nbsp;\"panis\" [[slavery|slaves]] lived in [[Canada]] until the abolition of slavery in the colony in 1833.<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\" /> Indian slaves comprised close to half of the known slaves in [[French Canada]] (also called Lower Canada).\n\n===Pawnees acquire metal and horses===\n\nBy 1719 when [[Jean-Baptiste B\u00e9nard de la Harpe|de la Harpe]] led an expedition to Caddoan lands at the mouth of the [[Arkansas River]], the Pawnees had also acquired horses and metal weapons from French traders, and they were attacking Apaches in turn, destroying their villages and carrying off Apache women and children.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|57}} In 1720, [[Pierre Dugu\u00e9 de Boisbriand|Boisbriant]] reported that the Paniassas or Black Pawnees had recently captured a hundred Apaches, whom they were burning, a few each day.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|76}} de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Harpe planned to establish French trading posts at the mouth of the [[Canadian River]] and elsewhere in Caddoan territory, but this was not done and the Pawnee remained dependent on infrequent and casual traders, while their enemies \u2013 the Osages \u2013 benefited from a regular trade.\n\nIn 1720, the [[Villasur expedition]] was sent to the Pawnees in an attempt to wean the tribe away from their French connections (which had been greatly magnified in Spanish imagination). Guided mainly by Apaches, and led by an officer without experience of Indians, the expedition approached the Skidi Pawnee villages along the outflow of the [[Loup River]] into the [[Platte River]] in modern Nebraska. The expedition sent their only Pawnee slave to make contact; he did not obtain any welcome for the Spanish party and he shortly failed to return to the Spanish camp.

He reported that the Pawnee were a strong tribe and good horsemen, but, located at the far end of every trade route for European goods, were unfamiliar with Europeans and were treated like country bumpkins by their southern relatives. The mutual hatred between Pawnees and Apaches was so great that both sides were cooking and eating many of their captives.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|47}} Bourgmont's \"peace\" had little effect.\n\nIn 1739 the [[Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet|Mallet brothers]] visited the Skidi Pawnee. In 1750 the Skidis were reported to be ruled by a grand chief who had 900 warriors.\n\nFrom about 1760, [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out on the Great Plains, reducing the Skidi from eight large villages in 1725 to one by 1800.\n\n===Increasing contact with English-speakers, ongoing tribal warfare===\n[[File:Seymour Pawnees 1819.jpg|thumb|Pawnees in a parley with Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Long]]'s expedition at [[Engineer Cantonment]], near Council Bluffs, Iowa, in October 1819]]\nA Pawnee tribal delegation visited [[Thomas Jefferson|President Thomas Jefferson]]. In 1806 Lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]], [[Major G. C. Sibley]], [[Major S. H. Long]], among others, began visiting the Pawnee villages. Under pressure from Siouan tribes and European-American settlers, the Pawnee ceded territory to the United States government in treaties in 1818, 1825, 1833, 1848, 1857, and 1892. In 1857, they settled on the [[Pawnee Reservation]] along the Loup River in present-day [[Nance County, Nebraska]], but maintained their traditional way of life. They were subjected to continual raids by [[Lakota people|Lakota]] from the north and west.\n\n[[File:Sharitarish - Wicked Chief - by Charles Bird King, c1822.jpg|thumb|left|1822 portrait of [[Sharitahrish]] by [[Charles Bird King]], on display in the [[Library (White House)|Library]] of the [[White House]]]] Until the 1830s, the Pawnee in what became United States territory were relatively isolated from interaction with Europeans.

Like other groups of Native American scouts, Pawnee warriors were recruited in large numbers to fight on the Northern and Southern Plains in various conflicts against hostile Native Americans. Because the Pawnee people were old enemies of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche and Kiowa tribes, they served with the army for fourteen years between 1864 and 1877, earning a reputation as being a well-trained unit, especially in tracking and reconnaissance. The Pawnee Scouts took part with distinction in the [[Battle of the Tongue River]] during the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)]] against Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho and in the [[Battle of Summit Springs]]. They also fought with the US in the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]]. On the Southern Plains they fought against their old enemies, the Comanches and Kiowa, in the [[Comanche Campaign]].\n\n===Relocation and reservation===\n [[File:Cloud-Shield's winter count (Lakota). 1873-74.

On one such raid, 5&nbsp;August 1873, a Sioux war party of over 1,000 warriors ambushed a Pawnee hunting party of 350&nbsp;men, women, and children. The Pawnee had gained permission to leave the reservation and hunt buffalo. About 70&nbsp;Pawnee were killed in this attack, which occurred in a canyon in present-day [[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]. The site is known as [[Massacre Canyon]]. Because of the ongoing hostilities with the Sioux and encroachment from American settlers to the south and east, the Pawnee decided to leave their Nebraska reservation in the 1870s and settle on a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]], located in what is today Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1874, the Pawnee requested relocation to [[Indian Territory]] (Oklahoma), but the stress of the move, diseases and poor conditions on their reservation reduced their numbers even more. During this time, outlaws often smuggled whiskey to the Pawnee.
