In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107\u2013106, Bird stole an inbound pass.

Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season-recap-index|title=NBA Season Recaps: 1946-2018 |work=NBA|access-date=November 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with [[Magic Johnson]] banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at [[Boston Garden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=birdla01&year=1988|title=Celtics-Lakers Box Score|website=Basketball Reference}}</ref> The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since [[Bill Russell]] squared off against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime offense]] amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek [[limousine]] and challenges him to a one-on-one match.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Late career (1988\u20131992)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe 1987-1988 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's [[Dominique Wilkins]]. Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBird's [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. During the 1992 [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] semi-finals against the [[1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]], Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n==International play==\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Jordan]] and other NBA stars to play for the United States [[United States men's national basketball team|basketball team]] in that year's [[1992 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |title=Dream Team a star-studded sight to behold for gazers on, off court |work=Sports Illustrated |date=July 20, 2011 |access-date=June 28, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427135245/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |archivedate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete.

He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three [[NBA championship]]s and two [[NBA Finals MVP]] awards.

The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1987_finals.html |title=1987 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|website=Basketball Reference|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Celtics would fall short in 1988 losing to the [[1987\u201388 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season-recap-index|title=NBA Season Recaps: 1946-2018 |work=NBA|access-date=November 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with [[Magic Johnson]] banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at [[Boston Garden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=birdla01&year=1988|title=Celtics-Lakers Box Score|website=Basketball Reference}}</ref> The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since [[Bill Russell]] squared off against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime offense]] amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek [[limousine]] and challenges him to a one-on-one match.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Late career (1988\u20131992)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe 1987-1988 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's [[Dominique Wilkins]]. Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBird's [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. During the 1992 [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] semi-finals against the [[1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]], Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n==International play==\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Jordan]] and other NBA stars to play for the United States [[United States men's national basketball team|basketball team]] in that year's [[1992 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |title=Dream Team a star-studded sight to behold for gazers on, off court |work=Sports Illustrated |date=July 20, 2011 |access-date=June 28, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427135245/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |archivedate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete.

S.) \u2013 summer 1932) was a [[Ukrainian nobility|Ukrainian noblewoman]], philanthropist, and collector of folklore. She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring a professional curator, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. The following year she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].     \n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943. The agricultural school she organized is now known as the Lubny Forestry College.\n\n==Early life==\nKateryna Nikolaevna von Reiser, known as Katya, was born 19 February 1852 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]{{#tag:ref|Though other sources give other years for von Reiser's birth,{{sfn|\u0406\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|2016|p=27}} Astryab states Katya was 7 years old when her father died, i.e. born 1852.

S.) \u2013 summer 1932) was a [[Ukrainian nobility|Ukrainian noblewoman]], philanthropist, and collector of folklore. She established the first private museum in Ukraine to house her collection of artifacts and was particularly known for her collection of [[pysanka|pysanky]], Easter eggs decorated with Ukrainian folk art. Born in [[Lubny]] to the von Reiser family, which had a long history of military service to the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsars]], she was educated at home, studying in her parents' library and with select tutors. After her father died in 1859, together with her mother, brother, and maternal grandmother she moved to the Lodygyn/Lodigine family estates in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver province]] of the Russian Empire, near Moscow. There at the age of 14, von Reiser established a school for the former serfs of the estate and a public hospital.\n\nIn 1869, von Reiser became acquainted with [[Nikolai Georgievich Skarzhynsky]], a Ukrainian nobleman and soldier. Through his circle of friends, she decided to continue her education and passed her [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] studies, entering the [[Bestuzhev Courses]]. They married in 1874 and later would have five children together. Five years later, he was transferred from St. Petersburg back to Ukraine. Though she did not finish her studies, Skarzhynska had developed an interest in culture and moving back to her father's estate, ''Kruglik'', inspired her to begin collecting folk art and other artifacts. Consulting with ethnographers, archaeologists and historians, she financed archaeological excavations and amassed a large collection of items. Failing to interest local authorities in establishing a museum to house them, she created the first private museum in Ukraine in 1880. Hiring a professional curator, Skarzhynska assisted in developing the collection until 1905. The following year she transferred her materials to the Museum of Natural History of Poltava Provincial [[Zemstvo]].\n\nIn addition to her work with the museum, Skarzhynska was involved in creating schools in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]]. She established an agricultural school in the village of [[Terny]] in 1891; created a school for prisoners in the Lubny city jail; and built a public school on her estate at Kruglik, while organizing adult education courses. Her works were honored by the Russian government with the gold medal and ribbon of the [[Order of Saint Anna]]. In 1905, Skarzhynska separated from her husband and moved with her younger children, first to Italy, and then to Switzerland. She continued her philanthropic endeavors creating a shelter for displaced Russians living abroad, opened schools for Russian children, founded an organization for emigrants to network, created a tuberculosis hospital and various Russian printing houses to assist her compatriots who were living outside of Russia. At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Ukraine, but as a former noble, was robbed by revolutionary troops and left penniless. Though granted a small pension by [[Lenin]], it was later revoked and she died in 1932 during the [[Holodomor]].     \n\nMostly forgotten in the Soviet era, Skarzhynska is now recognized for her impact on the cultural and scientific development of Ukraine. In 1989 a street in Lubny was named after her. Her papers are housed at the Poltava Regional Studies Museum. The elementary school she founded on the ''Kruglik'' estate operated as a public school until 1943. The agricultural school she organized is now known as the Lubny Forestry College.\n\n==Early life==\nKateryna Nikolaevna von Reiser, known as Katya, was born 19 February 1852 [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]{{#tag:ref|Though other sources give other years for von Reiser's birth,{{sfn|\u0406\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|2016|p=27}} Astryab states Katya was 7 years old when her father died, i.e. born 1852.

It is set in 1912 at a fictional Cambridge college, St Angelicus.  The novel was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize.\n\n==Plot==\nFred Fairly, a Junior Fellow of St Angelicus ('Angels'), a fictional Cambridge college, is a physicist whose research focuses on the exciting modern field of [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]]. As Fred cycles along the Guestingley Road in the dark, an unlit farmer's cart pulls out of a gateway into his path, causing him to crash into a stranger - a young woman by the name of Daisy Saunders. Both are knocked unconscious, and are taken in by the wife of Professor Wrayburn who lives nearby. Noting that the young woman wears a wedding ring, she incorrectly assumes that the pair are husband and wife and she puts them into the same bed to recover. On coming round, Fred immediately falls in love with Daisy, but she leaves without giving an address and he has no way of locating her.\n\nDaisy is in fact an impoverished young woman from South London, who has been working towards a nursing position at Blackfriars Hospital. She is single but wears a wedding ring to fend off unwanted male attention. At the time of the accident she was cycling with Thomas Kelly, a seedy journalist, who quickly made himself scarce.\n\nWhile Fred is recuperating in a nursing home, Daisy returns to Cambridge and gets a job at the local asylum. She visits Mrs Wrayburn, quickly realises that the household chores are a burden to her, and offers to take them over in return for lodging. As soon as Fred learns of her return, he proposes marriage. Daisy says that she will consider it.\n\nThe driver of the farmer's cart that caused the accident has not been found and this draws the interest of Dr Matthews, Provost of St James and teller of ghost stories. It also draws the attention of the local police who open an investigation. In the ensuing trial, Fred, Daisy and Mrs Wrayburn are called as witnesses.  While Daisy is in the witness box, the police unexpectedly introduce Thomas Kelly, whom she denies knowing.  But Kelly, determined to cause Daisy damage, testifies that he is waiting for her to come to him at a local hotel where rooms are rented by the hour. Fred is horrified. He leaves the courtroom and waits in a nearby cafe for three hours until Kelly emerges. When he does, Fred knocks him unconscious.\n\nFollowing the trial, Daisy loses her job. She responds indignantly to Fred's questioning and their relationship appears to be at an end. Daisy says goodbye to Mrs Wrayburn and with no job and no money walks the several miles back to the station for a train to London. After losing her way, she finds herself outside a side gate of Fred's college, St Angelicus, which mysteriously stands open for only the third time in the college's long history.  She hears a cry, goes in and helps the blind master of the college who has fainted. The incident has taken only five minutes - a delay just long enough for her to run into Fred, who is returning from a physics lecture.\n\n==Principal characters==\n* Frederick Aylmer \"Fred\" Fairly: 25-year-old lecturer in practical physics and junior fellow at St Angelicus\n* Daisy Saunders: penniless nursing student\n* Thomas Kelly: disreputable journalist\n* Dr Matthews: Provost of St James, medievalist, paleographer, teller of ghost stories\n* Professor Henry Flowerdew: Fred's mentor, a strict [[Ernst Mach|Machian]]\n* George Turner: farmer, owner of the cart that collided with Fred and Daisy\n* Herbert and Venetia Wrayburn: residents of Cambridge\n* James Elder: An attempted suicide\n* Dr Sage: a [[Quackery|quack]].\n\n==Background==\nFitzgerald's inspiration for the opening of the novel came when she saw through a Cambridge bus window some cows in ecstasy over willow branches that had been broken off by strong winds; she viewed this as an instance of reason giving way to imagination in 'this orderly University city'.{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=360-361}}\n\nFitzgerald was familiar with the Cambridge of the 1910s, having researched it for ''The Knox Brothers'' (1977), a history of her Knox relatives.

Their offices are located in the [[West Wing]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and Mrs. Monika Babi\u0161ov\u00e1 Visit the White House (40353221263).jpg|thumb|Photographers and videographers in the [[Oval Office]] in 2019]]\n[[File:White House Press Corp outside.jpg|thumb|Semi-permanent setup of press corps on the west end of the north White House lawn, from where live media broadcasts with the White House are typically delivered]]\nThe [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] or a deputy generally holds a weekday news briefing in the [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]]. The room currently seats 49 reporters. Each seat is assigned to a news gathering organization, with the most prominent organizations occupying the first two rows. Reporters who do not have an assigned seat may stand. Often a smaller group of reporters known as the \"White House press pool\" is assembled to report back to their colleagues on events where the venue would make open coverage logistically difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhen a new U.S. president is elected, some news organizations change their correspondents, most often to the reporter who had been assigned to cover the new president during the preceding campaign. For example, after the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], ABC News moved [[Jake Tapper]], who had covered [[Barack Obama]] during his presidential campaign, to the White House correspondent's position.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe White House press corps had their first duties in the White House in the early 1900s. An [[urban legend]] exists of [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whca.net/history.htm | title = HISTORY OF THE WHCA | work = WHCA | publisher = White House Correspondents' Association  | date = }}</ref>\n\n==Correspondents==\n\n===Current===\n\nOrdered by [[James S.

Their offices are located in the [[West Wing]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and Mrs. Monika Babi\u0161ov\u00e1 Visit the White House (40353221263).jpg|thumb|Photographers and videographers in the [[Oval Office]] in 2019]]\n[[File:White House Press Corp outside.jpg|thumb|Semi-permanent setup of press corps on the west end of the north White House lawn, from where live media broadcasts with the White House are typically delivered]]\nThe [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] or a deputy generally holds a weekday news briefing in the [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]]. The room currently seats 49 reporters. Each seat is assigned to a news gathering organization, with the most prominent organizations occupying the first two rows. Reporters who do not have an assigned seat may stand. Often a smaller group of reporters known as the \"White House press pool\" is assembled to report back to their colleagues on events where the venue would make open coverage logistically difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhen a new U.S. president is elected, some news organizations change their correspondents, most often to the reporter who had been assigned to cover the new president during the preceding campaign. For example, after the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], ABC News moved [[Jake Tapper]], who had covered [[Barack Obama]] during his presidential campaign, to the White House correspondent's position.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe White House press corps had their first duties in the White House in the early 1900s. An [[urban legend]] exists of [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whca.net/history.htm | title = HISTORY OF THE WHCA | work = WHCA | publisher = White House Correspondents' Association  | date = }}</ref>\n\n==Correspondents==\n\n===Current===\n\nOrdered by [[James S.

His tutor had been the learned Dr. [[Andrew Dalzell]] and James Maitland then attended the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, completing his education in Paris where, it is said, he became radicalised.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\n\nUpon his return home in 1780, he was admitted a member of the [[Faculty of Advocates]] and successfully stood for election to parliament the same year. From 1780 until 1784 he was a member of parliament representing [[Newport (Cornwall) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] and from 1784 to 1789, [[Malmesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Malmesbury]]. In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] he supported the prominent Whig [[Charles James Fox|Charles Fox]] and took an active part in debate and was one of the managers of the [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings]].\n\nFrom 1789, in the [[House of Lords]], where he was a [[representative peer]] for Scotland, he was prominent as an opponent of the policy of [[William Pitt the Younger]] and the English government with regard to France. He was a frequent speaker and also distinguished himself by his active opposition to the ''Habeas Corpus'' Suspension Act, the Sedition Bill, and other measures.
