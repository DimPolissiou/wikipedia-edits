{"title_page": "Collatz conjecture", "text_new": "{{unsolved|mathematics|Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values?}}\nThe '''Collatz conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] in [[mathematics]] that concerns a [[sequence]] defined as follows: start with any [[positive integer]] {{mvar|n}}. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is [[Parity (mathematics)|even]], the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  The conjecture is that no matter what value of {{mvar|n}}, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe conjecture is named after [[Lothar Collatz]], who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.<ref>{{cite web|last1= O'Connor|first1=J.J.|last2=Robertson|first2=E.F.|title=Lothar Collatz|year=2006|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Collatz.html|publisher=St Andrews University School of Mathematics and Statistics, Scotland}}</ref>  It is also known as the '''{{math|3''n'' + 1}} problem''', the '''{{math|3''n'' + 1}} conjecture''', the '''Ulam conjecture''' (after [[Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]]), '''Kakutani's problem''' (after [[Shizuo Kakutani]]), the '''Thwaites conjecture''' (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), '''Hasse's algorithm''' (after [[Helmut Hasse]]), or the '''Syracuse problem'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maddux |first1=Cleborne D. |last2=Johnson |first2=D.

The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone sequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events.  (It does rigorously establish that the [[p-adic numbers|2-adic]] extension of the Collatz process has two division steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting values.)\n\nAnd even if the probabilistic reasoning were rigorous, this would still imply only that the conjecture is [[almost surely]] true for any given integer, which does not necessarily imply that it is true for all integers.\n\n[[Terence Tao]] (2019) proved using probability that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values.

The resulting function {{mvar|f}} maps from [[odd number]]s to odd numbers.  Now suppose that for some odd number {{mvar|n}}, applying this operation {{mvar|k}} times yields the number 1 (that is, {{math|''f''{{isup|''k''}}(''n'') {{=}} 1}}).

The parity sequence is the same as the sequence of operations.\n\nUsing this form for {{math|''f''(''n'')}}, it can be shown that the parity sequences for two numbers {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} will agree in the first {{mvar|k}} terms if and only if {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are equivalent modulo {{math|2<sup>''k''</sup>}}.  This implies that every number is uniquely identified by its parity sequence, and moreover that if there are multiple Hailstone cycles, then their corresponding parity cycles must be different.<ref name=\"Lagarias (1985)\"/><ref>{{citation\n | last = Terras | first = Riho\n | year = 1976\n | title = A stopping time problem on the positive integers\n | journal =  Acta Arithmetica\n | mr = 0568274\n | volume = 30\n | issue = 3\n | pages = 241\u2013252\n | url = http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa30/aa3034.pdf | doi=10.4064/aa-30-3-241-252\n}}</ref>\n\nApplying the {{mvar|f}} function {{mvar|k}} times to the number {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2<sup>''k''</sup>''a'' + ''b''}} will give the result {{math|3<sup>''c''</sup>''a'' + ''d''}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the result of applying the {{mvar|f}} function {{mvar|k}} times to {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} is how many increases were encountered during that sequence (e.g. for {{math|2<sup>5</sup>''a'' + 1}} there are 3 increases as 1 iterates to 2, 1, 2, 1, and finally to 2 so the result is {{math|3<sup>3</sup>''a'' + 2}}; for {{math|2<sup>2</sup>''a'' + 1}} there is only 1 increase as 1 rises to 2 and falls to 1 so the result is {{math|3''a'' + 1}}). When {{mvar|b}} is {{math|2<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1}} then there will be {{mvar|k}} rises and the result will be {{math|2 \u00d7 3<sup>''k''</sup>''a'' \u2212 1}}. The factor of 3 multiplying {{mvar|a}} is independent of the value of {{mvar|a}}; it depends only on the behavior of {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to predict that certain forms of numbers will always lead to a smaller number after a certain number of iterations, e.g. {{math|4''a'' + 1}} becomes {{math|3''a'' + 1}} after two applications of {{mvar|f}} and {{math|16''a'' + 3}} becomes {{math|9''a'' + 2}} after 4 applications of {{mvar|f}}. Whether those smaller numbers continue to 1, however, depends on the value of {{mvar|a}}.\n\n===As a tag system===\nFor the Collatz function in the form\n\n<math> f(n) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{n}{2} &\\text{if } n \\equiv 0 \\\\[4px] \\frac{3n+1}{2} & \\text{if } n \\equiv 1. \\end{cases} \\pmod{2}</math>\n\nHailstone sequences can be computed by the extremely simple [[Tag system#Example: Computation of Hailstone sequences|2-tag system]] with production rules\n\n:{{math|''a'' \u2192 ''bc''}}, {{math|''b'' \u2192 ''a''}}, {{math|''c'' \u2192 ''aaa''}}.\n\nIn this system, the positive integer {{mvar|n}} is represented by a string of {{mvar|n}} copies of {{mvar|a}}, and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than&nbsp;2. (Adapted from De Mol.)\n\nThe Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an arbitrary finite string of {{mvar|a}} as the initial word, eventually halts (see ''[[Tag system#Example: Computation of Collatz sequences]]'' for a worked example).\n\n==Extensions to larger domains==\n\n===Iterating on all integers===\nAn extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just positive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 \u2192 0 which cannot be entered from outside, there are a total of 4 known cycles, which all nonzero integers seem to eventually fall into under iteration of {{mvar|f}}.  These cycles are listed here, starting with the well-known cycle for positive&nbsp;{{mvar|n}}:\n\nOdd values are listed in large bold.

The 0 \u2192 0 cycle is often regarded as \"trivial\" by the argument, as it is only included for the sake of completeness.\n\n===Iterating on rationals with odd denominators ===\nThe Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers which have odd denominators when written in lowest terms. \nThe number is taken to be 'odd' or 'even' according to whether its numerator is odd or even.  Then the formula for the map is exactly the same as when the domain is the integers: an 'even' such rational is divided by 2; an 'odd' such rational is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. A closely related fact is that the Collatz map extends to the ring of [[2-adic integers]], which contains the ring of rationals with odd denominators as a subring.\n\nWhen using the \"shortcut\" definition of the Collatz map, it is known that any periodic [[#As a parity sequence|parity sequence]] is generated by exactly one rational.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lagarias|first=Jeffrey|date=1990|title=The set of rational cycles for the 3x+1 problem|url=https://eudml.org/doc/206298|journal=Acta Arithmetica|volume=56|issue=1|pages=33\u201353|issn=0065-1036|doi=10.4064/aa-56-1-33-53|doi-access=free}}</ref> Conversely, it is conjectured that every rational with an odd denominator has an eventually cyclic parity sequence (Periodicity Conjecture <ref name=\"Lagarias (1985)\"/>).\n\nIf a parity cycle has length {{mvar|n}} and includes odd numbers exactly {{mvar|m}} times at indices {{math|''k''<sub>0</sub> < \u2026 < ''k''<sub>''m''\u22121</sub>}}, then the unique rational which generates immediately and periodically this parity cycle is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{3^{m-1} 2^{k_0} + \\cdots + 3^0 2^{k_{m-1}}}{2^n - 3^m}.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nFor example, the parity cycle {{nowrap|(1 0 1 1 0 0 1)}} has length 7 and four odd terms at indices 0, 2, 3, and 6. It is repeatedly generated by the fraction\n:<math>\\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^3 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \\frac{151}{47}</math>\nas the latter leads to the rational cycle \n:<math>\\frac{151}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{250}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{125}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{211}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{340}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{170}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{85}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{151}{47} </math>.\n\nAny cyclic permutation of {{nowrap|(1 0 1 1 0 0 1)}} is associated to one of the above fractions. For instance, the cycle {{nowrap|(0 1 1 0 0 1 1)}} is produced by the fraction\n:<math>\\frac{3^3 2^1 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^5 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \\frac{250}{47}</math>.\n\nFor a one-to-one correspondence, a parity cycle should be ''irreducible'', i.e., not partitionable into identical sub-cycles. As an illustration of this, the parity cycle {{nowrap|(1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0)}} and its sub-cycle {{nowrap|(1 1 0 0)}} are associated to the same fraction {{sfrac|5|7}} when reduced to lowest terms.\n\nIn this context, assuming the validity of the Collatz conjecture implies that {{nowrap|(1 0)}} and {{nowrap|(0 1)}} are the only parity cycles generated by positive whole numbers (1 and 2, respectively).\n\nIf the odd denominator {{mvar|d}} of a rational is not a multiple of 3, then all the iterates have the same denominator and the sequence of numerators can be obtained by applying the \"{{math|3''n'' + ''d''}}\" generalization of the Collatz function\n: <math> T_d(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{2} &\\text{if } x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2},\\\\[4px] \\frac{3x+d}{2} & \\text{if } x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}. \\end{cases}</math>\n\n===2-adic extension===\nThe function \n: <math> T(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{2} &\\text{if } x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\\\[4px] \\frac{3x+1}{2} & \\text{if } x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\end{cases}</math>\nis well-defined on the ring {{math|\u2124<sub>2</sub>}} of [[2-adic integers]], where it is continuous and [[Measure-preserving transformation|measure-preserving]] with respect to the 2-adic measure.

This yields a heuristic argument that every Hailstone sequence should decrease in the long run, although this is not evidence against other cycles, only against divergence.  The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone sequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events.  (It does rigorously establish that the [[p-adic numbers|2-adic]] extension of the Collatz process has two division steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting values.)\n\nAnd even if the probabilistic reasoning were rigorous, this would still imply only that the conjecture is [[almost surely]] true for any given integer, which does not necessarily imply that it is true for all integers.\n\n[[Terence Tao]] (2019) proved using probability that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values.

When {{mvar|b}} is {{math|2<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1}} then there will be {{mvar|k}} rises and the result will be {{math|2 \u00d7 3<sup>''k''</sup>''a'' \u2212 1}}. The factor of 3 multiplying {{mvar|a}} is independent of the value of {{mvar|a}}; it depends only on the behavior of {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to predict that certain forms of numbers will always lead to a smaller number after a certain number of iterations, e.g. {{math|4''a'' + 1}} becomes {{math|3''a'' + 1}} after two applications of {{mvar|f}} and {{math|16''a'' + 3}} becomes {{math|9''a'' + 2}} after 4 applications of {{mvar|f}}. Whether those smaller numbers continue to 1, however, depends on the value of {{mvar|a}}.\n\n===As a tag system===\nFor the Collatz function in the form\n\n<math> f(n) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{n}{2} &\\text{if } n \\equiv 0 \\\\[4px] \\frac{3n+1}{2} & \\text{if } n \\equiv 1. \\end{cases} \\pmod{2}</math>\n\nHailstone sequences can be computed by the extremely simple [[Tag system#Example: Computation of Hailstone sequences|2-tag system]] with production rules\n\n:{{math|''a'' \u2192 ''bc''}}, {{math|''b'' \u2192 ''a''}}, {{math|''c'' \u2192 ''aaa''}}.\n\nIn this system, the positive integer {{mvar|n}} is represented by a string of {{mvar|n}} copies of {{mvar|a}}, and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than&nbsp;2. (Adapted from De Mol.)\n\nThe Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an arbitrary finite string of {{mvar|a}} as the initial word, eventually halts (see ''[[Tag system#Example: Computation of Collatz sequences]]'' for a worked example).\n\n==Extensions to larger domains==\n\n===Iterating on all integers===\nAn extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just positive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 \u2192 0 which cannot be entered from outside, there are a total of 4 known cycles, which all nonzero integers seem to eventually fall into under iteration of {{mvar|f}}.  These cycles are listed here, starting with the well-known cycle for positive&nbsp;{{mvar|n}}:\n\nOdd values are listed in large bold. Each cycle is listed with its member of least absolute value (which is always odd) first.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! Cycle !! Odd-value cycle length !!

The 0 \u2192 0 cycle is often regarded as \"trivial\" by the argument, as it is only included for the sake of completeness.\n\n===Iterating on rationals with odd denominators ===\nThe Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers which have odd denominators when written in lowest terms. \nThe number is taken to be 'odd' or 'even' according to whether its numerator is odd or even.  Then the formula for the map is exactly the same as when the domain is the integers: an 'even' such rational is divided by 2; an 'odd' such rational is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. A closely related fact is that the Collatz map extends to the ring of [[2-adic integers]], which contains the ring of rationals with odd denominators as a subring.\n\nWhen using the \"shortcut\" definition of the Collatz map, it is known that any periodic [[#As a parity sequence|parity sequence]] is generated by exactly one rational.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lagarias|first=Jeffrey|date=1990|title=The set of rational cycles for the 3x+1 problem|url=https://eudml.org/doc/206298|journal=Acta Arithmetica|volume=56|issue=1|pages=33\u201353|issn=0065-1036|doi=10.4064/aa-56-1-33-53|doi-access=free}}</ref> Conversely, it is conjectured that every rational with an odd denominator has an eventually cyclic parity sequence (Periodicity Conjecture <ref name=\"Lagarias (1985)\"/>).\n\nIf a parity cycle has length {{mvar|n}} and includes odd numbers exactly {{mvar|m}} times at indices {{math|''k''<sub>0</sub> < \u2026 < ''k''<sub>''m''\u22121</sub>}}, then the unique rational which generates immediately and periodically this parity cycle is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{3^{m-1} 2^{k_0} + \\cdots + 3^0 2^{k_{m-1}}}{2^n - 3^m}.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nFor example, the parity cycle {{nowrap|(1 0 1 1 0 0 1)}} has length 7 and four odd terms at indices 0, 2, 3, and 6. It is repeatedly generated by the fraction\n:<math>\\frac{3^3 2^0 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^3 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \\frac{151}{47}</math>\nas the latter leads to the rational cycle \n:<math>\\frac{151}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{250}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{125}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{211}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{340}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{170}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{85}{47} \\rightarrow \\frac{151}{47} </math>.\n\nAny cyclic permutation of {{nowrap|(1 0 1 1 0 0 1)}} is associated to one of the above fractions. For instance, the cycle {{nowrap|(0 1 1 0 0 1 1)}} is produced by the fraction\n:<math>\\frac{3^3 2^1 + 3^2 2^2 + 3^1 2^5 + 3^0 2^6}{2^7 - 3^4} = \\frac{250}{47}</math>.\n\nFor a one-to-one correspondence, a parity cycle should be ''irreducible'', i.e., not partitionable into identical sub-cycles. As an illustration of this, the parity cycle {{nowrap|(1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0)}} and its sub-cycle {{nowrap|(1 1 0 0)}} are associated to the same fraction {{sfrac|5|7}} when reduced to lowest terms.\n\nIn this context, assuming the validity of the Collatz conjecture implies that {{nowrap|(1 0)}} and {{nowrap|(0 1)}} are the only parity cycles generated by positive whole numbers (1 and 2, respectively).\n\nIf the odd denominator {{mvar|d}} of a rational is not a multiple of 3, then all the iterates have the same denominator and the sequence of numerators can be obtained by applying the \"{{math|3''n'' + ''d''}}\" generalization of the Collatz function\n: <math> T_d(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{2} &\\text{if } x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2},\\\\[4px] \\frac{3x+d}{2} & \\text{if } x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}. \\end{cases}</math>\n\n===2-adic extension===\nThe function \n: <math> T(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{2} &\\text{if } x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\\\[4px] \\frac{3x+1}{2} & \\text{if } x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\end{cases}</math>\nis well-defined on the ring {{math|\u2124<sub>2</sub>}} of [[2-adic integers]], where it is continuous and [[Measure-preserving transformation|measure-preserving]] with respect to the 2-adic measure.

For each starting value {{mvar|a}} which is not a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, there is a {{mvar|k}} for which such an inequality holds, so checking the Collatz conjecture for one starting value is as good as checking an entire congruence class.  As {{mvar|k}} increases, the search only needs to check those residues {{mvar|b}} that are not eliminated by lower values of&nbsp;{{mvar|k}}.

These Y-DNA clades are frequent among other Bantu-speaking populations on the east African mainland, which points to shared origins. The remaining Comorians primarily carry the haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b-V22]], [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b-M123]], [[Haplogroup F-M89|F*(xF2, GHIJK)]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]], [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J1]], [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J2]], [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|L1]], [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q1a3]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1*]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1a*]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1a1]] and [[Haplogroup R-M207|R2]] (29.7%). Of these latter clades, the particular haplotypes that are found in Comoros were observed to be most closely related to those in South [[Iran]]. This suggests that these northern lineages were brought by early Shirazi merchants from Persia between 1200-1300 CE, as they established local trading posts on the Comoros islands. Around 6% of the Comorians also bear the [[Haplogroup O-M175|O1]] haplogroup, which indicates a minor [[Southeast Asia]]n influence.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Msaidie, Said |display-authors=etal |title=Genetic diversity on the Comoros Islands shows early seafaring as major determinant of human biocultural evolution in the Western Indian Ocean|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2011|volume=19|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.128|url= http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1009613/Comoros.pdf|quote=We reveal the Comoros population to be a genetic mosaic, the result of tripartite gene flow from the North, the East and the West. Admixture analysis of the maternal and paternal contributions indicates the gene pool to be predominately African (72%), with significant contributions from Western Asia (17%) and Southeast Asia (11%). Our study therefore provides the first unequivocal evidence that the Middle Eastern trade routes that developed along the East African coast, during the last 2 000 years, have left a genetic trace. (...) This concords withhistorical data which attests to the presence of traders from Shiraz in Iran on the Comoros, and also the Comorian's own oral traditions which recount that Shirazi princes came in ships and established colonies on the islands. On the island of Anjouan the term \"Shirazi\" is used to refer to someone of Middle Eastern appearance. There is historical evidence that 1 000 YBP Persian traders played an important role in trade along the East coast, and we therefore predict that an Iranian genetic signal will be detected among Swahili speakers at former Middle Eastern trading centres on the sub-Saharan East coast, such as the islands of Zanzibar and Kilwa off the coast of Tanzania. (...) |pmid= 20700146|pmc= 3039498}}</ref>\n\nMaternally, the Comorians primarily belong to the [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]], [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3\u20324(xMN)]] haplogroups (84.7%). These mtDNA clades are also common among other mainland Bantu populations and at roughly similar proportions. The rest of the Comorian population almost exclusively carries mitochondrial haplogroups associated with Southeast Asia (15.3%), with the [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B4a1a1-PM]], [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F3b]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M7c1c]] clades (10.6%) and the [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M(xD, E, M1, M2, M7)]] paragroup (4%) most frequent. Since no mtDNA haplogroups linked with the Middle East were observed, the gene flow from this region appears to have occurred through male-dominated trade and religious proselytisation.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\"/>\n\nAccording to Msaidie et al., admixture analysis of the maternal and paternal contributions in the Comoros sample indicates that the Comorian population was formed through tripartite gene flow over the last 2,000 years between Bantu populations in sub-Saharan coastal East Africa, settlers from Iran, and migrants from Southeast Asia. Consequently, most of the Comorian islanders' gene pool is estimated to have derived from Africa (72%), with significant contributions from Western Asia (17%) and Southeast Asia (11%). Overall, the Comorian Shirazi were found to be genetically similar to the [[Lemba people|Lemba]], a Bantu-speaking population inhabiting southeast Africa. Since the Lemba have Semitic cultural traditions and Bantu, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian associated paternal lineages have also been detected among them, the scientists suggest that they and the Comorians may have evolved through parallel demographic processes.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shirazi people]]\n* [[Kilwa Sultanate]]\n* [[Kizimkazi Mosque]]\n* [[Zanj Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Comoros]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities in Africa]]\n[[Category:Shirazi people| ]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Shirazis of the Comoros''', 138,000 people with [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] heritage, are one of the largest ethnic group inhabiting the archipelago nation of [[Comoros]] near the east African coast and they represent 17% of the total population of the [[Comoros]].<ref name=\"Tethnic\">[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/tethnic.htm Tanzania Ethnic Groups], East Africa Living Encyclopedia, accessed 28 June 2010</ref><ref name=\"Gates2010p187\">{{cite book|author1=Ari Nave|editor1=Anthony Appiah|editor2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=187\u2013188}}</ref> Their origins are linked to [[Shiraz]] and the southwestern coastal region of [[Persia]] (now [[Iran]]). 89,000 people or 11% of the population from the Comoros have [[Southeast Asian]] ancestry.

These Y-DNA clades are frequent among other Bantu-speaking populations on the east African mainland, which points to shared origins. The remaining Comorians primarily carry the haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b-V22]], [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b-M123]], [[Haplogroup F-M89|F*(xF2, GHIJK)]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]], [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J1]], [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J2]], [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|L1]], [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q1a3]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1*]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1a*]], [[Haplogroup R-M207|R1a1]] and [[Haplogroup R-M207|R2]] (29.7%). Of these latter clades, the particular haplotypes that are found in Comoros were observed to be most closely related to those in South [[Iran]]. This suggests that these northern lineages were brought by early Shirazi merchants from Persia between 1200-1300 CE, as they established local trading posts on the Comoros islands. Around 6% of the Comorians also bear the [[Haplogroup O-M175|O1]] haplogroup, which indicates a minor [[Southeast Asia]]n influence.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Msaidie, Said |display-authors=etal |title=Genetic diversity on the Comoros Islands shows early seafaring as major determinant of human biocultural evolution in the Western Indian Ocean|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2011|volume=19|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.128|url= http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1009613/Comoros.pdf|quote=We reveal the Comoros population to be a genetic mosaic, the result of tripartite gene flow from the North, the East and the West.

These mtDNA clades are also common among other mainland Bantu populations and at roughly similar proportions. The rest of the Comorian population almost exclusively carries mitochondrial haplogroups associated with Southeast Asia (15.3%), with the [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B4a1a1-PM]], [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F3b]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M7c1c]] clades (10.6%) and the [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M(xD, E, M1, M2, M7)]] paragroup (4%) most frequent. Since no mtDNA haplogroups linked with the Middle East were observed, the gene flow from this region appears to have occurred through male-dominated trade and religious proselytisation.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\"/>\n\nAccording to Msaidie et al., admixture analysis of the maternal and paternal contributions in the Comoros sample indicates that the Comorian population was formed through tripartite gene flow over the last 2,000 years between Bantu populations in sub-Saharan coastal East Africa, settlers from Iran, and migrants from Southeast Asia. Consequently, most of the Comorian islanders' gene pool is estimated to have derived from Africa (72%), with significant contributions from Western Asia (17%) and Southeast Asia (11%). Overall, the Comorian Shirazi were found to be genetically similar to the [[Lemba people|Lemba]], a Bantu-speaking population inhabiting southeast Africa. Since the Lemba have Semitic cultural traditions and Bantu, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian associated paternal lineages have also been detected among them, the scientists suggest that they and the Comorians may have evolved through parallel demographic processes.<ref name=\"Msaidie2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shirazi people]]\n* [[Kilwa Sultanate]]\n* [[Kizimkazi Mosque]]\n* [[Zanj Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Comoros]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities in Africa]]\n[[Category:Shirazi people| ]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Typo fixing, replaced: utlized \u2192 utilized - in a quote, but I'm assuming this was a copying error.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirazis_of_the_Comoros"}

He is the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most seats in the House of Commons but did not secure a majority government in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]] on 8 June 2017, when [[Theresa May]] was the party leader. Following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|general election]] on 12 December 2019 the Conservatives were able to secure a working majority of 80, taking 365 of the 650 seats. \n\nThe government is occasionally referred to with the [[metonym]] Westminster, due to that being where many of the offices of the government are situated, especially by members in the [[Scottish Government|Government of Scotland]], the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in order to differentiate it from their own.\n\n==Government in Parliament==\nA key principle of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] is that the government is responsible to Parliament. This is called [[responsible government]].\n\nThe United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the reigning monarch (that is, the king or queen who is the head of state at any given time) does not make any open political decisions. All political decisions are taken by the government and Parliament. This constitutional state of affairs is the result of a long history of constraining and reducing the political power of the monarch, beginning with [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.\n\nParliament is split into two houses: the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The House of Commons is the lower house and is the more powerful. The House of Lords is the upper house and although it can vote to amend proposed laws, the House of Commons can usually vote to overrule its amendments. Although the House of Lords can introduce bills, most important laws are introduced in the House of Commons \u2013 and most of those are introduced by the government, which schedules the vast majority of parliamentary time in the Commons. Parliamentary time is essential for bills to be passed into law, because they must pass through a number of readings before becoming law. Prior to introducing a bill, the government may run a public consultation to solicit feedback from the public and businesses, and often may have already introduced and discussed the policy in the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]], or in an [[election manifesto]] or [[party platform]].\n\n[[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] are responsible to the House in which they sit; they make statements in that House and take questions from members of that House. For most senior ministers this is usually the elected House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. There have been some recent exceptions to this: for example, cabinet ministers [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]] (First Secretary of State) and [[Lord Adonis]] (Secretary of State for Transport) sat in the lords and were responsible to that House during the government of [[Gordon Brown]].\n[[File:Crowned Portcullis.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]]]\n\nSince the start of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s reign in 1901, the prime minister has always been an elected member of Parliament (MP) and therefore directly accountable to the House of Commons. A similar convention applies to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellor of the exchequer]]. It would likely be politically unacceptable for the budget speech to be given in the Lords, with MPs unable to directly question the chancellor, especially now that the Lords have very limited powers in relation to money bills. The last chancellor of the exchequer to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]], who served as interim chancellor of the exchequer for one month in 1834.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ The Parliament Acts \u2013 UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2011.</ref>\n\nUnder the British system, the government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. It requires the support of the House of Commons for the maintenance of [[Loss of supply|supply]] (by voting through the government's budgets) and to pass [[primary legislation]]. By convention, if a government [[Motion of no confidence|loses the confidence]] of the House of Commons it must either resign or a general election is held. The support of the lords, while useful to the government in getting its legislation passed without delay, is not vital. A government is not required to resign even if it loses the confidence of the lords and is defeated in key votes in that House. The House of Commons is thus the [[responsible house]].\n\nThe prime minister is held to account during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQs) which provides an opportunity for MPs from all parties to question the PM on any subject. There are also departmental questions when ministers answer questions relating to their specific departmental brief. Unlike PMQs both the cabinet ministers for the department and junior ministers within the department may answer on behalf of the government, depending on the topic of the question.\n\nDuring debates on legislation proposed by the government, ministers\u2014usually with departmental responsibility for the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]\u2014will lead the debate for the government and respond to points made by MPs or lords.\n\nCommittees<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/ Committees \u2013 UK Parliament].

By long-standing custom, most of these powers are delegated from the sovereign to various ministers or other officers of the Crown, who may use them without having to obtain the consent of Parliament.\n\nThe head of the government, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], also has weekly meetings with the monarch, when she \"has a right and a duty to express her views on Government matters...These meetings, as with all communications between The Queen and her Government, remain strictly confidential.

This is exercised by the monarch, who also theoretically has the power to refuse assent, although no monarch has refused assent to a bill passed by Parliament since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708.\n* The power to give and to issue commissions to [[commissioned officer]]s in the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].\n* The power to command the [[Armed Forces of the United Kingdom]]. This power is exercised by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]] in the Queen's name.\n* The power to appoint members to [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]]. \n* The power to issue (and also to suspend, cancel, recall, impound, withdraw or revoke) British passports and the general power to provide (or deny) British passport facilities to British citizens and British nationals. This is exercised (in the United Kingdom, but not necessarily in the case of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] or the [[British Overseas Territories]]) by the [[Home Secretary]].\n* The royal [[prerogative of mercy]] although capital punishment has been abolished (thereby removing the need to use this power to issue pardons to commute a death penalty imposed, usually substituted into life imprisonment in lieu), this power is still used under rare circumstances (e.g. to remedy errors in sentencing calculation).\n* The power to grant (and also to cancel and annul) [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]]. \n* The power to create corporations (including the status of being a city, with its own corporation) by [[Royal Charter|royal charter]], and also to amend, replace and revoke existing charters.\n\n===Foreign powers===\n* The power to ratify and make [[Treaty|treaties]].\n* The power to [[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|declare war]] and [[Peace treaty|conclude peace]] with other nations.\n* The power to deploy the Armed Forces overseas.\n* The power to [[Diplomatic recognition|recognise states]].\n* The power to credit and receive diplomats.\n\nEven though the United Kingdom has no single constitutional document, the government published the above list in October 2003 to increase transparency, as some of the powers exercised in the name of the monarch are part of the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation Mystery lifted on Queen's powers | Politics].

However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, [[local authorities]], and the charity commissions) are legally more or less independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under [[Common Law|common law]] or granted and limited by act of Parliament, and are subject to [[European Union law]] and the [[Politics of the European Union#Competencies|competencies]] that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the courts by [[judicial review]].\n\nNevertheless, magistrates and mayors can still be arrested for and put on trial for corruption, and the government has powers to insert commissioners into a local authority to oversee its work, and to issue directives that must be obeyed by the local authority, if the local authority is not abiding by its statutory obligations.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-sends-in-commissioners-to-tower-hamlets|title = Secretary of State sends in commissioners to Tower Hamlets|date = 17 December 2014|accessdate = 10 April 2015|website = [[Gov.uk]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, as in every other [[European Union]] (EU) member state, EU officials cannot be prosecuted for any actions carried out in pursuit of their official duties, and foreign country diplomats (though not their employees) and foreign [[members of the European Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2014/509981/IPOL_IDA%282014%29509981_EN.pdf|title=The Immunity of Members of the European Parliament|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=October 2014|publisher=[[European Union]]}}</ref> are immune from prosecution in the UK under any circumstance.

This caused a dispute in recent years when the US ambassador to the UK claimed that London's [[congestion charge]] was a tax, and not a charge (despite the name), and therefore he did not have to pay it \u2013 a claim the [[Greater London Authority]] disputed.\n\nSimilarly, the monarch is totally immune from criminal prosecution and may only be sued with her permission (this is known as [[sovereign immunity]]). The monarch, by law, is not required to pay income tax, but [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has voluntarily paid it since 1993, and also pays local rates voluntarily. However, the monarchy also receives a substantial grant from the government, the [[Sovereign Support Grant]], and Queen Elizabeth II's inheritance from her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], was exempt from [[inheritance tax]].\n\nIn addition to legislative powers, HM Government has substantial influence over local authorities and other bodies set up by it, by financial powers and grants. Many functions carried out by local authorities, such as paying out housing benefit and council tax benefit, are funded or substantially part-funded by central government.\n\nEven though the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) is supposed to be independent of the government on a day-to-day level and is supposed to be politically unbiased, some commentators {{By whom|date=July 2018}} have argued that the prospects of the BBC having its funding cut or its charter changed in future charter renewals in practice cause the BBC to be subtly biased towards the government of the day (or the likely future government as an election approaches) at times.\n\nNeither the central government nor local authorities are permitted to sue anyone for [[defamation]]. Individual politicians are allowed to sue people for defamation in a personal capacity and without using government funds, but this is relatively rare (although [[George Galloway]], who was a backbench MP for a quarter of a century, has sued or threatened to sue for defamation a number of times). However, it is a criminal offence to make a false statement about any election candidate during an election, with the purpose of reducing the number of votes they receive (as with libel, opinions do not count).\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government]]\n* [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Gov.uk]]\n* [[Government spending in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[British Government frontbench]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]]\n* [[List of British governments]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Executive]]\n* [[Scottish Government]]\n* [[Welsh Government]]\n* [[Whole of Government Accounts]]\n* [[Office for Veterans' Affairs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street Official website] of [[10 Downing Street]]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers UK Government] list of ministers from GOV.UK\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/how-government-works How Government works] overview from GOV.UK\n\n{{UK heads of governments}}\n{{Departments of the United Kingdom Government|type=autocat off}}\n{{British-Irish Council}}\n{{Europe topic|Government of|title=Governments of Europe|ENG=|WLS=Welsh Government|NIR=Northern Ireland Executive|SCT=Scottish Government}}\n{{United Kingdom topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government of the United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Constitution of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Executive branches of government|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Government of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Westminster system governments|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:European governments|United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Her Majesty's Government|other central governments|Government of Canada|and|Government of New Zealand|and|Government of Australia|and|Government of Gibraltar|the use of the term|Her Majesty's Government (term)}}\n{{short description|Central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2017}} \n{{Infobox executive government\n| government_name = Her Majesty's Government<br />in the United Kingdom\n| border = central\n| image           = [[File:HM Government logo.svg|255px]]\n| caption= \n| date            = \n| state           = [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]\n| address         = [[10 Downing Street]]<br />[[London]]\n| appointed       = [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretaries of State]] and other [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] are appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch]] on the advice of the Prime Minister, if or when, and as long as, the monarch is or can be satisfied that the Prime Minister can or is able to command the confidence of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldconst/130/13005.htm |title=Fifth Committee of the Constitution Committee of the House of Lords, Session 2013-14: Constitutional implications of coalition government, ''Chapter 2''|date=5 February 2014 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref> \n| leader_title    = [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]\n| main_organ      = [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]\n| ministries      = \n| responsible     = [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmtreasy/282i/ts0104.htm |title=First Report of the Select Committee on the Treasury of the House of Commons, Session 1997-98: Accountability of the Bank of England, ''Paragraphs 7-13''|date=29 October 1997 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n| url             = {{URL|https://www.gov.uk/}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe '''Government of the United Kingdom''', formally referred to as '''Her Majesty's Government''', is the central government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

He is the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most seats in the House of Commons but did not secure a majority government in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]] on 8 June 2017, when [[Theresa May]] was the party leader. Following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|general election]] on 12 December 2019 the Conservatives were able to secure a working majority of 80, taking 365 of the 650 seats. \n\nThe government is occasionally referred to with the [[metonym]] Westminster, due to that being where many of the offices of the government are situated, especially by members in the [[Scottish Government|Government of Scotland]], the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in order to differentiate it from their own.\n\n==Government in Parliament==\nA key principle of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] is that the government is responsible to Parliament. This is called [[responsible government]].\n\nThe United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the reigning monarch (that is, the king or queen who is the head of state at any given time) does not make any open political decisions. All political decisions are taken by the government and Parliament. This constitutional state of affairs is the result of a long history of constraining and reducing the political power of the monarch, beginning with [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.\n\nParliament is split into two houses: the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The House of Commons is the lower house and is the more powerful. The House of Lords is the upper house and although it can vote to amend proposed laws, the House of Commons can usually vote to overrule its amendments. Although the House of Lords can introduce bills, most important laws are introduced in the House of Commons \u2013 and most of those are introduced by the government, which schedules the vast majority of parliamentary time in the Commons. Parliamentary time is essential for bills to be passed into law, because they must pass through a number of readings before becoming law. Prior to introducing a bill, the government may run a public consultation to solicit feedback from the public and businesses, and often may have already introduced and discussed the policy in the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]], or in an [[election manifesto]] or [[party platform]].\n\n[[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] are responsible to the House in which they sit; they make statements in that House and take questions from members of that House. For most senior ministers this is usually the elected House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. There have been some recent exceptions to this: for example, cabinet ministers [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]] (First Secretary of State) and [[Lord Adonis]] (Secretary of State for Transport) sat in the lords and were responsible to that House during the government of [[Gordon Brown]].\n[[File:Crowned Portcullis.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]]]\n\nSince the start of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s reign in 1901, the prime minister has always been an elected member of Parliament (MP) and therefore directly accountable to the House of Commons. A similar convention applies to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellor of the exchequer]]. It would likely be politically unacceptable for the budget speech to be given in the Lords, with MPs unable to directly question the chancellor, especially now that the Lords have very limited powers in relation to money bills. The last chancellor of the exchequer to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]], who served as interim chancellor of the exchequer for one month in 1834.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ The Parliament Acts \u2013 UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2011.</ref>\n\nUnder the British system, the government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. It requires the support of the House of Commons for the maintenance of [[Loss of supply|supply]] (by voting through the government's budgets) and to pass [[primary legislation]]. By convention, if a government [[Motion of no confidence|loses the confidence]] of the House of Commons it must either resign or a general election is held. The support of the lords, while useful to the government in getting its legislation passed without delay, is not vital. A government is not required to resign even if it loses the confidence of the lords and is defeated in key votes in that House. The House of Commons is thus the [[responsible house]].\n\nThe prime minister is held to account during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQs) which provides an opportunity for MPs from all parties to question the PM on any subject. There are also departmental questions when ministers answer questions relating to their specific departmental brief. Unlike PMQs both the cabinet ministers for the department and junior ministers within the department may answer on behalf of the government, depending on the topic of the question.\n\nDuring debates on legislation proposed by the government, ministers\u2014usually with departmental responsibility for the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]\u2014will lead the debate for the government and respond to points made by MPs or lords.\n\nCommittees<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/ Committees \u2013 UK Parliament].

However, the legal authority of the state that is vested in the sovereign, known as [[the Crown]], remains the source of the executive power exercised by the government.\n\nIn addition to [[Act of Parliament|explicit statutory authority]], in many areas the Crown also possesses a body of powers known as the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]], which can be used for many purposes, from the issue or withdrawal of passports to declaration of war. By long-standing custom, most of these powers are delegated from the sovereign to various ministers or other officers of the Crown, who may use them without having to obtain the consent of Parliament.\n\nThe head of the government, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], also has weekly meetings with the monarch, when she \"has a right and a duty to express her views on Government matters...These meetings, as with all communications between The Queen and her Government, remain strictly confidential.

This power is exercised by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.\n* The power to assent to and enact laws by giving [[Royal Assent|[Royal] Assent]] to [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] passed by both Houses of Parliament, which is required in order for a law to (from a passed Bill) ''make it into the Statute Books'' (i.e., to become a valid law) as an ''Act'' [of Parliament]. This is exercised by the monarch, who also theoretically has the power to refuse assent, although no monarch has refused assent to a bill passed by Parliament since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708.\n* The power to give and to issue commissions to [[commissioned officer]]s in the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].\n* The power to command the [[Armed Forces of the United Kingdom]]. This power is exercised by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]] in the Queen's name.\n* The power to appoint members to [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]]. \n* The power to issue (and also to suspend, cancel, recall, impound, withdraw or revoke) British passports and the general power to provide (or deny) British passport facilities to British citizens and British nationals. This is exercised (in the United Kingdom, but not necessarily in the case of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] or the [[British Overseas Territories]]) by the [[Home Secretary]].\n* The royal [[prerogative of mercy]] although capital punishment has been abolished (thereby removing the need to use this power to issue pardons to commute a death penalty imposed, usually substituted into life imprisonment in lieu), this power is still used under rare circumstances (e.g. to remedy errors in sentencing calculation).\n* The power to grant (and also to cancel and annul) [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]]. \n* The power to create corporations (including the status of being a city, with its own corporation) by [[Royal Charter|royal charter]], and also to amend, replace and revoke existing charters.\n\n===Foreign powers===\n* The power to ratify and make [[Treaty|treaties]].\n* The power to [[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|declare war]] and [[Peace treaty|conclude peace]] with other nations.\n* The power to deploy the Armed Forces overseas.\n* The power to [[Diplomatic recognition|recognise states]].\n* The power to credit and receive diplomats.\n\nEven though the United Kingdom has no single constitutional document, the government published the above list in October 2003 to increase transparency, as some of the powers exercised in the name of the monarch are part of the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation Mystery lifted on Queen's powers | Politics].

In practice, however, convention is that ministers must be members of either the House of Commons or House of Lords in order to be accountable to Parliament. From time to time, prime ministers appoint non-parliamentarians as ministers. In recent years such ministers have been appointed to the House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maer|first=Lucinda|date=2017-09-04|title=Ministers in the House of Lords|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05226}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:2008 Official Downing Street pic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|Main entrance of [[10 Downing Street]], the residence and offices of the First Lord of HM Treasury]]\nThe prime minister is based at [[10 Downing Street]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], London. Cabinet meetings also take place here. Most [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]] have their headquarters nearby in [[Whitehall]].\n\n==Devolved governments==\n{{Main|Devolution in the United Kingdom}}\nSince 1999, certain areas of central government have been devolved to accountable governments in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. These are not part of Her Majesty's Government, and are accountable to their own institutions, with their own authority under the Crown; in contrast, there is no devolved government in England.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Old Fire Station Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|right|Refurbishment notice at Old Fire Station, [[Oxford]], showing HM Government support.]]\n{{Main|Local government in England|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\n\nUp to three layers of elected local authorities (such as county, district and [[Parish councils in England|parish Councils]]) exist throughout all parts of the United Kingdom, in some places merged into [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. They have limited local tax-raising powers. Many other authorities and agencies also have statutory powers, generally subject to some central government supervision.\n\n== Limits of government power ==\n{{see also|Act of Parliament (UK)}}\nThe government's powers include general executive and statutory powers, [[delegated legislation]], and numerous powers of appointment and patronage. However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, [[local authorities]], and the charity commissions) are legally more or less independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under [[Common Law|common law]] or granted and limited by act of Parliament, and are subject to [[European Union law]] and the [[Politics of the European Union#Competencies|competencies]] that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the courts by [[judicial review]].\n\nNevertheless, magistrates and mayors can still be arrested for and put on trial for corruption, and the government has powers to insert commissioners into a local authority to oversee its work, and to issue directives that must be obeyed by the local authority, if the local authority is not abiding by its statutory obligations.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-sends-in-commissioners-to-tower-hamlets|title = Secretary of State sends in commissioners to Tower Hamlets|date = 17 December 2014|accessdate = 10 April 2015|website = [[Gov.uk]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, as in every other [[European Union]] (EU) member state, EU officials cannot be prosecuted for any actions carried out in pursuit of their official duties, and foreign country diplomats (though not their employees) and foreign [[members of the European Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2014/509981/IPOL_IDA%282014%29509981_EN.pdf|title=The Immunity of Members of the European Parliament|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=October 2014|publisher=[[European Union]]}}</ref> are immune from prosecution in the UK under any circumstance. As a consequence, neither EU bodies nor diplomats have to pay taxes, since it would not be possible to prosecute them for tax evasion. This caused a dispute in recent years when the US ambassador to the UK claimed that London's [[congestion charge]] was a tax, and not a charge (despite the name), and therefore he did not have to pay it \u2013 a claim the [[Greater London Authority]] disputed.\n\nSimilarly, the monarch is totally immune from criminal prosecution and may only be sued with her permission (this is known as [[sovereign immunity]]). The monarch, by law, is not required to pay income tax, but [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has voluntarily paid it since 1993, and also pays local rates voluntarily. However, the monarchy also receives a substantial grant from the government, the [[Sovereign Support Grant]], and Queen Elizabeth II's inheritance from her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], was exempt from [[inheritance tax]].\n\nIn addition to legislative powers, HM Government has substantial influence over local authorities and other bodies set up by it, by financial powers and grants. Many functions carried out by local authorities, such as paying out housing benefit and council tax benefit, are funded or substantially part-funded by central government.\n\nEven though the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) is supposed to be independent of the government on a day-to-day level and is supposed to be politically unbiased, some commentators {{By whom|date=July 2018}} have argued that the prospects of the BBC having its funding cut or its charter changed in future charter renewals in practice cause the BBC to be subtly biased towards the government of the day (or the likely future government as an election approaches) at times.\n\nNeither the central government nor local authorities are permitted to sue anyone for [[defamation]]. Individual politicians are allowed to sue people for defamation in a personal capacity and without using government funds, but this is relatively rare (although [[George Galloway]], who was a backbench MP for a quarter of a century, has sued or threatened to sue for defamation a number of times). However, it is a criminal offence to make a false statement about any election candidate during an election, with the purpose of reducing the number of votes they receive (as with libel, opinions do not count).\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government]]\n* [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Gov.uk]]\n* [[Government spending in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[British Government frontbench]]\n* [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]]\n* [[List of British governments]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Executive]]\n* [[Scottish Government]]\n* [[Welsh Government]]\n* [[Whole of Government Accounts]]\n* [[Office for Veterans' Affairs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/ GOV.UK], the UK government website\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street Official website] of [[10 Downing Street]]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers UK Government] list of ministers from GOV.UK\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/how-government-works How Government works] overview from GOV.UK\n\n{{UK heads of governments}}\n{{Departments of the United Kingdom Government|type=autocat off}}\n{{British-Irish Council}}\n{{Europe topic|Government of|title=Governments of Europe|ENG=|WLS=Welsh Government|NIR=Northern Ireland Executive|SCT=Scottish Government}}\n{{United Kingdom topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government of the United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Constitution of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Executive branches of government|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Government of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Westminster system governments|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:European governments|United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Elshad", "label": "safe", "comment": "URLs", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}
