The phrase was used sparingly at the end of [[World War II]] when describing the plans for the [[United Nations]] and the [[Bretton Woods system]] partly because of its negative associations with the failed League of Nations. However, many commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the [[Allies of World War II|World War II victors]] as a \"new world order.\"\n\nThe most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the [[Cold War]]. Presidents [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] used the term to try to define the nature of the [[Post\u2013Cold War era|post-Cold War era]] and the spirit of [[great power]] cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev's initial formulation was wide-ranging and [[Idealism (international relations)|idealistic]], but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|internal crisis of the Soviet system]]. In comparison, Bush's vision was not less circumscribed: \"A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor.

World War I had been justified not only in terms of U.S. [[national interest]], but in moral terms&mdash;to \"make the world safe for democracy\". After the war, Wilson argued for a new world order which transcended traditional great power politics, instead emphasizing collective security, democracy and self-determination. However, the [[United States Senate]] rejected membership of the League of Nations, which Wilson believed to be the key to a new world order. Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] argued that American policy should be based on human nature \"as it is, not as it ought to be\".<ref name=\"econ1\">\"The bloodhounds of history.\" ''[[The Economist]]''.

Former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] felt that this new world order was a projection of the [[American dream]] into Europe and that in its na\u00efvet\u00e9 the idea of a new order had been used to further the parochial interests of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], thus ensuring the League's eventual failure.<ref name=\"waldheim\">Kurt Waldheim. \"The United Nations: The Tarnished Image.\" ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (1984, Fall)</ref> Although some have claimed the phrase was not used at all, [[Virginia Gildersleeve]], the sole female delegate to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945, did use it in an interview with ''[[New York Times|The New York Times]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe phrase was used by some in retrospect when assessing the creation of the post-[[World War II]] set of international institutions, including the [[United Nations]]; the U.S. security alliances such as [[NATO]]; the [[Bretton Woods system]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]; and even the [[Truman Doctrine]] and [[Marshall Plan]] were seen as characterizing or comprising this new order.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n[[H.

There appear to have been three distinct periods in which it was progressively redefined, first by the Soviets and later by the United States before the Malta Conference and again after [[George H. W. Bush]]'s speech of September 11, 1990.\n# At first, the new world order dealt almost exclusively with [[nuclear disarmament]] and security arrangements. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] would then expand the phrase to include [[United Nations]] strengthening and [[great power]] cooperation on a range of [[North\u2013South divide|North\u2013South]] economic, and security problems. Implications for [[NATO]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], and [[European integration]] were subsequently included.\n# The [[Malta Summit|Malta Conference]] collected these various expectations and they were fleshed out in more detail by the press. [[German reunification]], [[human rights]] and the [[polarity (power)|polarity]] of the [[International relations|international system]] were then included.\n# The [[First Gulf War|Gulf War]] crisis refocused the term on [[superpower]] cooperation and regional crises. Economic North\u2013South problems, the integration of the Soviets into the international system and the changes in economic and military polarity received greater attention.\n\n=== Mikhail Gorbachev's formulation ===\nThe first press reference to the phrase came from Russo-Indian talks on November 21, 1988. [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] used the term in reference to the commitments made by the [[Soviet Union]] through the [[Declaration of Delhi]] of two years previous. The new world order which he describes is characterized by \"[[non-violence]] and the principles of peaceful coexistence\". He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear [[balance of terror]], dismantling of [[nuclear weapons]] systems, significant cuts in strategic arms and eventually a general and complete disarmament.<ref name=\"gandhi\">\"Gorbachev and Indian Prime Minister Hold Talks on November 19 Speeches Made at Peace Prize.\"  November 21, 1988</ref>\n\nThree days later, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article quotes [[NATO#Secretaries General|NATO Secretary General]] [[Manfred W\u00f6rner]] as saying that the Soviets have come close to accepting NATO's doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as [[conventional weapons|conventional arms]]. In his opinion, this would spur the creation of \"a new security framework\" and a move towards \"a new world order\".<ref name=\"guardian\">\"Soviets 'in arms strategy shift'\", ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 24, 1988</ref>\n\nHowever, the principal statement creating the new world order concept came from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s December 7, 1988 speech to the United Nations General Assembly. His formulation included an extensive list of ideas in creating a new order. He advocated strengthening the central role of the United Nations and the active involvement of all members&mdash;the Cold War had prevented the United Nations and its Security Council from performing their roles as initially envisioned. The de-[[ideology|ideologizing]] of relations among states was the mechanism through which this new level of cooperation could be achieved. Concurrently, Gorbachev recognized only one world economy\u2014essentially an end to [[trade bloc|economic bloc]]s. Furthermore, he advocated Soviet entry into several important international organizations, such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] and [[International Court of Justice]]. Reinvigoration of the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] role and recognition that superpower cooperation can and will lead to the resolution of regional conflicts was especially key in his conception of cooperation. He argued that the use of force or the threat of the use of force was no longer legitimate and that the strong must demonstrate restraint toward the weak. As the major powers of the world, he foresaw the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, India, China, Japan and Brazil. He asked for cooperation on [[environmental protection]], on [[debt relief]] for [[developing countries]], on disarmament of nuclear weapons, on preservation of the [[ABM treaty]] and on a convention for the elimination of [[chemical weapons]]. At the same time, he promised the significant withdrawal of Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and Asia as well as an end to the jamming of [[Radio Liberty]].\n\nGorbachev described a phenomenon that could be described as a global political awakening:\n{{quote|We are witnessing most profound social change.  Whether in the East or the South, the West or the North, hundreds of millions of people, new nations and states, new public movements and ideologies have moved to the forefront of history.  Broad-based and frequently turbulent popular movements have given expression, in a multidimensional and contradictory way, to a longing for independence, democracy and [[social justice]]. The idea of democratizing the entire world order has become a powerful socio-political force.  At the same time, the scientific and technological revolution has turned many economic, food, energy, environmental, information and population problems, which only recently we treated as national or regional ones, into global problems.  Thanks to the advances in [[mass media]] and means of transportation, the world seems to have become more visible and tangible. International communication has become easier than ever before.}}\n\nIn the press, Gorbachev was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]] giving the Fourteen Points, to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] promulgating the [[Atlantic Charter]] and to [[George Marshall]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] building the [[Western Alliance]]. While visionary, his speech was to be approached with caution as he was seen as attempting a fundamental redefinition of international relationships, on economic and environmental levels. His support \"for independence, democracy and social justice\" was highlighted, but the principle message taken from his speech was that of a new world order based on [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], tolerance and cooperation.<ref name=\"wapo1\">\"Vision on the World Stage\", ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 9, 1988</ref>\n{{quote|For a new type of progress throughout the world to become a reality, everyone must change. Tolerance is the [[alpha and omega]] of a new world order.|Gorbachev, June 1990}}\n\nA month later, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' ran a longer analysis of the speech and its possible implications. The promises of a new world order based on the forswearing of military use of force was viewed partially as a threat, which might \"lure the West toward complacency\" and \"woo Western Europe into neutered [[Neutral country|neutralism]]\". However, the more overriding threat was that the [[Western world|West]] did not yet have any imaginative response to Gorbachev\u2014leaving the Soviets with the moral initiative and solidifying Gorbachev's place as \"the most popular world leader in much of [[Western Europe]]\". The article noted as important his de-ideologized stance, willingness to give up use of force, commitment to troop cuts in Eastern Europe (accelerating political change there) and compliance with the ABM treaty. According to the article, the new world order seemed to imply shifting of resources from military to domestic needs; a world community of states based on the [[rule of law]]; a dwindling of security alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact; and an inevitable move toward European integration. The author of the ''Time'' article felt that [[George H. W. Bush]] should counter Gorbachev's \"[[Common European Home|common home]]\" rhetoric toward the Europeans with the idea of \"common ideals\", turning an alliance of necessity into one of shared values. Gorbachev's repudiation of [[expansionism]] leaves the United States in a good position, no longer having to support [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[dictator]]s and able to pursue better goals such as the environment; [[nonproliferation]] of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; reducing [[famine]] and poverty; and resolving regional conflicts.<ref name=\"time1\">\"The Gorbachev Challenge\", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', December 19, 1988</ref> In ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and [[Brent Scowcroft]]'s similarly concern about losing leadership to Gorbachev is noted and they worry that the Europeans might stop following the U.S. if it appears to drag its feet.<ref name=\"world1\">George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft. ''[[A World Transformed]]'', {{ISBN|0-679-75259-5}}, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nAs Europe passed into the new year, the implications of the new world order for the [[European Community]] surfaced. The European Community was seen as the vehicle for integrating East and West in such a manner that they could \"pool their resources and defend their specific interests in dealings with those superpowers on something more like equal terms\". It would be less exclusively tied to the U.S. and stretch \"from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to [[Brest-Litovsk]], or at least from [[Dublin]] to [[Lublin]]\".<ref name=\"ft1\">\"The Dog that Failed to Bark\", ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 10, 1989</ref> By July 1989, newspapers were still criticizing Bush for his lack of response to Gorbachev's proposals. Bush visited Europe, but \"left undefined for those on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] his vision for the new world order\", leading commentators to view the U.S. as over-cautious and reactive, rather than pursuing long-range strategic goals.<ref name=\"bg1\">\"Still searching for the Bush Doctrine\", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', July 23, 1989</ref>\n\n=== Malta Conference ===\n[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, 1989 official portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[George H. W.

Various new concepts arose in the press as elements on the new order. Commentators expected the replacement of containment with superpower cooperation. This cooperation might then tackle problems such as reducing armaments and troop deployments, settling regional disputes, stimulating economic growth, lessening East\u2013West trade restrictions, the inclusion of the Soviets in international economic institutions and protecting the environment. Pursuant to superpower cooperation, a new role for NATO was forecast, with the organization perhaps changing into a forum for negotiation and treaty verification, or even a wholesale dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact following the resurrection of the four-power framework from World War II (i.e. the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Russia]]). However, continued U.S. military presence in Europe was expected to help contain \"historic antagonisms\", thus making possible a [[European integration|new European order]].<ref name=\"list1\">Compiled from:\n* \"U.S. must get involved in shaping a new world order\", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989\n* \"New World Order Galloping Into Position\", ''Washington Post'', February 25, 1990\n* \"A Workmanlike Summit\", ''[[New York Times]]'', June 5, 1990</ref>\n\nIn Europe, German reunification was seen as part of the new order. However, [[Strobe Talbott]] saw it as more of a brake on the new era and believed Malta to be a holding action on part of the superpowers designed to forestall the \"new world order\" because of the German question.<ref name=\"time2\">\"American Abroad; Braking the Juggernaut\", ''Time Magazine'', December 18, 1989</ref> Political change in Eastern Europe also arose on the agenda. The Eastern Europeans believed that the new world order did not signify superpower leadership, but that superpower dominance was coming to an end.<ref name=\"bg2\">\"Soviet hopes are undaunted\", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989</ref>\n\nIn general, the new security structure arising from superpower cooperation seemed to indicate to observers that the new world order would be based on the principles of political liberty, self-determination and non-intervention. This would mean an end to the sponsoring of military conflicts in third countries, restrictions on global arms sales, and greater engagement in the [[Middle East]] (especially regarding [[Syria]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Israel]]). The U.S. might use this opportunity to more emphatically promote [[human rights in China]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\nEconomically, debt relief was expected to be a significant issue as East\u2013West competition would give way to North\u2013South cooperation. Economic tripolarity would arise with the U.S., [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] as the three motors of world growth. Meanwhile, the Soviet social and economic crisis was manifestly going to limit its ability to project power abroad, thus necessitating continued U.S. leadership.<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\nCommentators assessing the results of the Conference and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed. Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of \"[[status quo]]-plus\" rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control \"soaring expectations\" that Gorbachev's speech unleashed.<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\n=== Gulf War and Bush's formulation ===\n[[File:Bush troops.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Bush greeting troops on the eve of the First [[Gulf War]]]]\nBush started to take the initiative from Gorbachev during the run-up to the [[Persian Gulf War]], when he began to define the elements of the new world order as he saw it and link the new order's success to the international community's response in [[Kuwait]].\n\nInitial agreement by the Soviets to allow action against [[Saddam Hussein]] highlighted this linkage in the press. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared that this superpower cooperation demonstrates that the Soviet Union has joined the international community and that in the new world order Saddam faces not just the U.S., but the international community itself.<ref name=\"wapo2\">\"Summit Decision Signals Superpower Cooperation\", ''Washington Post'', September 2, 1990</ref> A ''New York Times'' editorial was the first to assert that at stake in the collective response to Saddam was \"nothing less than the new world order which Bush and other leaders struggle to shape\".<ref name=\"nyt1\">\"The Month that Shook the World\", ''New York Times'', September 2, 1990</ref>\n\nIn ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft notes that Bush even offered to have Soviet troops amongst the coalition forces liberating Kuwait. Bush places the fate of the new world order on the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to respond to Hussein's aggression.<ref name=\"world3\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 361\u2013364.</ref> The idea that the Persian Gulf War would usher in the new world order began to take shape. Bush notes that the \"premise [was] that the United States henceforth would be obligated to lead the world community to an unprecedented degree, as demonstrated by the [[Iraq]]i crisis, and that we should attempt to pursue our [[national interest]]s, wherever possible, within a framework of concert with our friends and the [[international community]]\".<ref name=\"world4\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 399\u2013400.</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1991, President Bush addressed [[United States Congress|Congress]] in a speech often cited as the Bush administration's principal policy statement on the new world order in the Middle East following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.<ref name=\"OrenPFnF\">[[Michael Oren]], ''[[Power, Faith and Fantasy]]'', p. 569, 2011, W W Norton & Son, {{ISBN|978-0393330304}}</ref><ref name=\"auto3\"/> [[Michael Oren]] summarizes the speech, saying: \"The president proceeded to outline his plan for maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, for providing funds for Middle East development, and for instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons.  The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory-for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights\". As a first step, Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace [[Madrid Conference of 1991|conference in Madrid]].<ref name=\"OrenPFnF\"/>\n\nA pivotal point came with Bush's September 11, 1990 \"Toward a New World Order\" speech ([[wikisource:Toward a New World Order|full text]]) to a joint session of Congress. This time it was Bush, not Gorbachev, whose idealism was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]] and to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the creation of the United Nations.  Key points picked up in the press were:\n* Commitment to U.S. strength, such that it can lead the world toward rule of law, rather than use of force. The Gulf crisis was seen as a reminder that the U.S. must continue to lead and that military strength does matter, but that the resulting new world order should make military force less important in the future.\n* Soviet\u2013American partnership in cooperation toward making the world safe for democracy, making possible the goals of the United Nations for the first time since its inception. Some countered that this was unlikely and that ideological tensions would remain, such that the two superpowers could be partners of convenience for specific and limited goals only. The inability of the Soviet Union to project force abroad was another factor in skepticism toward such a partnership.\n* Another caveat raised was that the new world order was based not on U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but really on Bush-Gorbachev cooperation and that the personal diplomacy made the entire concept exceedingly fragile.\n* Future cleavages were to be economic, not ideological, with the First and Second World cooperating to contain regional instability in the [[Third World]]. Russia could become an ally against economic assaults from Asia, [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[war on drugs|drugs]] from [[Latin America]].\n* Soviet integration into world economic institutions such as the [[G7]] and establishment of ties with the European Community.\n* Restoration of German [[sovereignty]] and [[Cambodia]]'s acceptance of the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s peace plan on the day previous to the speech were seen as signs of what to expect in the new world order.\n* The reemergence of Germany and Japan as members of the great powers and concomitant reform of the United Nations Security Council was seen as necessary for great power cooperation and reinvigorated United Nations leadership\n* Europe was seen as taking the lead on building their own world order while the U.S. was relegated to the sidelines. The rationale for U.S. presence on the continent was vanishing and the Persian Gulf crisis was seen as incapable of rallying Europe. Instead, Europe was discussing the European Community, the CSCE and relations with the Soviet Union. Gorbachev even proposed an all-European security council to replace the CSCE, in effect superseding the increasingly irrelevant NATO.\n* A very few postulated a bi-polar new order of U.S. power and United Nations [[moral authority]], the first as global policeman, the second as global judge and jury. The order would be collectivist in which decisions and responsibility would be shared.\nThese were the common themes that emerged from reporting about Bush's speech and its implications.<ref name=\"list2\">Compiled from:\n* \"Evoking the memory of Wilson and 'a new world order'\", ''Boston Globe'', September 12, 1990\n* \"Superpowers to Superpartners\", ''[[Newsweek]]'', September 17, 1990\n* \"Steps to a new world order\", ''Financial Times'', September 17, 1990\n* \"U.S. leads the new world order\", ''[[Toronto Star]]'', September 19, 1990\n* \"Europe choreographs new world order, but Bush is out of step\", ''Boston Globe'', November 21\n</ref>\n\nCritics held that Bush and Baker remained too vague about what exactly the order entailed:\n{{quote|Does it mean a strengthened U.N.? And new regional security arrangements in the gulf and elsewhere? Will the U.S. be willing to put its own military under international leadership? In the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush has rejected a UN command outright. Sometimes, when Administration officials describe their goals, they say the U.S. must reduce its military burden and commitment. Other times, they appear determined to seek new arrangements to preserve U.S. military supremacy and to justify new expenditures.}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the [[American liberalism|American left]] was calling the new world order a \"rationalization for imperial ambitions\" in the Middle East while the [[Conservatism in the United States|right]] rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of United Nations revival.<ref name=\"nyt2\">\"George Bush Meet Woodrow Wilson\", ''New York Times'', November 20, 1990</ref>  [[Pat Buchanan]] predicted that the Persian Gulf War would in fact be the demise of the new world order, the concept of United Nations peacekeeping and the U.S.'s role as global policeman.<ref name=\"world5\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 426.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the speech signified more than just the rhetoric about superpower cooperation. In fact, the deeper reality of the new world order was the U.S.' emergence \"as the single greatest power in a multipolar world\". Moscow was crippled by internal problems and thus unable to project power abroad. While hampered by economic malaise, the U.S. was militarily unconstrained for the first time since the end of World War II. Militarily, it was now a unipolar world as illustrated by the Persian Gulf crisis. While diplomatic rhetoric stressed a U.S.-Soviet partnership, the U.S. was deploying troops to [[Saudi Arabia]] (a mere 700 miles from the Soviet frontier) and was preparing for war against a former Soviet [[client state]]. Further, U.S. authority over the Soviets was displayed in 1) the unification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces, and almost open appeal to Washington for aid in managing the Soviet transition to democracy; 2) withdrawal of Soviet support for Third World clients; and 3) Soviets seeking economic aid through membership in Western international economic and trade communities.<ref name=\"la\">\"With Moscow Crippled, U.S. Emerges as Top Power\", ''[[LA Times]]'', September 12, 1990</ref>\n\nThe speech was indeed pivotal but the meaning hidden. A pivotal interpretation of the speech came the same month a week later on September 18, 1990. [[Charles Krauthammer]] then delivered a lecture in Washington in which he introduced the idea of American [[unipolarity]]. By the fall 1990, his essay was published in ''Foreign Affairs'' titled \"The Unipolar Moment\".<ref>''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23-33.</ref> It had few to do with Kuwait. The main point was the following:\n{{quote|It has been assumed that the old bipolar world would beget a multipolar world\u2026 The immediate post-Cold War world is not multipolar. It is unipolar. The center of world power is an unchallenged superpower, the United States, attended by its Western allies.<ref name=\"auto1\">''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn fact, as [[Lawrence Freedman]] commented in 1991, a \"unipolar\" world is now taken seriously. He details:\n{{quote|An underlying theme in all the discussions is that the United States has now acquired a preeminent position in the international hierarchy. This situation has developed because of the precipitate decline of the Soviet Union. Bush himself has indicated that it is the new relationship with Moscow that creates the possibility for his new order. For many analysts, therefore, the new order's essential feature is not the values it is said to embody nor the principles upon which it is to be based, but that it has the United States at its center... In effect, the debate is over the consequences of the West's victory in the Cold War rather than in the Gulf for the generality of international conflicts.<ref>Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 197.</ref>}}\n\nWashington's capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the \"basis for a ''[[Pax Americana]]''\". Indeed, one of the problems with Bush's phrase was that \"a call for 'order' from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a ''Pax Americana''\".<ref>Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 196-197.</ref> The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the \"most striking feature of the post-Cold War world\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in \"The Unipolar Moment Revisited\"<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5-20.</ref> stated that the \"moment\" is lasting and lasting with \"acceleration\".<ref name=\"auto2\">''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 6.</ref> He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: \"If today's American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the \"moment\" will last forty years at best, but he adjusted the estimation in 2002: \"Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era\".<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 17.</ref> On the latter occasion, Krauthammer added perhaps his most significant comment\u2014the new unipolar world order represents a \"unique to modern history\" structure.<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5.</ref>\n\n==== Presaging the Iraq War of 2003 ====\n[[File:JamesBaker.jpeg|thumb|left|[[James Baker]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under George H. W. Bush]]\n''[[The Economist]]'' published an article explaining the drive toward the Persian Gulf War in terms presaging the run-up to the [[Iraq War of 2003]]. The author notes directly that despite the coalition, in the minds of most governments this is the U.S.' war and [[George W. Bush]] that \"chose to stake his political life on defeating Mr Hussein\". An attack on Iraq would certainly shatter Bush's alliance, they assert, predicting calls from United Nations Security Council members saying that diplomacy should have been given more time and that they will not wish to allow a course of action \"that leaves America sitting too prettily as sole remaining superpower\". When the unanimity of the Security Council ends, \"all that lovely talk about the new world order\" will too. When casualties mount, \"Bush will be called a warmonger, an [[imperialism|imperialist]] and a bully\". The article goes on to say that Bush and [[James Baker]]'s speechifying cannot save the new world order once they launch a controversial war. It closes noting that a wide consensus is not necessary for U.S. action\u2014only a hardcore of supporters, namely [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], [[Egypt]] and Britain. The rest need only not interfere.<ref name=\"econ2\">\"New World Order Inc\", ''The Economist'', November 10, 1990</ref>\n\nIn a passage with similar echoes of the future, Bush and Scowcroft explain in ''A World Transformed'' the role of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] in attempting to avert the Persian Gulf War. Secretary-General [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] arrived at [[Camp David]] to ask what he could do to head off the war. Bush told him that it was important that we get full implementation on every United Nations resolution: \"If we compromise, we weaken the UN and our own credibility in building this new world order,\" I said. \"I think Saddam Hussein doesn't believe force will be used\u2014or if it is, he can produce a stalemate\". Additional meetings between Baker or P\u00e9rez and the Iraqis are rejected for fear that they will simply come back empty-handed once again. Bush feared that Javier will be cover for Hussein's manipulations. P\u00e9rez suggested another Security Council meeting, but Bush saw no reason for one.<ref name=\"world6\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 440.</ref>\n\n=== Following the Persian Gulf War ===\nFollowing the Persian Gulf War which was seen as the crucible in which great power cooperation and collective security would emerge the new norms of the era&mdash;several academic assessments of the \"new world order\" idea were published.\n\n[[John Lewis Gaddis]], a Cold War historian, wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' about what he saw as the key characteristics of the potential new order, namely unchallenged American primacy, increasing integration, resurgent [[nationalism]] and religiosity, a diffusion of security threats and collective security. He casts the fundamental challenge as one of integration versus fragmentation and the concomitant benefits and dangers associated with each. Changes in [[telecommunication|communications]], the international economic system, the nature of security threats and the rapid spread of new ideas would prevent nations from retreating into [[isolationism|isolation]]. In light of this, Gaddis sees a chance for the [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] predicted by [[Liberal international relations theory|liberal international relations theorists]] to come closer to reality. However, he illustrates that not only is the fragmentary pressure of nationalism manifest in the former Communist bloc countries and the [[Third World]], but it is also a considerable factor in the West. Further, a revitalized [[Islam]] could play both integrating and fragmenting roles&mdash;emphasizing common identity, but also contributing to new conflicts that could resemble the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The integration coming from the new order could also aggravate [[ecology|ecological]], [[demography|demographic]] and [[epidemic]] threats. National [[self-determination]], leading to the breakup and reunification of states (such as Yugoslavia on one hand and Germany on the other) could signal abrupt shifts in the balance of power with a destabilizing effect. Integrated markets, especially energy markets, are now a security liability for the world economic system as events affecting [[energy security]] in one part of the globe could threaten countries far removed from potential conflicts. Finally, diffusion of security threats required a new security paradigm involving low-intensity, but more frequent deployment of peacekeeping troops&mdash;a type of mission that is hard to sustain under budgetary or public opinion pressure. Gaddis called for aid to Eastern European countries, updated security and economic regimes for Europe, United Nations-based regional conflict resolution, a slower pace of international economic integration and paying off the U.S. [[Government debt|debt]].<ref name=\"gaddis\">John Lewis Gaddis. \"Toward the Post\u2013Cold War World.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 1991, Spring</ref>\n\nHowever, statesman [[Strobe Talbott]] wrote of the new world order that it was only in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that the United Nations took a step toward redefining its role to take account of both interstate relations and intrastate events. Furthermore, he asserted that it was only as an unintended postscript to Desert Storm that Bush gave meaning to the \"new world order\" slogan. By the end of the year, Bush stopped talking about a new world order and his advisers explained that he had dropped the phrase because he felt it suggested more enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the planet than he actually felt. As an antidote to the uncertainties of the world, he wanted to stress the old verities of territorial integrity, national sovereignty and international stability.<ref name=\"talbott\">Strobe Talbott. \"Post-Victory Blues.\" ''Foreign Affairs.'' December 1991 January 1992</ref> [[David Gergen]] suggested at the time that it was the [[Early 1990s recession|recession of 1991\u20131992]] which finally killed the new world order idea within the White House.

September 1997 / October 1997</ref>\n\n[[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] wrote critically of the \"new world order\" and of [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s ''[[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]]'' theory in ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'':\n:The expectation of harmony was widely shared. Political and intellectual leaders elaborated similar views. The Berlin wall had come down, communist regimes had collapsed, the United Nations was to assume a new importance, the former Cold War rivals would engage in \"partnership\" and a \"grand bargain,\" peacekeeping and peacemaking would be the order of the day. The President of the world's leading country proclaimed the \"new world order\"...\n:The moment of euphoria at the end of the Cold War generated an illusion of harmony, which was soon revealed to be exactly that. The world became different in the early 1990s, but not necessarily more peaceful. Change was inevitable; progress was not... The illusion of harmony at the end of that Cold War was soon dissipated by the multiplication of ethnic conflicts and \"[[ethnic cleansing]],\" the breakdown of law and order, the emergence of new patterns of alliance and conflict among states, the resurgence of neo-[[communist]] and [[neo-fascist]] movements, intensification of religious [[fundamentalism]], the end of the \"diplomacy of smiles\" and \"[[policy of yes]]\" in Russia's relations with the West, the inability of the United Nations and the United States to suppress bloody local conflicts, and the increasing assertiveness of a rising China. In the five years after the Berlin wall came down, the word \"[[genocide]]\" was heard far more often than in any five years of the Cold War.\n:The one harmonious world paradigm is clearly far too divorced from reality to be a useful guide to the post\u2013Cold War world. Two Worlds: Us and Them. While one-world expectations appear at the end of major conflicts, the tendency to think in terms of two worlds recurs throughout human history. People are always tempted to divide people into us and them, the in-group and the other, our civilization and those barbarians.<ref name=\"huntington\">Samuel P. Huntington.

Commenting on the [[Kosovo War|1999 U.S.-NATO bombing of Serbia]], he writes:\n{{quote|The aim of these assaults is to establish the role of the major imperialist powers\u2014above all, the United States\u2014as the unchallengeable arbiters of world affairs.

It was replaced by competing similar concepts about how the post-Cold War order would develop. Prominent among these were the ideas of the \"era of [[globalization]]\", the \"unipolar moment\", the \"end of history\" and the \"[[Clash of Civilizations]]\".<ref name=\"garfinkle\">Adam Garfinkle. \"The Present Opportunity.\" ''[[The National Interest]]''. 2001 Fall</ref>\n\n=== Viewed in retrospect ===\nA 2001 paper in ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' examined the idea of the \"new world order\" as it was presented by the Bush administration (mostly ignoring previous uses by Gorbachev). Their conclusion was that Bush really only ever had three firm aspects to the new world order:\n# Checking the offensive use of force.\n# Promoting [[collective security]].\n# Using great power cooperation.\n\nThese were not developed into a policy architecture, but came about incrementally as a function of domestic, personal and global factors. Because of the somewhat overblown expectations for the new world order in the media, Bush was widely criticized for lacking vision.<ref name=\"psq\">Eric A. Miller and Steve A. Yetiv, [http://unitedelite.net/bush.html \"The New World Order in Theory and Practice: The Bush Administration's Worldview in Transition.\"]  ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', March 2001</ref>\n\nThe Gulf crisis is seen as the catalyst for Bush's development and implementation of the new world order concept. The authors note that before the crisis the concept remained \"ambiguous, nascent, and unproven\" and that the U.S had not assumed a leadership role with respect to the new order. Essentially, the Cold War's end was the permissive cause for the new world order, but the Persian Gulf crisis was the active cause.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\n[[File:Richard Cheney 2005 official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dick Cheney]], then [[Secretary of Defense]] under George H. W. Bush]]\nThey reveal that in August 1990 U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia [[Charles W. Freeman Jr.]] sent a diplomatic cable to Washington from Saudi Arabia in which he argued that U.S. conduct in the Persian Gulf crisis would determine the nature of the world. Bush would then refer to the \"new world order\" at least 42 times from the summer of 1990 to the end of March 1991. They also note that [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] gave three priorities to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on fighting the Persian Gulf War, namely prevent further aggression, protect oil supplies and further a new world order. The authors note that the new world order did not emerge in policy speeches until after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, maintaining that the concept was clearly not critical in the U.S. decision to deploy. [[John H. Sununu]] later indicated that the administration wanted to refrain from talking about the concept until Soviet collapse was more clear.  A reversal of Soviet collapse would have been the death knell for the new order.<ref name=\"psq\"/>\n\nBush and Scowcroft were frustrated by the exaggerated and distorted ideas surrounding the new world order. They did not intend to suggest that the U.S. would yield significant influence to the United Nations, or that they expected the world to enter an era of peace and tranquility. They preferred [[multilateralism]], but did not reject [[unilateralism]]. The new world order did not signal peace, but a \"challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay\".<ref name=\"psq\"/>\n\nBush's drive toward the Persian Gulf War was based on the world making a clear choice. Baker recalls that UNSCR 660's \"language was simply and crystal clear, purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression\". Bush's motivation centered around 1) the dangers of [[appeasement]]; and 2) failure to check aggression could spark further aggression. Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection and became very emotional over [[List of war crimes#Invasion of Kuwait .28Iraq.29|Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait]]. He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability. While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats. Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\n[[File:Eduard shevardnadze.jpg|thumb|[[Eduard Shevardnadze]], then [[Soviet Foreign Minister]]]]\nThe Gulf War was also framed as a test case for United Nations credibility.  As a model for dealing with aggressors, Scowcroft believed that the United States ought to act in a way that others can trust and thus get United Nations support. It was critical that the U.S. not look like it was throwing its weight around. Great power cooperation and United Nations support would collapse if the U.S. marched on the [[Baghdad]] to try to remake Iraq. However, practically, superpower cooperation was limited. For example, when the U.S. deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] became furious at not being consulted.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\nBy 1992, the authors note that the U.S. was already abandoning the idea of collective action. The leaked draft of the [[Paul Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]]-[[Lewis Libby|Libby]] 1992 Defense Guidance Report effectively confirmed this shift as it called for a unilateral role for the U.S. in world affairs, focusing on preserving American dominance.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\nIn closing ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft sums up what his expectations were for the new world order. He states that the U.S. has the strength and the resources to pursue its own interests, but has a disproportionate responsibility to use its power in pursuit of the common good as well as an obligation to lead and to be involved.  The U.S. is perceived as uncomfortable in exercising its power and ought to work to create predictability and stability in international relations. The U.S. needs not be embroiled in every conflict, but ought to aid in developing multilateral responses to them. The U.S. can unilaterally broker disputes, but ought to act whenever possible in concert with equally committed partners to deter major aggression.<ref name=\"world7\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 565\u2013566.</ref>\n\n== Recent political usage ==\n[[Henry Kissinger]] stated in 1994: \"The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions\".<ref>World Affairs Council Press Conference, Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, April 19, 1994</ref> Then on January 5, 2009, when asked on television by CNBC anchors about what he suggests [[Barack Obama]] focus on during the current Israeli crises he replied that it is a time to reevaluate American foreign policy and that \"he can give new impetus to American foreign policy.

The phrase was used sparingly at the end of [[World War II]] when describing the plans for the [[United Nations]] and the [[Bretton Woods system]] partly because of its negative associations with the failed League of Nations. However, many commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the [[Allies of World War II|World War II victors]] as a \"new world order.\"\n\nThe most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the [[Cold War]]. Presidents [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[George H. W.

World War I had been justified not only in terms of U.S. [[national interest]], but in moral terms&mdash;to \"make the world safe for democracy\". After the war, Wilson argued for a new world order which transcended traditional great power politics, instead emphasizing collective security, democracy and self-determination. However, the [[United States Senate]] rejected membership of the League of Nations, which Wilson believed to be the key to a new world order.

There appear to have been three distinct periods in which it was progressively redefined, first by the Soviets and later by the United States before the Malta Conference and again after [[George H. W. Bush]]'s speech of September 11, 1990.\n# At first, the new world order dealt almost exclusively with [[nuclear disarmament]] and security arrangements. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] would then expand the phrase to include [[United Nations]] strengthening and [[great power]] cooperation on a range of [[North\u2013South divide|North\u2013South]] economic, and security problems. Implications for [[NATO]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], and [[European integration]] were subsequently included.\n# The [[Malta Summit|Malta Conference]] collected these various expectations and they were fleshed out in more detail by the press. [[German reunification]], [[human rights]] and the [[polarity (power)|polarity]] of the [[International relations|international system]] were then included.\n# The [[First Gulf War|Gulf War]] crisis refocused the term on [[superpower]] cooperation and regional crises. Economic North\u2013South problems, the integration of the Soviets into the international system and the changes in economic and military polarity received greater attention.\n\n=== Mikhail Gorbachev's formulation ===\nThe first press reference to the phrase came from Russo-Indian talks on November 21, 1988. [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] used the term in reference to the commitments made by the [[Soviet Union]] through the [[Declaration of Delhi]] of two years previous. The new world order which he describes is characterized by \"[[non-violence]] and the principles of peaceful coexistence\". He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear [[balance of terror]], dismantling of [[nuclear weapons]] systems, significant cuts in strategic arms and eventually a general and complete disarmament.<ref name=\"gandhi\">\"Gorbachev and Indian Prime Minister Hold Talks on November 19 Speeches Made at Peace Prize.\"  November 21, 1988</ref>\n\nThree days later, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article quotes [[NATO#Secretaries General|NATO Secretary General]] [[Manfred W\u00f6rner]] as saying that the Soviets have come close to accepting NATO's doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as [[conventional weapons|conventional arms]]. In his opinion, this would spur the creation of \"a new security framework\" and a move towards \"a new world order\".<ref name=\"guardian\">\"Soviets 'in arms strategy shift'\", ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 24, 1988</ref>\n\nHowever, the principal statement creating the new world order concept came from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s December 7, 1988 speech to the United Nations General Assembly. His formulation included an extensive list of ideas in creating a new order. He advocated strengthening the central role of the United Nations and the active involvement of all members&mdash;the Cold War had prevented the United Nations and its Security Council from performing their roles as initially envisioned. The de-[[ideology|ideologizing]] of relations among states was the mechanism through which this new level of cooperation could be achieved. Concurrently, Gorbachev recognized only one world economy\u2014essentially an end to [[trade bloc|economic bloc]]s. Furthermore, he advocated Soviet entry into several important international organizations, such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] and [[International Court of Justice]]. Reinvigoration of the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] role and recognition that superpower cooperation can and will lead to the resolution of regional conflicts was especially key in his conception of cooperation. He argued that the use of force or the threat of the use of force was no longer legitimate and that the strong must demonstrate restraint toward the weak. As the major powers of the world, he foresaw the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, India, China, Japan and Brazil. He asked for cooperation on [[environmental protection]], on [[debt relief]] for [[developing countries]], on disarmament of nuclear weapons, on preservation of the [[ABM treaty]] and on a convention for the elimination of [[chemical weapons]]. At the same time, he promised the significant withdrawal of Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and Asia as well as an end to the jamming of [[Radio Liberty]].\n\nGorbachev described a phenomenon that could be described as a global political awakening:\n{{quote|We are witnessing most profound social change.  Whether in the East or the South, the West or the North, hundreds of millions of people, new nations and states, new public movements and ideologies have moved to the forefront of history.  Broad-based and frequently turbulent popular movements have given expression, in a multidimensional and contradictory way, to a longing for independence, democracy and [[social justice]]. The idea of democratizing the entire world order has become a powerful socio-political force.  At the same time, the scientific and technological revolution has turned many economic, food, energy, environmental, information and population problems, which only recently we treated as national or regional ones, into global problems.  Thanks to the advances in [[mass media]] and means of transportation, the world seems to have become more visible and tangible. International communication has become easier than ever before.}}\n\nIn the press, Gorbachev was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]] giving the Fourteen Points, to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] promulgating the [[Atlantic Charter]] and to [[George Marshall]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] building the [[Western Alliance]]. While visionary, his speech was to be approached with caution as he was seen as attempting a fundamental redefinition of international relationships, on economic and environmental levels. His support \"for independence, democracy and social justice\" was highlighted, but the principle message taken from his speech was that of a new world order based on [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], tolerance and cooperation.<ref name=\"wapo1\">\"Vision on the World Stage\", ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 9, 1988</ref>\n{{quote|For a new type of progress throughout the world to become a reality, everyone must change. Tolerance is the [[alpha and omega]] of a new world order.|Gorbachev, June 1990}}\n\nA month later, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' ran a longer analysis of the speech and its possible implications. The promises of a new world order based on the forswearing of military use of force was viewed partially as a threat, which might \"lure the West toward complacency\" and \"woo Western Europe into neutered [[Neutral country|neutralism]]\". However, the more overriding threat was that the [[Western world|West]] did not yet have any imaginative response to Gorbachev\u2014leaving the Soviets with the moral initiative and solidifying Gorbachev's place as \"the most popular world leader in much of [[Western Europe]]\". The article noted as important his de-ideologized stance, willingness to give up use of force, commitment to troop cuts in Eastern Europe (accelerating political change there) and compliance with the ABM treaty. According to the article, the new world order seemed to imply shifting of resources from military to domestic needs; a world community of states based on the [[rule of law]]; a dwindling of security alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact; and an inevitable move toward European integration. The author of the ''Time'' article felt that [[George H. W. Bush]] should counter Gorbachev's \"[[Common European Home|common home]]\" rhetoric toward the Europeans with the idea of \"common ideals\", turning an alliance of necessity into one of shared values. Gorbachev's repudiation of [[expansionism]] leaves the United States in a good position, no longer having to support [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[dictator]]s and able to pursue better goals such as the environment; [[nonproliferation]] of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; reducing [[famine]] and poverty; and resolving regional conflicts.<ref name=\"time1\">\"The Gorbachev Challenge\", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', December 19, 1988</ref> In ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and [[Brent Scowcroft]]'s similarly concern about losing leadership to Gorbachev is noted and they worry that the Europeans might stop following the U.S. if it appears to drag its feet.<ref name=\"world1\">George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft.

The European Community was seen as the vehicle for integrating East and West in such a manner that they could \"pool their resources and defend their specific interests in dealings with those superpowers on something more like equal terms\". It would be less exclusively tied to the U.S. and stretch \"from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to [[Brest-Litovsk]], or at least from [[Dublin]] to [[Lublin]]\".<ref name=\"ft1\">\"The Dog that Failed to Bark\", ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 10, 1989</ref> By July 1989, newspapers were still criticizing Bush for his lack of response to Gorbachev's proposals. Bush visited Europe, but \"left undefined for those on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] his vision for the new world order\", leading commentators to view the U.S. as over-cautious and reactive, rather than pursuing long-range strategic goals.<ref name=\"bg1\">\"Still searching for the Bush Doctrine\", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', July 23, 1989</ref>\n\n=== Malta Conference ===\n[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, 1989 official portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[George H. W. Bush]]]]\nIn ''A World Transformed'', Bush and Scowcroft detail their crafting of a strategy aimed at flooding Gorbachev with proposals at the [[Malta Summit|Malta Conference]] to catch him off guard, preventing the U.S. from coming out of the summit on the defensive.<ref name=\"world2\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 163\u2013167.</ref>\n\nThe Malta Conference on December 2\u20133, 1989 reinvigorated discussion of the new world order. Various new concepts arose in the press as elements on the new order. Commentators expected the replacement of containment with superpower cooperation. This cooperation might then tackle problems such as reducing armaments and troop deployments, settling regional disputes, stimulating economic growth, lessening East\u2013West trade restrictions, the inclusion of the Soviets in international economic institutions and protecting the environment. Pursuant to superpower cooperation, a new role for NATO was forecast, with the organization perhaps changing into a forum for negotiation and treaty verification, or even a wholesale dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact following the resurrection of the four-power framework from World War II (i.e. the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Russia]]). However, continued U.S. military presence in Europe was expected to help contain \"historic antagonisms\", thus making possible a [[European integration|new European order]].<ref name=\"list1\">Compiled from:\n* \"U.S. must get involved in shaping a new world order\", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989\n* \"New World Order Galloping Into Position\", ''Washington Post'', February 25, 1990\n* \"A Workmanlike Summit\", ''[[New York Times]]'', June 5, 1990</ref>\n\nIn Europe, German reunification was seen as part of the new order. However, [[Strobe Talbott]] saw it as more of a brake on the new era and believed Malta to be a holding action on part of the superpowers designed to forestall the \"new world order\" because of the German question.<ref name=\"time2\">\"American Abroad; Braking the Juggernaut\", ''Time Magazine'', December 18, 1989</ref> Political change in Eastern Europe also arose on the agenda. The Eastern Europeans believed that the new world order did not signify superpower leadership, but that superpower dominance was coming to an end.<ref name=\"bg2\">\"Soviet hopes are undaunted\", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989</ref>\n\nIn general, the new security structure arising from superpower cooperation seemed to indicate to observers that the new world order would be based on the principles of political liberty, self-determination and non-intervention. This would mean an end to the sponsoring of military conflicts in third countries, restrictions on global arms sales, and greater engagement in the [[Middle East]] (especially regarding [[Syria]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Israel]]). The U.S. might use this opportunity to more emphatically promote [[human rights in China]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\nEconomically, debt relief was expected to be a significant issue as East\u2013West competition would give way to North\u2013South cooperation. Economic tripolarity would arise with the U.S., [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] as the three motors of world growth. Meanwhile, the Soviet social and economic crisis was manifestly going to limit its ability to project power abroad, thus necessitating continued U.S. leadership.<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\nCommentators assessing the results of the Conference and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed. Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of \"[[status quo]]-plus\" rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control \"soaring expectations\" that Gorbachev's speech unleashed.<ref name=\"list1\" />\n\n=== Gulf War and Bush's formulation ===\n[[File:Bush troops.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Bush greeting troops on the eve of the First [[Gulf War]]]]\nBush started to take the initiative from Gorbachev during the run-up to the [[Persian Gulf War]], when he began to define the elements of the new world order as he saw it and link the new order's success to the international community's response in [[Kuwait]].\n\nInitial agreement by the Soviets to allow action against [[Saddam Hussein]] highlighted this linkage in the press. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared that this superpower cooperation demonstrates that the Soviet Union has joined the international community and that in the new world order Saddam faces not just the U.S., but the international community itself.<ref name=\"wapo2\">\"Summit Decision Signals Superpower Cooperation\", ''Washington Post'', September 2, 1990</ref> A ''New York Times'' editorial was the first to assert that at stake in the collective response to Saddam was \"nothing less than the new world order which Bush and other leaders struggle to shape\".<ref name=\"nyt1\">\"The Month that Shook the World\", ''New York Times'', September 2, 1990</ref>\n\nIn ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft notes that Bush even offered to have Soviet troops amongst the coalition forces liberating Kuwait. Bush places the fate of the new world order on the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to respond to Hussein's aggression.<ref name=\"world3\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 361\u2013364.</ref> The idea that the Persian Gulf War would usher in the new world order began to take shape. Bush notes that the \"premise [was] that the United States henceforth would be obligated to lead the world community to an unprecedented degree, as demonstrated by the [[Iraq]]i crisis, and that we should attempt to pursue our [[national interest]]s, wherever possible, within a framework of concert with our friends and the [[international community]]\".<ref name=\"world4\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 399\u2013400.</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1991, President Bush addressed [[United States Congress|Congress]] in a speech often cited as the Bush administration's principal policy statement on the new world order in the Middle East following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.<ref name=\"OrenPFnF\">[[Michael Oren]], ''[[Power, Faith and Fantasy]]'', p. 569, 2011, W W Norton & Son, {{ISBN|978-0393330304}}</ref><ref name=\"auto3\"/> [[Michael Oren]] summarizes the speech, saying: \"The president proceeded to outline his plan for maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, for providing funds for Middle East development, and for instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons.  The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory-for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights\". As a first step, Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace [[Madrid Conference of 1991|conference in Madrid]].<ref name=\"OrenPFnF\"/>\n\nA pivotal point came with Bush's September 11, 1990 \"Toward a New World Order\" speech ([[wikisource:Toward a New World Order|full text]]) to a joint session of Congress. This time it was Bush, not Gorbachev, whose idealism was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]] and to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the creation of the United Nations.  Key points picked up in the press were:\n* Commitment to U.S. strength, such that it can lead the world toward rule of law, rather than use of force. The Gulf crisis was seen as a reminder that the U.S. must continue to lead and that military strength does matter, but that the resulting new world order should make military force less important in the future.\n* Soviet\u2013American partnership in cooperation toward making the world safe for democracy, making possible the goals of the United Nations for the first time since its inception. Some countered that this was unlikely and that ideological tensions would remain, such that the two superpowers could be partners of convenience for specific and limited goals only. The inability of the Soviet Union to project force abroad was another factor in skepticism toward such a partnership.\n* Another caveat raised was that the new world order was based not on U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but really on Bush-Gorbachev cooperation and that the personal diplomacy made the entire concept exceedingly fragile.\n* Future cleavages were to be economic, not ideological, with the First and Second World cooperating to contain regional instability in the [[Third World]]. Russia could become an ally against economic assaults from Asia, [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[war on drugs|drugs]] from [[Latin America]].\n* Soviet integration into world economic institutions such as the [[G7]] and establishment of ties with the European Community.\n* Restoration of German [[sovereignty]] and [[Cambodia]]'s acceptance of the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s peace plan on the day previous to the speech were seen as signs of what to expect in the new world order.\n* The reemergence of Germany and Japan as members of the great powers and concomitant reform of the United Nations Security Council was seen as necessary for great power cooperation and reinvigorated United Nations leadership\n* Europe was seen as taking the lead on building their own world order while the U.S. was relegated to the sidelines. The rationale for U.S. presence on the continent was vanishing and the Persian Gulf crisis was seen as incapable of rallying Europe. Instead, Europe was discussing the European Community, the CSCE and relations with the Soviet Union. Gorbachev even proposed an all-European security council to replace the CSCE, in effect superseding the increasingly irrelevant NATO.\n* A very few postulated a bi-polar new order of U.S. power and United Nations [[moral authority]], the first as global policeman, the second as global judge and jury. The order would be collectivist in which decisions and responsibility would be shared.\nThese were the common themes that emerged from reporting about Bush's speech and its implications.<ref name=\"list2\">Compiled from:\n* \"Evoking the memory of Wilson and 'a new world order'\", ''Boston Globe'', September 12, 1990\n* \"Superpowers to Superpartners\", ''[[Newsweek]]'', September 17, 1990\n* \"Steps to a new world order\", ''Financial Times'', September 17, 1990\n* \"U.S. leads the new world order\", ''[[Toronto Star]]'', September 19, 1990\n* \"Europe choreographs new world order, but Bush is out of step\", ''Boston Globe'', November 21\n</ref>\n\nCritics held that Bush and Baker remained too vague about what exactly the order entailed:\n{{quote|Does it mean a strengthened U.N.? And new regional security arrangements in the gulf and elsewhere? Will the U.S. be willing to put its own military under international leadership? In the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush has rejected a UN command outright. Sometimes, when Administration officials describe their goals, they say the U.S. must reduce its military burden and commitment. Other times, they appear determined to seek new arrangements to preserve U.S. military supremacy and to justify new expenditures.}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the [[American liberalism|American left]] was calling the new world order a \"rationalization for imperial ambitions\" in the Middle East while the [[Conservatism in the United States|right]] rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of United Nations revival.<ref name=\"nyt2\">\"George Bush Meet Woodrow Wilson\", ''New York Times'', November 20, 1990</ref>  [[Pat Buchanan]] predicted that the Persian Gulf War would in fact be the demise of the new world order, the concept of United Nations peacekeeping and the U.S.'s role as global policeman.<ref name=\"world5\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 426.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the speech signified more than just the rhetoric about superpower cooperation. In fact, the deeper reality of the new world order was the U.S.' emergence \"as the single greatest power in a multipolar world\". Moscow was crippled by internal problems and thus unable to project power abroad. While hampered by economic malaise, the U.S. was militarily unconstrained for the first time since the end of World War II. Militarily, it was now a unipolar world as illustrated by the Persian Gulf crisis. While diplomatic rhetoric stressed a U.S.-Soviet partnership, the U.S. was deploying troops to [[Saudi Arabia]] (a mere 700 miles from the Soviet frontier) and was preparing for war against a former Soviet [[client state]]. Further, U.S. authority over the Soviets was displayed in 1) the unification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces, and almost open appeal to Washington for aid in managing the Soviet transition to democracy; 2) withdrawal of Soviet support for Third World clients; and 3) Soviets seeking economic aid through membership in Western international economic and trade communities.<ref name=\"la\">\"With Moscow Crippled, U.S. Emerges as Top Power\", ''[[LA Times]]'', September 12, 1990</ref>\n\nThe speech was indeed pivotal but the meaning hidden. A pivotal interpretation of the speech came the same month a week later on September 18, 1990. [[Charles Krauthammer]] then delivered a lecture in Washington in which he introduced the idea of American [[unipolarity]]. By the fall 1990, his essay was published in ''Foreign Affairs'' titled \"The Unipolar Moment\".<ref>''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23-33.</ref> It had few to do with Kuwait. The main point was the following:\n{{quote|It has been assumed that the old bipolar world would beget a multipolar world\u2026 The immediate post-Cold War world is not multipolar. It is unipolar. The center of world power is an unchallenged superpower, the United States, attended by its Western allies.<ref name=\"auto1\">''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn fact, as [[Lawrence Freedman]] commented in 1991, a \"unipolar\" world is now taken seriously. He details:\n{{quote|An underlying theme in all the discussions is that the United States has now acquired a preeminent position in the international hierarchy. This situation has developed because of the precipitate decline of the Soviet Union. Bush himself has indicated that it is the new relationship with Moscow that creates the possibility for his new order. For many analysts, therefore, the new order's essential feature is not the values it is said to embody nor the principles upon which it is to be based, but that it has the United States at its center... In effect, the debate is over the consequences of the West's victory in the Cold War rather than in the Gulf for the generality of international conflicts.<ref>Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 197.</ref>}}\n\nWashington's capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the \"basis for a ''[[Pax Americana]]''\". Indeed, one of the problems with Bush's phrase was that \"a call for 'order' from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a ''Pax Americana''\".<ref>Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 196-197.</ref> The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the \"most striking feature of the post-Cold War world\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in \"The Unipolar Moment Revisited\"<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5-20.</ref> stated that the \"moment\" is lasting and lasting with \"acceleration\".<ref name=\"auto2\">''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 6.</ref> He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: \"If today's American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the \"moment\" will last forty years at best, but he adjusted the estimation in 2002: \"Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era\".<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 17.</ref> On the latter occasion, Krauthammer added perhaps his most significant comment\u2014the new unipolar world order represents a \"unique to modern history\" structure.<ref>''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5.</ref>\n\n==== Presaging the Iraq War of 2003 ====\n[[File:JamesBaker.jpeg|thumb|left|[[James Baker]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under George H. W. Bush]]\n''[[The Economist]]'' published an article explaining the drive toward the Persian Gulf War in terms presaging the run-up to the [[Iraq War of 2003]]. The author notes directly that despite the coalition, in the minds of most governments this is the U.S.' war and [[George W. Bush]] that \"chose to stake his political life on defeating Mr Hussein\". An attack on Iraq would certainly shatter Bush's alliance, they assert, predicting calls from United Nations Security Council members saying that diplomacy should have been given more time and that they will not wish to allow a course of action \"that leaves America sitting too prettily as sole remaining superpower\". When the unanimity of the Security Council ends, \"all that lovely talk about the new world order\" will too. When casualties mount, \"Bush will be called a warmonger, an [[imperialism|imperialist]] and a bully\". The article goes on to say that Bush and [[James Baker]]'s speechifying cannot save the new world order once they launch a controversial war. It closes noting that a wide consensus is not necessary for U.S. action\u2014only a hardcore of supporters, namely [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], [[Egypt]] and Britain. The rest need only not interfere.<ref name=\"econ2\">\"New World Order Inc\", ''The Economist'', November 10, 1990</ref>\n\nIn a passage with similar echoes of the future, Bush and Scowcroft explain in ''A World Transformed'' the role of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] in attempting to avert the Persian Gulf War. Secretary-General [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] arrived at [[Camp David]] to ask what he could do to head off the war. Bush told him that it was important that we get full implementation on every United Nations resolution: \"If we compromise, we weaken the UN and our own credibility in building this new world order,\" I said. \"I think Saddam Hussein doesn't believe force will be used\u2014or if it is, he can produce a stalemate\". Additional meetings between Baker or P\u00e9rez and the Iraqis are rejected for fear that they will simply come back empty-handed once again. Bush feared that Javier will be cover for Hussein's manipulations. P\u00e9rez suggested another Security Council meeting, but Bush saw no reason for one.<ref name=\"world6\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 440.</ref>\n\n=== Following the Persian Gulf War ===\nFollowing the Persian Gulf War which was seen as the crucible in which great power cooperation and collective security would emerge the new norms of the era&mdash;several academic assessments of the \"new world order\" idea were published.\n\n[[John Lewis Gaddis]], a Cold War historian, wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' about what he saw as the key characteristics of the potential new order, namely unchallenged American primacy, increasing integration, resurgent [[nationalism]] and religiosity, a diffusion of security threats and collective security. He casts the fundamental challenge as one of integration versus fragmentation and the concomitant benefits and dangers associated with each. Changes in [[telecommunication|communications]], the international economic system, the nature of security threats and the rapid spread of new ideas would prevent nations from retreating into [[isolationism|isolation]]. In light of this, Gaddis sees a chance for the [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] predicted by [[Liberal international relations theory|liberal international relations theorists]] to come closer to reality. However, he illustrates that not only is the fragmentary pressure of nationalism manifest in the former Communist bloc countries and the [[Third World]], but it is also a considerable factor in the West. Further, a revitalized [[Islam]] could play both integrating and fragmenting roles&mdash;emphasizing common identity, but also contributing to new conflicts that could resemble the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The integration coming from the new order could also aggravate [[ecology|ecological]], [[demography|demographic]] and [[epidemic]] threats. National [[self-determination]], leading to the breakup and reunification of states (such as Yugoslavia on one hand and Germany on the other) could signal abrupt shifts in the balance of power with a destabilizing effect. Integrated markets, especially energy markets, are now a security liability for the world economic system as events affecting [[energy security]] in one part of the globe could threaten countries far removed from potential conflicts. Finally, diffusion of security threats required a new security paradigm involving low-intensity, but more frequent deployment of peacekeeping troops&mdash;a type of mission that is hard to sustain under budgetary or public opinion pressure. Gaddis called for aid to Eastern European countries, updated security and economic regimes for Europe, United Nations-based regional conflict resolution, a slower pace of international economic integration and paying off the U.S. [[Government debt|debt]].<ref name=\"gaddis\">John Lewis Gaddis. \"Toward the Post\u2013Cold War World.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 1991, Spring</ref>\n\nHowever, statesman [[Strobe Talbott]] wrote of the new world order that it was only in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that the United Nations took a step toward redefining its role to take account of both interstate relations and intrastate events. Furthermore, he asserted that it was only as an unintended postscript to Desert Storm that Bush gave meaning to the \"new world order\" slogan. By the end of the year, Bush stopped talking about a new world order and his advisers explained that he had dropped the phrase because he felt it suggested more enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the planet than he actually felt. As an antidote to the uncertainties of the world, he wanted to stress the old verities of territorial integrity, national sovereignty and international stability.<ref name=\"talbott\">Strobe Talbott. \"Post-Victory Blues.\" ''Foreign Affairs.''

Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] wrote critically of the \"new world order\" and of [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s ''[[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]]'' theory in ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'':\n:The expectation of harmony was widely shared. Political and intellectual leaders elaborated similar views. The Berlin wall had come down, communist regimes had collapsed, the United Nations was to assume a new importance, the former Cold War rivals would engage in \"partnership\" and a \"grand bargain,\" peacekeeping and peacemaking would be the order of the day. The President of the world's leading country proclaimed the \"new world order\"...\n:The moment of euphoria at the end of the Cold War generated an illusion of harmony, which was soon revealed to be exactly that. The world became different in the early 1990s, but not necessarily more peaceful. Change was inevitable; progress was not... The illusion of harmony at the end of that Cold War was soon dissipated by the multiplication of ethnic conflicts and \"[[ethnic cleansing]],\" the breakdown of law and order, the emergence of new patterns of alliance and conflict among states, the resurgence of neo-[[communist]] and [[neo-fascist]] movements, intensification of religious [[fundamentalism]], the end of the \"diplomacy of smiles\" and \"[[policy of yes]]\" in Russia's relations with the West, the inability of the United Nations and the United States to suppress bloody local conflicts, and the increasing assertiveness of a rising China. In the five years after the Berlin wall came down, the word \"[[genocide]]\" was heard far more often than in any five years of the Cold War.\n:The one harmonious world paradigm is clearly far too divorced from reality to be a useful guide to the post\u2013Cold War world. Two Worlds: Us and Them. While one-world expectations appear at the end of major conflicts, the tendency to think in terms of two worlds recurs throughout human history.

The authors note that before the crisis the concept remained \"ambiguous, nascent, and unproven\" and that the U.S had not assumed a leadership role with respect to the new order.

They also note that [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] gave three priorities to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on fighting the Persian Gulf War, namely prevent further aggression, protect oil supplies and further a new world order. The authors note that the new world order did not emerge in policy speeches until after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, maintaining that the concept was clearly not critical in the U.S. decision to deploy. [[John H. Sununu]] later indicated that the administration wanted to refrain from talking about the concept until Soviet collapse was more clear.  A reversal of Soviet collapse would have been the death knell for the new order.<ref name=\"psq\"/>\n\nBush and Scowcroft were frustrated by the exaggerated and distorted ideas surrounding the new world order. They did not intend to suggest that the U.S. would yield significant influence to the United Nations, or that they expected the world to enter an era of peace and tranquility. They preferred [[multilateralism]], but did not reject [[unilateralism]]. The new world order did not signal peace, but a \"challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay\".<ref name=\"psq\"/>\n\nBush's drive toward the Persian Gulf War was based on the world making a clear choice. Baker recalls that UNSCR 660's \"language was simply and crystal clear, purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression\". Bush's motivation centered around 1) the dangers of [[appeasement]]; and 2) failure to check aggression could spark further aggression. Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection and became very emotional over [[List of war crimes#Invasion of Kuwait .28Iraq.29|Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait]]. He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability. While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats. Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\n[[File:Eduard shevardnadze.jpg|thumb|[[Eduard Shevardnadze]], then [[Soviet Foreign Minister]]]]\nThe Gulf War was also framed as a test case for United Nations credibility.  As a model for dealing with aggressors, Scowcroft believed that the United States ought to act in a way that others can trust and thus get United Nations support. It was critical that the U.S. not look like it was throwing its weight around. Great power cooperation and United Nations support would collapse if the U.S. marched on the [[Baghdad]] to try to remake Iraq. However, practically, superpower cooperation was limited. For example, when the U.S. deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] became furious at not being consulted.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\nBy 1992, the authors note that the U.S. was already abandoning the idea of collective action. The leaked draft of the [[Paul Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]]-[[Lewis Libby|Libby]] 1992 Defense Guidance Report effectively confirmed this shift as it called for a unilateral role for the U.S. in world affairs, focusing on preserving American dominance.<ref name=\"psq\" />\n\nIn closing ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft sums up what his expectations were for the new world order. He states that the U.S. has the strength and the resources to pursue its own interests, but has a disproportionate responsibility to use its power in pursuit of the common good as well as an obligation to lead and to be involved.  The U.S. is perceived as uncomfortable in exercising its power and ought to work to create predictability and stability in international relations. The U.S. needs not be embroiled in every conflict, but ought to aid in developing multilateral responses to them. The U.S. can unilaterally broker disputes, but ought to act whenever possible in concert with equally committed partners to deter major aggression.<ref name=\"world7\">''A World Transformed'', pp. 565\u2013566.</ref>\n\n== Recent political usage ==\n[[Henry Kissinger]] stated in 1994: \"The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component.

He then went on: \"To succeed now, the post-war rules of the game and the post-war international institutions \u2013 fit for the Cold War and a world of just 50 states \u2013 must be radically reformed to fit our world of globalisation\".<ref name=\"afp\">{{cite news |title=Britain, India push for UN Security Council reform |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iQVSQB8calOpCj31LxqQ29dxK1gw |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=January 21, 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> He also called for the revamping of [[Bretton Woods system|post-war global institutions]] including the [[World Bank]], [[G8]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].
