One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

Though Central Hudson admitted that it normally had a legal duty to remove its abandoned power lines, it refused to remove its abandoned bridge-affixed lines, instead relying on a claim that it no longer owned the lines at issue pursuant to prior litigation with Conrail that was decided on September 26, 1984,<ref>Consolidated Rail Corporation v.

Walkway opened the bridge to the public on October 3, 2009, in time for the quadricentennial celebration of [[Henry Hudson]] sailing up the [[Hudson River]], and that day handed it over to the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] for management. Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

The proposal seemed so absurd that the ''Eagle'' ridiculed it, and it was effectively forgotten for a few years.<ref name=mabee>{{cite book|last=Mabee|first=Carleton|title=Bridging The Hudson: The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge and Its Connecting Railroad Lines|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|year=2001|isbn=1-930098-24-3 }}</ref><ref name=WalkwayHist>{{cite web |url=https://walkway.org/history |title=History |publisher=Walkway Over the Hudson |accessdate=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401162715/https://walkway.org/history |archive-date=April 1, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many plans had been made for a [[fixed span]] across the [[Hudson River]] south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to replace numerous [[car float]] and ferry operations. One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

Walkway opened the bridge to the public on October 3, 2009, in time for the quadricentennial celebration of [[Henry Hudson]] sailing up the [[Hudson River]], and that day handed it over to the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] for management. Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty. This forces Russ to turn informant against Ruth, who Roy intends to turn informant on Marty. Instead, Russ and his brother Boyd plan to rob and kill Marty to finance a life on the run.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah. Charlotte and Jonah discuss using what is left of their money took to buy a van and run away. Helen tells the Snells to burn their poppies so Roy will not find any evidence, but Darlene resists.

Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Helen tells Navarro Wendy and Marty are liabilities and Navarro tells her to do what she thinks best. Darlene persuades Nix to get Ben released in exchange for Nix's deputies not being included in Darlene's drug business. Ben goes to Helen's house, where he confronts Helen and Erin about Helen's illegal activities.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Fire Pink\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Miki Johnson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a taxi following his confrontation with Helen and Erin, Ben engages in an extended, incoherent monologue. Marty goes to Ruth's and asks why she worked for Ben's release. Ben arrives and admits he went to Helen's house. Ruth hides Ben at Darlene's. Erin confronts Charlotte and Jonah about Ben's claims and they admit Ben is right. Erin tells Helen she knows the truth about Helen's work and returns to Chicago. Recognizing they are vulnerable because Ben went to Helen's, Marty and Wendy plot to show Navarro they are more valuable to him than she is. Ben leaves Darlene's so he can pledge his love to Ruth. Nelson follows him into the casino, so Marty takes Ben out a side exit. Nelson follows Ruth home and Ruth challenges him about Cade's murder. Marty engineers a sudden increase in casino profits, meaning Maya will remain and continue auditing the Byrdes. Ben flees with Wendy, then calls police on himself, but Wendy talks officers out of arresting him. Ben calls Helen to apologize, and Wendy ends the call before Helen learns Ben's location. Wendy abandons Ben at a restaurant, then breaks down during a call to Marty. Ben sees Nelson arrive.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = All In\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Chris Mundy\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = Nelson, Marty and Ruth cremate Ben's body at the funeral home.

Ruth and Wendy argue about blame for Ben's and Cade's deaths. Ruth quits working for Marty. Wendy admits she made the call revealing Ben's location. Marty consoles her by agreeing with her plan to make Navarro see their value. Wendy and Marty realize the way to win Navarro over is to end the cartel war. Marty provides still photos from Jonah's drone video of the attack on Cosgrove's truck to Maya, resulting in arrests of Lagunas members. Darlene avenges Ruth by shooting and wounding Frank Jr., then brings Frank Sr. into her business as a peace offering. Jonah confronts Helen at gunpoint about Ben's death, but Helen talks him out of shooting. Maya tells Marty Trevor gave Helen a copy of the confession Marty made to Maya. Navarro requires Wendy, Marty and Helen to attend his son's second baptism. Upon arrival, Nelson kills Helen and Navarro tells Marty and Wendy that this is the beginning of increased cooperation between the three of them.\n|LineColor  = 01405F\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#00AAC0;\"|\n| 1\n| 70% (69 reviews)\n| 66 (29 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#066069;\"|\n| 2\n| 76% (45 reviews)\n| 59 (14 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#01405F;\"|\n| 3\n| 97% (30 reviews)\n| 77 (11 reviews)\n|}\n\n====Season 1====\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season had an approval rating of 70% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 6.84/10.

The word ''slug'' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly [[Opisthobranchia|sea slug]]s and [[semislug]]s (this is in contrast to the common name ''[[snail]]'', which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\n\nVarious [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] families of land slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, the various families of slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category \"slug\" is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] one.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOf the six orders of [[Pulmonata]], two \u2013 the [[Onchidiacea]] and [[Soleolifera]] \u2013 solely comprise slugs. A third family, the [[Sigmurethra]], contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs.<ref name=Burton1982 /> The taxonomy of this group is in the process of being revised in light of DNA sequencing.<ref name=White2011>{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = T.

The upper pair is [[light]] [[sensor|sensing]] and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Both pairs are retractable.\n\n'''Mantle'''\nOn top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped ''[[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a [[respiratory]] opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the [[pneumostome]].\n\n'''Tail{{anchor|Keel}}'''\nThe part of a slug behind the mantle is called the 'tail'.\n\n'''Keel'''\nSome species of slugs, for example ''[[Tandonia budapestensis]]'', have a prominent ridge running over their back along the middle of the tail (sometimes along the whole tail, sometimes only the final part). This ridge is called a 'keel'.\n\n'''Foot'''\nThe bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of [[muscular contraction]] on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of [[mucus]] that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues.<ref name=biologists1>{{cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|author2=Gosline, J.

In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under [[tree bark]], fallen [[Trunk (botany)|logs]], rocks and man-made structures, such as [[Flowerpot|planters]], to help retain body moisture.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Like all other gastropods, they undergo [[torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] (a 180\u00b0 twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation\u2014but externally, the bodies of slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the [[pneumostome]], which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side.\n\nSlugs produce two types of [[mucus]]: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The \"slime trail\" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful.<ref name=illinois1>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=P|title=Slugs|url=http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/pastpest/199809g.html|website=Home, Yard & Garden Pest Newsletter|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> Some species of slug, such as ''[[Limax maximus]]'', secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Slug eggs and baby.jpg|thumb|''[[Deroceras]]'' juvenile with eggs of another (larger) slug species, most likely Arionidae]]\n[[File:Slugs Mating.jpg|thumb|left|Slugs, suspended by [[mucous]] thread and pad on wall.]] Slugs are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both female and male reproductive organs.<ref name=\"theoystersgarter1\">{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |title=Perverted cannibalistic hermaphrodites haunt the Pacific Northwest! \" The Oyster's Garter |publisher=Theoystersgarter.com |date=24 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413003808/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |archivedate=13 April 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia.

In the banana slugs, the penis sometimes becomes trapped inside the body of the partner.

The environmentally safer iron phosphate has been shown to be at least as effective as baits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/node/995 |title=Less toxic iron phosphate slug bait proves effective |publisher=Extension.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=2 March 2014|date= 25 February 2008}}</ref> Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'') are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens.

The word ''slug'' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly [[Opisthobranchia|sea slug]]s and [[semislug]]s (this is in contrast to the common name ''[[snail]]'', which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\n\nVarious [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] families of land slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, the various families of slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category \"slug\" is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] one.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOf the six orders of [[Pulmonata]], two \u2013 the [[Onchidiacea]] and [[Soleolifera]] \u2013 solely comprise slugs. A third family, the [[Sigmurethra]], contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs.<ref name=Burton1982 /> The taxonomy of this group is in the process of being revised in light of DNA sequencing.<ref name=White2011>{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = T.

The upper pair is [[light]] [[sensor|sensing]] and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Both pairs are retractable.\n\n'''Mantle'''\nOn top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped ''[[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a [[respiratory]] opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the [[pneumostome]].\n\n'''Tail{{anchor|Keel}}'''\nThe part of a slug behind the mantle is called the 'tail'.\n\n'''Keel'''\nSome species of slugs, for example ''[[Tandonia budapestensis]]'', have a prominent ridge running over their back along the middle of the tail (sometimes along the whole tail, sometimes only the final part). This ridge is called a 'keel'.\n\n'''Foot'''\nThe bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of [[muscular contraction]] on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of [[mucus]] that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues.<ref name=biologists1>{{cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|author2=Gosline, J.

They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under [[tree bark]], fallen [[Trunk (botany)|logs]], rocks and man-made structures, such as [[Flowerpot|planters]], to help retain body moisture.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Like all other gastropods, they undergo [[torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] (a 180\u00b0 twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation\u2014but externally, the bodies of slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the [[pneumostome]], which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side.\n\nSlugs produce two types of [[mucus]]: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The \"slime trail\" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs.<ref name=\"biologists1\"/> Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful.<ref name=illinois1>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=P|title=Slugs|url=http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/pastpest/199809g.html|website=Home, Yard & Garden Pest Newsletter|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> Some species of slug, such as ''[[Limax maximus]]'', secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Slug eggs and baby.jpg|thumb|''[[Deroceras]]'' juvenile with eggs of another (larger) slug species, most likely Arionidae]]\n[[File:Slugs Mating.jpg|thumb|left|Slugs, suspended by [[mucous]] thread and pad on wall.]] Slugs are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both female and male reproductive organs.<ref name=\"theoystersgarter1\">{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |title=Perverted cannibalistic hermaphrodites haunt the Pacific Northwest! \" The Oyster's Garter |publisher=Theoystersgarter.com |date=24 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413003808/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |archivedate=13 April 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia.

The document further reveals that \"Ethiopia is one of the most malaria-prone countries in Africa, with rates of morbidity and mortality increasing dramatically (i.e. 3.5-fold) during epidemics\". The same document alleges serious policy failures of the Government of Tedros who was the Minister of Health until 2013. It argues \"Ethiopia faces many challenges related to human resources for healthcare, including the shortage of skilled health workers, high turnover and lack of retention of health professionals\". In addition to these challenges, the National Malaria Guideline stresses once again, \"serious problems in coordinating health interventions and implementing partners\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==== AIDS ====\nUnder Tedros, the Ministry of Health was able to turn around Ethiopia's record of the highest number of new HIV infections in Africa, bringing the number down dramatically.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The prevalence was reduced from its double digit record to 4.2 in cities and 0.6 in rural areas.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) said the rate of HIV infection in Ethiopia has declined by 90% between 2002 and 2012, while the rate AIDS-related death has dropped by 53%.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The number of people starting HIV treatment increased more than 150-fold during 2005\u20132008.<ref name=\"Yale\" />\n\nThe decline in the infection rate has been attributed to the concerted effort of the Ministry of Health in providing medicines and organizing various awareness-raising programs.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The office has managed to integrate the people in HIV prevention and control activities.
