It initially developed on the hill to the north of the river.

A river walk runs through the town from east to west. Just outside the town is Broaks Wood, a popular area for walking owned by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Halstead Public Gardens were established in 1900 and are noted for their floral displays. The Antiques Centre is full of interesting pieces, ranging from clothing to household items.\n\n==Mills==\nTownsford Mill spans the river at the bottom of the town houses. In 1818, [[Samuel Courtauld (industrialist)|Samuel Courtauld]] built two mills, Townsford at Halstead and another at [[Bocking, Essex|Bocking]]. At the end of 1824, Halstead Mill was sold to Stephen Beuzeville. In 1825, Samuel installed a [[steam engine]] at Bocking Mill. An agreement dated 19 January 1825 was drawn up between Beuzeville and Samuel Courtauld and partners for the conversion of Halstead Mill for silk throwing. Beuzeville was to provide the expertise, capital, and supply the silk; Courtauld was to erect the [[power loom]]s and operate the mill in return for a share in the profits; Beuzeville was to take delivery of the yarn and manufacture the [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|cr\u00eape]], on which he was a technical expert with 20 years' experience. The mill appears to have been in operation by the summer of 1825, with Joseph Ash as manager.\n\nThe introduction of new technology was important but the mills still remained heavily dependent on manpower, or more accurately, woman-power. The looms required supervision by an army of young female workers and even in 1838, more than 92 per cent of the workforce was female.\n\nIn 1827 Stephen Beuzeville was declared bankrupt; a formal deed of sale dated 11 April 1828 was created between the commissioners in bankruptcy and Samuel Courtauld, whereby Halstead Mill (subject to charges of \u00a3300) was sold to Courtaulds for a cash payment of \u00a31,500.

The USSR and later Russia have transported 49 citizens of 18 other nations on the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicle, usually as part of a commercial arrangement, including seven [[space tourist]]s flying through the [[Space Adventures]] contract.

(or 'BaBemba' using the Ba- prefix to mean 'people of', and also called 'Awemba' or 'BaWemba' in the past) belong to a large group of peoples mainly in the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern]], [[Luapula Province|Luapula]] and [[Copperbelt]] Provinces of [[Zambia]] who trace their origins to the Luba and Lunda states of the upper [[Congo basin]], in what became [[Katanga Province]] in southern [[Congo-Kinshasa]] (DRC). There are over 30 Bemba clans, named after animals or natural organisms, such as the royal clan, \"the people of the crocodile\" (Bena Ng'andu) or the Bena Bowa (Mushroom Clan). The [[Bemba language]] (Chibemba) is related to the [[Bantu languages]] Kaonde (in Zambia and the DRC), Luba (in the DRC), Nsenga and Tonga (in Zambia), and Nyanja/[[Chewa language|Chewa]] (in Zambia and Malawi). It is mainly spoken in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces, and has become the most widely spoken African language in the country, although not always as a first language. Bemba numbered 250,000 in 1963 but a much larger population includes some 'eighteen different ethnic groups' who, together with the Bemba, form a closely related ethno-linguistic cluster of matrilineal-matrifocal agriculturalists known as the Bemba-speaking peoples of Zambia.

Luo [[Benga music]] derives from the traditional music of the ''[[nyatiti]]'' lyre:<ref name=\"Manuel, Popular Musics, pg. 101\">Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 101</ref> the Luo-speaking [[Acholi people|Acholi]] of northern Uganda use the [[adungu]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Turino, pp. 179, 182; Sandahl, Sten, \"Exiles and Traditions\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 698\u2013701</ref> Rhythms are characterized by syncopation and acrusis. Melodies are lyrical, with vocal ornamentations, especially when the music carries an important message. Songs are call-and-response or solo performances such as chants, recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases which carried serious messages. Luo dances such as the ''dudu'' were introduced by them. A unique characteristic is the introduction of another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance in self-praise. This is called ''pakruok''. A unique kind of ululation, ''sigalagala'', mainly done by women, marks the climax of the musical performance. Dance styles are elegant and graceful, involving the movement of one leg in the opposite direction to the waist or vigorous shaking of the shoulders, usually to the ''nyatiti''. Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances the Luo wore costumes; sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist and red or white clay used by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist. Ligisa headgear, shield and spear, reed hats and clubs were made from locally available materials. Luo musical instruments range from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, Abu-!, to a specific type of trumpet. In the benga style of music. the guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. Benga is played by musicians of many tribes and is no longer considered a purely Luo style.\n* The [[Maasai people#Music and dance|Music and dance of the Maasai people]] used no instruments in the past because as semi-nomadic Nilotic pastoralists instruments were considered too cumbersome to move. Traditional Maasai music is strictly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[vocal music]], a group chanting polyphonic rhythms while soloists take turns singing verses. The [[call and response (music)|call and response]] that follows each verse is called ''namba''. Performances are often competitive and divided by age and gender. The neighbouring [[Turkana people]] have maintained their ancient traditions, including call and response music, which is almost entirely vocal. A horn made from the [[kudu]] antelope is also played. The [[Samburu people|Samburu]] are related to the Maasai, and like them, play almost no instruments except simple pipes and a kind of guitar.  There are also erotic songs sung by women praying for rain.\n* The [[Borana people|Borana]] live near the [[Ethiopia]]n border, and their music reflects [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Somali music|Somali]] and other traditions.

Melodies are lyrical, with vocal ornamentations, especially when the music carries an important message. Songs are call-and-response or solo performances such as chants, recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases which carried serious messages. Luo dances such as the ''dudu'' were introduced by them. A unique characteristic is the introduction of another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance in self-praise. This is called ''pakruok''. A unique kind of ululation, ''sigalagala'', mainly done by women, marks the climax of the musical performance. Dance styles are elegant and graceful, involving the movement of one leg in the opposite direction to the waist or vigorous shaking of the shoulders, usually to the ''nyatiti''. Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances the Luo wore costumes; sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist and red or white clay used by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist. Ligisa headgear, shield and spear, reed hats and clubs were made from locally available materials. Luo musical instruments range from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, Abu-!, to a specific type of trumpet. In the benga style of music. the guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. Benga is played by musicians of many tribes and is no longer considered a purely Luo style.\n* The [[Maasai people#Music and dance|Music and dance of the Maasai people]] used no instruments in the past because as semi-nomadic Nilotic pastoralists instruments were considered too cumbersome to move. Traditional Maasai music is strictly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[vocal music]], a group chanting polyphonic rhythms while soloists take turns singing verses. The [[call and response (music)|call and response]] that follows each verse is called ''namba''. Performances are often competitive and divided by age and gender. The neighbouring [[Turkana people]] have maintained their ancient traditions, including call and response music, which is almost entirely vocal. A horn made from the [[kudu]] antelope is also played. The [[Samburu people|Samburu]] are related to the Maasai, and like them, play almost no instruments except simple pipes and a kind of guitar.  There are also erotic songs sung by women praying for rain.\n* The [[Borana people|Borana]] live near the [[Ethiopia]]n border, and their music reflects [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Somali music|Somali]] and other traditions. They are known also for using the [[chamonge guitar]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Paterson, Doug, \"The Life and Times of Kenyan Pop\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 509\u2013522</ref>  which is made from a cooking pot strung with metal wires.\n\n===Bantu traditions===\n[[File:Banziris, Joueurs de ballonphon - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie (1907).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ngbaka languages|Ngbaka-speaking]] Gbanzili men of the rainforest play xylophones with [[calabash]] [[resonator]]s, 1907.]]\nDrums (''[[ngoma drums|ngoma]]'', ''ng'oma'' or ''ingoma'') are much used: particularly large ones have been developed among the court musicians of East African kings.
