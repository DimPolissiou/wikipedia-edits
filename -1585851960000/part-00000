She was the first woman to host the Oscars ceremony.  Her transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn.

In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays. She received an honorary doctorate in literature from Muskingum in 1947,<ref>{{cite news |editor-last=Rathbun |editor-first=Joe |title=Muskingum to Honor Actress |date=31 May 1947 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/293009118/ |newspaper=The Time Recorder |publisher=W.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

McFarland, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7864-2367-6}}</ref> In \"[[The Invaders (The Twilight Zone)|The Invaders]]\" (broadcast January 27, 1961) Moorehead played a woman whose isolated farm is plagued by mysterious intruders. In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.

1974) was an American actress whose 41-year career included work in radio, stage, film, and television.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', May 8, 1974, page 286.</ref> She is best known for her role as [[List of Bewitched characters#Endora|Endora]] on the television series ''[[Bewitched]]'', but she also had notable roles in films, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'', ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', and ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.\n\nMoorehead rarely played lead roles, but her skill at character development and range earned her one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s in addition to nominations for four [[Academy Awards]] and six Emmy Awards. She was the first woman to host the Oscars ceremony.  Her transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn. ''Agnes Moorehead: a Bio-Bibliography''. Greenwood Press, 1992. {{ISBN|9780313281556}}.</ref> Moorehead rarely spoke of her sister after her suicide at age 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8246713/margaret-ann-moorehead|title=Margaret Ann Moorehead Death Certificate|date=1929-07-16|website=Find a Grave|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAs a young lady, Moorehead joined the chorus of the [[The Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Company]], known as \"The Muny\". In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.

The term was first discovered in 1791 by Mondini when he was completing a temporal bone dissection. It was then defined by Valvassori and Clemis as a vestibular aqueduct that is greater than or equal to 2.0 mm at the operculum and/or greater than or equal to 1.0 mm at the midpoint. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Christina |title=Vestibular Pathology in Children with enlarged vestibular aqueduct |journal=The Laryngoscope |date=2016 |volume=126 |issue=10 |page=2344-2350 |doi=10.1002/lary.25890}}</ref>Some use the term '''enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome''' but this is felt by others to be erroneous as it is a clinical finding which can occur in several syndromes.\n\n==Symptoms==\nAlthough large vestibular aqueducts are a [[congenital disorder|congenital condition]], hearing loss may not be present from birth. Age of diagnosis ranges from infancy to adulthood, and symptoms include fluctuating and sometimes progressive [[sensorineural hearing loss]] and [[Disequilibrium (medicine)|disequilibrium]]. It is possible that a small portion of those with large vestibular aqueducts will not exhibit auditory symptoms such as hearing loss. While this is uncommon, hearing loss can progress later in life especially after head trauma.<ref>{{citation |title=Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome in the Pediatric Population |author1=Madden, Colm |author2=Halsted, Mark |author3=Benton, Corning |author4=Greinwald, John |author5=Choo, Daniel |date=July 2003 |journal=Otology & Neurotology|volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=625\u2013632 |doi=10.1097/00129492-200307000-00016|pmid=12851556 }}</ref> Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and can be sensorineural, conductive, or mixed.

(Aquaeductus vestibuli labeled at bottom right]]\n\nThe vestibular aqueduct acts as a canal between the inner ear and the cranial cavity. Running through it is a tube called the [[endolymphatic duct]], which normally carries a fluid called [[endolymph]] from the inner ear to the endolymphatic sac in the cranial cavity.  When the endolymphatic duct and sac are larger than normal, as is the case in large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, endolymph is allowed to travel back from the [[endolymphatic sac]] into the inner ear.  This often results fluctuations in hearing levels.  Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are caused by mutations in gene SLC26A4, which is also associated with Pendred's syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts often occur with other inner ear development problems, such as [[cochlea]]r deformities. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are part of the classic  Mondini deformity. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs occur in [[Pendred syndrome]] which is caused by a defect on chromosome 7q31.<ref name=PdsMutation />. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts can also occur in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, CHARGE syndrome and [[renal tubular acidosis]].\n\nEnlarged vestibular aqueducts can be bilateral or unilateral.\n\nHearing loss caused by large vestibular aqueduct syndrome is not inevitable, although people with the syndrome are at a much higher risk of developing hearing loss than the general population.

The term was first discovered in 1791 by Mondini when he was completing a temporal bone dissection.

Age of diagnosis ranges from infancy to adulthood, and symptoms include fluctuating and sometimes progressive [[sensorineural hearing loss]] and [[Disequilibrium (medicine)|disequilibrium]]. It is possible that a small portion of those with large vestibular aqueducts will not exhibit auditory symptoms such as hearing loss.

(Aquaeductus vestibuli labeled at bottom right]]\n\nThe vestibular aqueduct acts as a canal between the inner ear and the cranial cavity. Running through it is a tube called the [[endolymphatic duct]], which normally carries a fluid called [[endolymph]] from the inner ear to the endolymphatic sac in the cranial cavity.  When the endolymphatic duct and sac are larger than normal, as is the case in large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, endolymph is allowed to travel back from the [[endolymphatic sac]] into the inner ear.  This often results fluctuations in hearing levels.  Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are caused by mutations in gene SLC26A4, which is also associated with Pendred's syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts often occur with other inner ear development problems, such as [[cochlea]]r deformities. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are part of the classic  Mondini deformity. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs occur in [[Pendred syndrome]] which is caused by a defect on chromosome 7q31.<ref name=PdsMutation />. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts can also occur in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, CHARGE syndrome and [[renal tubular acidosis]].\n\nEnlarged vestibular aqueducts can be bilateral or unilateral.\n\nHearing loss caused by large vestibular aqueduct syndrome is not inevitable, although people with the syndrome are at a much higher risk of developing hearing loss than the general population.   Hearing loss is very likely.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nEnlarged vestibular aqueducts are commonly picked up after newborn hearing screen when a child is identified as having a hearing loss. The hearing loss is commonly mixed and can be of any degree when first identified. The conductive component is due to a third window effect caused by the widened vestibular aqueduct. \nDuring an audiologic assessment, an air-bone gap in the low frequencies can occur due to the enlarged vestibular aqueduct acting as a third mobile window.

He served seven months in federal prison.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-jeb-stuart-magruder-20140517-story.html</ref>\n\nMagruder later attended [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He spoke publicly about ethics and his role in the Watergate scandal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he gave interviews in which he changed his accounts of actions by various participants in the Watergate coverup, including claiming that [[President Richard Nixon]] ordered the break-ins.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/jeb-magruder-79-nixon-aide-jailed-for-watergate-dies.html</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-bz6154fh47 1973 Watergate Hearings; 1973-06-14; Part 1 of 6], 1:04:59, [[Library of Congress]], [[American Archive of Public Broadcasting]] (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC<ref name=\"AAPB\">{{cite web | title =1973 Watergate Hearings; 1973-06-14; Part 1 of 6 | work = | publisher =[[Library of Congress]], [[American Archive of Public Broadcasting]] (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC | date = June 13, 1973| url =http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-bz6154fh47 | accessdate =January 20, 2018 }}\n [https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/exhibits/Watergate_Episode_Guide.pdf Episode Guide]</ref> }}\n\nJeb Stuart Magruder was born and grew up on [[Staten Island, New York]]. His father, a Civil War buff, named him for Confederate general [[J.E.B. Stuart]].<ref>Martin, Douglas \"Jeb Magruder, 79, Nixon Aide Jailed for Watergate, Dies\" https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/jeb-magruder-79-nixon-aide-jailed-for-watergate-dies.html</ref> He was an honor student at [[Curtis High School]]. Magruder was an excellent junior tennis player and swimmer, among the best in the greater New York area.<ref>Magruder, p. 17</ref> He earned a Bachelor of Arts in [[political science]] in 1958 from [[Williams College]], where he competed on the [[varsity team|varsity]] swimming team and set several regional records.<ref>Magruder, pp. 18-29</ref> During an intermission from college, he served in the [[U.S. Army]] for 21 months, and was stationed in [[South Korea]].<ref>Magruder, pp. 21\u201324</ref> He earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>Magruder, p. 36</ref>\n\nMagruder worked for [[IBM]] after college. He moved to San Francisco to take a position with the Crown Zellerbach firm, where he worked in its sales and marketing department. Later he started his own consumer products company.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHe married Gail Barnes Nicholas on October 17, 1959, in [[Brentwood, California]].<ref>Magruder, pp. 29\u201333</ref> The couple had four children. They were divorced in 1984.\n\nMagruder married Patricia Newton on February 28, 1987, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. They were divorced in May 2003.\n\n==Business career and politics==\nIn the late 1950s, Magruder moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] with Jewel Tea, in a transfer for work. He became involved there as a campaign manager for the Republican Party during the 1960 election campaign, working as chairman of an urban ward.<ref>Magruder, p. 35</ref>\n\nMagruder moved to Chicago for his [[MBA]] studies. Afterward he shifted from IBM to the consulting firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. In Chicago he remained involved with the Republican Party. His first major political job was managing the successful 1962 [[primary election|primary]] campaign of [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for the Republican nomination to the [[United States House of Representatives]], preparing for the election in [[Illinois' 13th congressional district]]. Rumsfeld won the primary and the seat in Congress, in a major upset in a ward traditionally dominated by Democrats and unions.  The win catapulted Magruder into the early ranks of young political technocrats who used data and analytics to engineer campaigns, and it caught the attention of the Republican party machine.<ref>Magruder, pp. 37\u201339</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Magruder moved from Booz Allen Hamilton to [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]], a regional grocery firm. During his nearly four years with them, he was promoted to merchandise manager.<ref>Magruder, pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nMagruder became involved with the Illinois organization of the [[Barry Goldwater]] presidential campaign in late 1963, but became disillusioned with Goldwater's political views.<ref>Magruder, pp. 43\u201345</ref> He worked briefly as campaign manager for [[Richard Ogilvie]]'s 1966 campaign for president of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Board of Supervisors. The political workload, combined with work pressures, caused Magruder to end employment with Jewel.\n\nHe relocated to California in mid-1966, to begin a higher level job with the [[Broadway Stores]] company.<ref>Magruder, pp. 46\u201351</ref> Magruder's next political involvement started in mid-1967, when he served as Southern California coordinator for the [[Richard Nixon]] presidential campaign. He left early in 1968 due to internal organizational problems.<ref>Magruder, 51\u201354</ref>\n\nMagruder entered partnership during early 1969 with two other entrepreneurs to start two new businesses, and became president and chief executive officer of these firms.<ref>Magruder, pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n\n==Joins White House staff==\nMagruder, while working in Los Angeles as a business executive, was approached through Republican acquaintances and asked to interview to join the White House staff. He was appointed to the [[White House]] staff in 1969 at age 34, as special assistant to the president. Like some other private sector executives, he took a pay cut to join public service. He moved with his family to Washington, D.C.<ref>Magruder, pp. 9-10</ref> He worked for Nixon operatives [[H.R. Haldeman]] and [[Herbert G. Klein]], communications director for the Executive Branch. Magruder's formal title was deputy director of White House Communications. \n \n===Committee to Re-elect the President===\n{{Watergate|CRP}}\nMagruder served in the White House until the spring of 1971, when he left to manage the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP, also known as CREEP), first as director. By early 1972 in the election year, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] took over as director of CREEP and Magruder acted as his deputy. As Mitchell became preoccupied with a scandal involving the [[ITT Corporation]] and by his efforts to restrain his outspoken wife [[Martha Mitchell|Martha]], Magruder took on more of the management of the CREEP.<ref>[[H.R. Haldeman]], ''The Ends of Power'', New York: New York Times Books, 1978, p.9</ref>\n\nThe campaign to re-elect the President was extraordinarily [[1972 U.S. presidential election|successful]], winning 49 of 50 states; Nixon lost only [[Massachusetts]] and the [[District of Columbia]] to Democrat [[George McGovern]]. The final tally of Nixon's victory was 520 to 17 electoral votes, the second largest [[Electoral College (United States)]] margin in history up until then, after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1936 victory over [[Alf Landon]], (523 to 8).\n\n===Manages 1973 Inaugural===\nMagruder worked as inaugural director from October 1972 to arrange [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[United States presidential inauguration]] ceremony and celebration in January 1973.<ref>Magruder, pp. 298\u2013303</ref> In March 1973, he began a job as director of policy planning with the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. He resigned soon afterward, as the Watergate scandal began to heat up and become scrutinized again by media following [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]]'s disclosures of [[perjury]] during the original Watergate trial of the five burglars; the former Watergate burglar wrote about this to the ''[[Washington Star]].'' <ref>Magruder, pp. 310\u2013318</ref>\n\n==Watergate scandal==\nMagruder, in his role with CREEP, was involved with the Watergate matters from an early stage, including its planning, execution, and cover-up.\n\n===Liddy plan===\nMagruder met with White House Counsel [[John Dean]] and [[John N. Mitchell]] (Attorney General of the United States and director of CREEP) on January 27 and February 4, 1972, to review preliminary plans by [[G. Gordon Liddy]] (Counsel to CREEP) for intelligence gathering ideas for the 1972 campaign. The Watergate burglaries would evolve from those meetings. From the day they met in December 1971, Magruder and Liddy (who had been hired by Mitchell and Dean) had a conflicted personal relationship.<ref>Magruder, pp. 185\u2013197</ref>\n\n===Cooperates with prosecutors===\nDuring April 1973, Magruder began cooperating with federal [[prosecutor]]s. In exchange, Magruder was allowed to plead guilty in August 1973 to a one-count indictment of [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to obstruct justice, to defraud the United States, and to illegally eavesdrop on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s national headquarters at the [[Watergate Hotel]]. On May 21, 1974, Magruder was sentenced by Judge [[John Sirica]] to ten months to four years for his role in the failed burglary of Watergate and the following cover-up. After his sentencing, Magruder said, \"I am confident that this country will survive its Watergates and its Jeb Magruders.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the end, he served seven months of his sentence (in a Federal prison in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]]).\n\n[[File:Jeb Magruder, photo portrait, Nixon administration, black and white.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Jeb Stuart Magruder as a member of the Nixon Administration.]]\nMagruder originally testified that he knew nothing to indicate that President Nixon had any prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary.\n\nIn his book, ''An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate'' (1974), he wrote, \n<blockquote>I know nothing to indicate that Nixon was aware in advance of the plan to break into the Democratic headquarters. It is possible that Mitchell or Haldeman told him in advance, but I think it's likelier that they would not have mentioned it unless the operation had produced some results of interest to him.</blockquote>{{page needed|date=September 2015}} This book was published before Magruder's sentencing on May 21, and before Nixon resigned as the president.\n\nMagruder had testified that he thought that he was helping establish a legal [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence-gathering]] operation. In his book Magruder wrote about former attorney general John Mitchell and [[Fred LaRue]] meeting in late March 1972 in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]]. He wrote that Mitchell approved the plan to eavesdrop on the Watergate complex soon after this meeting.<ref>Magruder, pp. 210\u2013215</ref>\n\n==After Watergate==\nAfter his prison term, Magruder began a speaking tour on college campuses and in other public spaces, inspiring some critics to suggest he had profited from the scandal and his decision to turn state's evidence.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/28/archives/jeb-magruder-superstar.html</ref> He published a Christian-oriented memoir, ''From Power to Peace'' in 1976. He earned a [[Master of Divinity]] degree from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1981 and became ordained as a [[Presbyterian]] minister. He served as associate minister at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Burlingame, California]] and First Community Church of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. (While there, Magruder chaired that city's Commission on Ethics and Values for a time.) In May 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] denied a request from Magruder for a presidential [[pardon]].<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/jeb.html</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Magruder was called as senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In 1995, [[Kentucky]] Governor [[Brereton Jones]] reinstated Magruder's right to campaign for public office in the state.\n\n===Continued controversy===\nIn 1990 Magruder consented to interviews with authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin while the two were conducting research for their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' (St. Martin's Press). Magruder admitted that he had lied to prosecutors, to the Senate's Watergate Committee, and in his 1974 book ''An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate'', concerning aspects of the early cover-up.\n\nTo Colodny and Gettlin, he said that he had called [[John Dean]] several hours after the (second) Watergate break-in was discovered, and that Dean set in motion several cover-up strategies. This version of events tallied closely with that of [[Gordon Liddy]], as set out in his 1980 book ''Will''. Books published earlier by others, however, such as Magruder's in 1974 and Dean's ''Blind Ambition'' (1976), had become the accepted 'truth' of the cover-up. These versions had very profound and damaging effects on the reputations of senior figures such as [[H.R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]], and [[John N. Mitchell]].<ref name=\"colodny\"/>\n\nTo Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder admitted specifically instructing Liddy on the second Watergate break-in, something which he had earlier denied. At the time these interviews were conducted, Magruder was a Presbyterian minister in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name=\"colodny\">Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 2003 Magruder was interviewed again, by PBS researchers and the Associated Press. According to his account in a [[PBS]] documentary, ''Watergate Plus 30: Shadow of History'', and in an interview with the [[Associated Press]], he asserted that Nixon knew about the Watergate burglary early in the process, and well before the scandal broke.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During the 2003 interviews, Magruder said that he had attended a meeting with Mitchell on March 30, 1972, at which he heard Nixon tell Mitchell by telephone to begin the Watergate plan. This account, however, has been contested by [[Fred LaRue]]. LaRue, who was the only other person present at the meeting in which the alleged telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell occurred, has said that no telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell took place during this meeting.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Magruder was the only direct participant of the scandal to claim that President Nixon had specific prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary, and that Nixon directed Mitchell to proceed with the burglary. These statements contradicted Magruder's earlier accounts that the cover-up had reached no higher in the Administration than Mitchell.\n\nIn his 1974 book, Magruder had said that the only telephone call from the White House during this meeting came from H.R. Haldeman's aide, [[Gordon C. Strachan]]. Sixteen years later, in the August 7, 1990 interview with Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder changed his account, claiming that the telephone call from the White House came from Haldeman himself. In 2003, Magruder changed his account again, saying that President Nixon had telephoned Mitchell at the Key Biscayne meeting.\n\n==Later years==\nOn July 23, 2007, Magruder was hospitalized after crashing his car into a motorcycle and a truck on [[Ohio State Route 315|State Route 315]] in Columbus Ohio.<ref>{{Citation\n |last      = Marx\n |first     = Matthew\n |title     = Watergate figure hospitalized after Rt. 315 crash\n |newspaper = The Columbus Dispatch\n |date      = 2007-07-23\n |url       = http://www.dispatch.com/dispatch/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/24/magruder.html\n}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was later reported that Magruder had suffered a stroke while driving.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title =News Briefs\n  | newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch\n  | date =2007-07-28\n  | url =http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/07/24/magruder.html}}</ref> He was charged with failure to maintain an assured clear distance and failure to stop after an accident or collision.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Decker\n  | first =Theodore\n  | title =Ex-Nixon aide charged in two crashes\n  | newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch\n  | date =2007-07-26\n  | url =http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/07/26/JEBCHARGED.ART_ART_07-26-07_B4_787CNKS.html}}</ref> Magruder pleaded guilty in January 2008 to a charge of reckless operation stemming from the crashes with two vehicles in July.

In August 1973, Magruder pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to wiretap, obstruct justice and defraud the United States. He served seven months in federal prison.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-jeb-stuart-magruder-20140517-story.html</ref>\n\nMagruder later attended [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He spoke publicly about ethics and his role in the Watergate scandal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he gave interviews in which he changed his accounts of actions by various participants in the Watergate coverup, including claiming that [[President Richard Nixon]] ordered the break-ins.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/jeb-magruder-79-nixon-aide-jailed-for-watergate-dies.html</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-bz6154fh47 1973 Watergate Hearings; 1973-06-14; Part 1 of 6], 1:04:59, [[Library of Congress]], [[American Archive of Public Broadcasting]] (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC<ref name=\"AAPB\">{{cite web | title =1973 Watergate Hearings; 1973-06-14; Part 1 of 6 | work = | publisher =[[Library of Congress]], [[American Archive of Public Broadcasting]] (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC | date = June 13, 1973| url =http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-bz6154fh47 | accessdate =January 20, 2018 }}\n [https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/exhibits/Watergate_Episode_Guide.pdf Episode Guide]</ref> }}\n\nJeb Stuart Magruder was born and grew up on [[Staten Island, New York]]. His father, a Civil War buff, named him for Confederate general [[J.E.B. Stuart]].<ref>Martin, Douglas \"Jeb Magruder, 79, Nixon Aide Jailed for Watergate, Dies\" https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/jeb-magruder-79-nixon-aide-jailed-for-watergate-dies.html</ref> He was an honor student at [[Curtis High School]]. Magruder was an excellent junior tennis player and swimmer, among the best in the greater New York area.<ref>Magruder, p. 17</ref> He earned a Bachelor of Arts in [[political science]] in 1958 from [[Williams College]], where he competed on the [[varsity team|varsity]] swimming team and set several regional records.<ref>Magruder, pp. 18-29</ref> During an intermission from college, he served in the [[U.S. Army]] for 21 months, and was stationed in [[South Korea]].<ref>Magruder, pp. 21\u201324</ref> He earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>Magruder, p. 36</ref>\n\nMagruder worked for [[IBM]] after college. He moved to San Francisco to take a position with the Crown Zellerbach firm, where he worked in its sales and marketing department. Later he started his own consumer products company.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHe married Gail Barnes Nicholas on October 17, 1959, in [[Brentwood, California]].<ref>Magruder, pp. 29\u201333</ref> The couple had four children. They were divorced in 1984.\n\nMagruder married Patricia Newton on February 28, 1987, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. They were divorced in May 2003.\n\n==Business career and politics==\nIn the late 1950s, Magruder moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] with Jewel Tea, in a transfer for work. He became involved there as a campaign manager for the Republican Party during the 1960 election campaign, working as chairman of an urban ward.<ref>Magruder, p. 35</ref>\n\nMagruder moved to Chicago for his [[MBA]] studies. Afterward he shifted from IBM to the consulting firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. In Chicago he remained involved with the Republican Party. His first major political job was managing the successful 1962 [[primary election|primary]] campaign of [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for the Republican nomination to the [[United States House of Representatives]], preparing for the election in [[Illinois' 13th congressional district]]. Rumsfeld won the primary and the seat in Congress, in a major upset in a ward traditionally dominated by Democrats and unions.  The win catapulted Magruder into the early ranks of young political technocrats who used data and analytics to engineer campaigns, and it caught the attention of the Republican party machine.<ref>Magruder, pp. 37\u201339</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Magruder moved from Booz Allen Hamilton to [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]], a regional grocery firm. During his nearly four years with them, he was promoted to merchandise manager.<ref>Magruder, pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nMagruder became involved with the Illinois organization of the [[Barry Goldwater]] presidential campaign in late 1963, but became disillusioned with Goldwater's political views.<ref>Magruder, pp. 43\u201345</ref> He worked briefly as campaign manager for [[Richard Ogilvie]]'s 1966 campaign for president of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Board of Supervisors. The political workload, combined with work pressures, caused Magruder to end employment with Jewel.\n\nHe relocated to California in mid-1966, to begin a higher level job with the [[Broadway Stores]] company.<ref>Magruder, pp. 46\u201351</ref> Magruder's next political involvement started in mid-1967, when he served as Southern California coordinator for the [[Richard Nixon]] presidential campaign. He left early in 1968 due to internal organizational problems.<ref>Magruder, 51\u201354</ref>\n\nMagruder entered partnership during early 1969 with two other entrepreneurs to start two new businesses, and became president and chief executive officer of these firms.<ref>Magruder, pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n\n==Joins White House staff==\nMagruder, while working in Los Angeles as a business executive, was approached through Republican acquaintances and asked to interview to join the White House staff. He was appointed to the [[White House]] staff in 1969 at age 34, as Special Assistant to the President. Like some other private sector executives, he took a pay cut to join public service. He moved with his family to Washington, D.C.<ref>Magruder, pp. 9-10</ref> He worked for Nixon operatives [[H.R. Haldeman]] and [[Herbert G. Klein]], Communications Director for the Executive Branch. Magruder's formal title was Deputy Director of White House Communications. \n \n===Committee to Re-elect the President===\n{{Watergate|CRP}}\nMagruder served in the White House until the spring of 1971, when he left to manage the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP, also known as CREEP), first as Director. By early 1972 in the election year, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] took over as director of CREEP and Magruder acted as his deputy. As Mitchell became preoccupied with a scandal involving the [[ITT Corporation]] and by his efforts to restrain his outspoken wife [[Martha Mitchell|Martha]], Magruder took on more of the management of the CREEP.<ref>[[H.R. Haldeman]], ''The Ends of Power'', New York: New York Times Books, 1978, p.9</ref>\n\nThe campaign to re-elect the President was extraordinarily [[1972 U.S. presidential election|successful]], winning 49 of 50 states; Nixon lost only [[Massachusetts]] and the [[District of Columbia]] to Democrat [[George McGovern]]. The final tally of Nixon's victory was 520 to 17 electoral votes, the second largest [[Electoral College (United States)]] margin in history up until then, after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1936 victory over [[Alf Landon]], (523 to 8).\n\n===Manages 1973 Inaugural===\nMagruder worked as Inaugural Director from October 1972 to arrange [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[United States presidential inauguration]] ceremony and celebration in January 1973.<ref>Magruder, pp. 298\u2013303</ref> In March 1973, he began a job as Director of Policy Planning with the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. He resigned soon afterward, as the Watergate scandal began to heat up and become scrutinized again by media following [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]]'s disclosures of [[perjury]] during the original Watergate trial of the five burglars; the former Watergate burglar wrote about this to the ''[[Washington Star]].'' <ref>Magruder, pp. 310\u2013318</ref>\n\n==Watergate scandal==\nMagruder, in his role with CREEP, was involved with the Watergate matters from an early stage, including its planning, execution, and cover-up.\n\n===Liddy plan===\nMagruder met with White House Counsel [[John Dean]] and [[John N. Mitchell]] (Attorney General of the United States and Director of CREEP) on January 27 and February 4, 1972, to review preliminary plans by [[G. Gordon Liddy]] (Counsel to CREEP) for intelligence gathering ideas for the 1972 campaign. The Watergate burglaries would evolve from those meetings. From the day they met in December 1971, Magruder and Liddy (who had been hired by Mitchell and Dean) had a conflicted personal relationship.<ref>Magruder, pp. 185\u2013197</ref>\n\n===Cooperates with prosecutors===\nDuring April 1973, Magruder began cooperating with federal [[prosecutor]]s. In exchange, Magruder was allowed to plead guilty in August 1973 to a one-count indictment of [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to obstruct justice, to defraud the United States, and to illegally eavesdrop on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s national headquarters at the [[Watergate Hotel]]. On May 21, 1974, Magruder was sentenced by Judge [[John Sirica]] to ten months to four years for his role in the failed burglary of Watergate and the following cover-up. After his sentencing, Magruder said, \"I am confident that this country will survive its Watergates and its Jeb Magruders.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the end, he served seven months of his sentence (in a Federal prison in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]]).\n\n[[File:Jeb Magruder, photo portrait, Nixon administration, black and white.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Jeb Stuart Magruder as a member of the Nixon Administration.]]\nMagruder originally testified that he knew nothing to indicate that President Nixon had any prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary.\n\nIn his book, ''An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate'' (1974), he wrote, \n<blockquote>I know nothing to indicate that Nixon was aware in advance of the plan to break into the Democratic headquarters. It is possible that Mitchell or Haldeman told him in advance, but I think it's likelier that they would not have mentioned it unless the operation had produced some results of interest to him.</blockquote>{{page needed|date=September 2015}} This book was published before Magruder's sentencing on May 21, and before Nixon resigned as the President.\n\nMagruder had testified that he thought that he was helping establish a legal [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence-gathering]] operation. In his book Magruder wrote about former Attorney General John Mitchell and [[Fred LaRue]] meeting in late March 1972 in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]]. He wrote that Mitchell approved the plan to eavesdrop on the Watergate complex soon after this meeting.<ref>Magruder, pp. 210\u2013215</ref>\n\n==After Watergate==\nAfter his prison term, Magruder began a speaking tour on college campuses and in other public spaces, inspiring some critics to suggest he had profited from the scandal and his decision to turn state's evidence.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/28/archives/jeb-magruder-superstar.html</ref> He published a Christian-oriented memoir, ''From Power to Peace'' in 1976. He earned a [[Master of Divinity]] degree from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1981 and became ordained as a [[Presbyterian]] minister. He served as associate minister at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Burlingame, California]] and First Community Church of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. (While there, Magruder chaired that city's Commission on Ethics and Values for a time.) In May 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] denied a request from Magruder for a presidential [[pardon]].<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/jeb.html</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Magruder was called as senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In 1995, [[Kentucky]] Governor [[Brereton Jones]] reinstated Magruder's right to campaign for public office in the state.\n\n===Continued controversy===\nIn 1990 Magruder consented to interviews with authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin while the two were conducting research for their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' (St. Martin's Press). Magruder admitted that he had lied to prosecutors, to the Senate's Watergate Committee, and in his 1974 book ''An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate'', concerning aspects of the early cover-up.\n\nTo Colodny and Gettlin, he said that he had called [[John Dean]] several hours after the (second) Watergate break-in was discovered, and that Dean set in motion several cover-up strategies. This version of events tallied closely with that of [[Gordon Liddy]], as set out in his 1980 book ''Will''. Books published earlier by others, however, such as Magruder's in 1974 and Dean's ''Blind Ambition'' (1976), had become the accepted 'truth' of the cover-up. These versions had very profound and damaging effects on the reputations of senior figures such as [[H.R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]], and [[John N. Mitchell]].<ref name=\"colodny\"/>\n\nTo Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder admitted specifically instructing Liddy on the second Watergate break-in, something which he had earlier denied. At the time these interviews were conducted, Magruder was a Presbyterian minister in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name=\"colodny\">Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 2003 Magruder was interviewed again, by PBS researchers and the Associated Press. According to his account in a [[PBS]] documentary, ''Watergate Plus 30: Shadow of History'', and in an interview with the [[Associated Press]], he asserted that Nixon knew about the Watergate burglary early in the process, and well before the scandal broke.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During the 2003 interviews, Magruder said that he had attended a meeting with Mitchell on March 30, 1972, at which he heard Nixon tell Mitchell by telephone to begin the Watergate plan. This account, however, has been contested by [[Fred LaRue]]. LaRue, who was the only other person present at the meeting in which the alleged telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell occurred, has said that no telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell took place during this meeting.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Magruder was the only direct participant of the scandal to claim that President Nixon had specific prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary, and that Nixon directed Mitchell to proceed with the burglary. These statements contradicted Magruder's earlier accounts that the cover-up had reached no higher in the Administration than Mitchell.\n\nIn his 1974 book, Magruder had said that the only telephone call from the White House during this meeting came from H.R. Haldeman's aide, [[Gordon C. Strachan]]. Sixteen years later, in the August 7, 1990 interview with Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder changed his account, claiming that the telephone call from the White House came from Haldeman himself. In 2003, Magruder changed his account again, saying that President Nixon had telephoned Mitchell at the Key Biscayne meeting.\n\n==Later years==\nOn July 23, 2007, Magruder was hospitalized after crashing his car into a motorcycle and a truck on [[Ohio State Route 315|State Route 315]] in Columbus Ohio.<ref>{{Citation\n |last      = Marx\n |first     = Matthew\n |title     = Watergate figure hospitalized after Rt. 315 crash\n |newspaper = The Columbus Dispatch\n |date      = 2007-07-23\n |url       = http://www.dispatch.com/dispatch/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/24/magruder.html\n}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was later reported that Magruder had suffered a stroke while driving.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title =News Briefs\n  | newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch\n  | date =2007-07-28\n  | url =http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/07/24/magruder.html}}</ref> He was charged with failure to maintain an assured clear distance and failure to stop after an accident or collision.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Decker\n  | first =Theodore\n  | title =Ex-Nixon aide charged in two crashes\n  | newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch\n  | date =2007-07-26\n  | url =http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/07/26/JEBCHARGED.ART_ART_07-26-07_B4_787CNKS.html}}</ref> Magruder pleaded guilty in January 2008 to a charge of reckless operation stemming from the crashes with two vehicles in July.
