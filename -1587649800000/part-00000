The first MUD, known as [[MUD1]], was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain.  A MUD is a virtual world with many players interacting in real time.<ref>Mitchell, Don.

Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players.  Such early worlds began the MUD heritage that eventually led to [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, more commonly known as MMORPGs, a genre of role-playing games in which a large number of players interact  within a virtual world.\n\nSome prototype virtual worlds were ''[[WorldsAway]]'', a two-dimensional chat environment where users designed their own avatars; ''[[Dreamscape (chat)|Dreamscape]],'' an interactive community featuring a virtual world by [[CompuServe]]; [[Cityspace]], an educational networking and 3D computer graphics project for children; and ''[[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]]'', a 2-dimensional community driven virtual world.

For example, ''EverQuest'' time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.\n\nAs ''virtual world'' is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include\n* [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games,<ref name=\"Bell2008-virtualworld\"/> meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the [[Google Maps]] API or through a simple virtual [[geocaching]] of \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" on [[WikiMapia]] or similar [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mash-ups]], where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of [[mixed reality]].\n* [[Collaborative virtual environment]]s (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment.\n* Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds,<ref name=\"Kaplan, Andreas M. 2009\">Kaplan, Andreas M.; Haenlein, Michael (2009). \"The fairyland of Second Life: About virtual social worlds and how to use them\".

While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency.<ref name=\"IJMR Article\"/><ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\">{{cite journal |author=Robinson, E.

The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of [[Second Life]], however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world.<ref>Castronova, Edward, et al. \"A Test of the Law of Demand in a Virtual World: Exploring the Petri Dish.\" Discoveries in Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations: New Interdisciplinary Applications (2011): 301.</ref> In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in ''Diablo II''.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/>\n\nThe value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them.

Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Indalecio, Tina. Psychology Today. How Much Of An Individual\u2019s Virtual Identity, Is Really - Real? Exploring Identity in the Virtual World - Is that REALLY you?\n1991\u20132012. Sussex Publishers, LLC. 30 April 2010</ref> However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it.  The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace.  Instead, it has become the individual's bridge between the physical and virtual world, a  conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors.<ref>McCreery, Michael Patrick. UNLV University Libraries. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Personality, Presence, And The Virtual Self: A Fivefactor Model Approach To Behavioral Analysis Within A Virtual Environment\". 201.</ref> The avatar becomes the person's alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.\n\nWhile greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to \u201clive person\u201d relationships (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0015485|title=Time out of mind: Dissociation in the virtual world|year=2009|last1=Toronto|first1=Ellen|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|url=https://www.recoveryonpurpose.com/upload/Time%20out%20of%20Mind%20Dissociation%20in%20the%20Virtual%20World.pdf}}</ref> When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they don't ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape.\n\nAnother area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael's College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.003|title=Video game experience predicts virtual, but not real navigation performance|year=2011|last1=Richardson|first1=Anthony E.|last2=Powers|first2=Morgan E.|last3=Bousquet|first3=Lauren G.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=552\u2013560}}</ref> An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups\u2019 performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.<ref>Satalich, Glenna (1995). \"[http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html Navigation and Wayfinding in Virtual Reality: Finding Proper Tools and Cues to Enhance Navigation Awareness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105102730/http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html |date=January 5, 2013 }}\".

Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as [[six degrees of freedom]] often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces.\n\nLike video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced [[graphics processing unit]]s distributed by [[Nvidia]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds.  However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware.  The first virtual world of this kind was [[Whyville]].net, launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Routledge\"/> built by [[Numedeon]] inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=8402097B2|title=Determining a manner in which user interface commands are processed in an instant messaging environment|status=patent|gdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Application domains==\n[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|A film made in [[Second Life]] using [[machinima]].]]\n\n===Social===\n{{more citations needed section |date=April 2008}}\nAlthough the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D Games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video-conferences.  Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like-minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.<ref>Schroeder, Ralph (1999).

They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use.{{Citation needed|reason=This is just a very strong (and general) claim not supported by next paragraph's citation|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[Starlight Children's Foundation]] helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or [[autism]] for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick.

For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can \"emote\" quite simply.  And a familiarization with said or similar \"emotes\" or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth.  Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one's interaction with real-life interactions.{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Commercial'''\n\nAs businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market.\n\nMany companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these \u201cvirtual stores\u201d is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within \"virtual worlds\" is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this \"in-house\". An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.\n\nUsing virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback.  Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.<ref name=\"Wasko 2011\">{{cite journal\n |last        = Wasko\n |first       = Molly\n |last2       = Teigland\n |first2      = Robin\n |last3       = Leidner\n |first3      = Dorothy\n |last4       = Jarvenpaa\n |first4      = Sirkka\n |year        = 2011\n |title       = Stepping into the Internet: New Ventures in Virtual Worlds\n |journal     = MIS Quarterly\n |volume      = 35\n |issue       = 3\n |pages = 645\n |url         = http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132301/http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-04-25\n|doi = 10.2307/23042801\n |jstor = 23042801\n }}</ref>\n\nUsing virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business.\n\nAnother use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.\n\nAccording to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com |title=The leading virtual worlds trade media company. in New York |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> commercial investments in the \"virtual worlds\" sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2007/q4.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2008/q1.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>  However, the selection process for defining a \"virtual worlds\" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/04/analysis_virtual_worlds_and_in.php |title=Worlds In Motion - Analysis: Virtual Worlds And Investment, Q1 2008 |publisher=Worldsinmotion.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>\n\n====E-commerce (legal)====\nA number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of [[Ginko Financial]], a bank system featured in [[Second Life]] where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to [[Economy of Second Life|Linden Dollars]] for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of [[Ginko Financial]].<ref>Talbot, David.

Virtual Worlds such as ''[[Eve Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]'' also have people and systems that govern them.<ref name=\"Haskins\">Haskins, Walaika (July 31, 2008), [http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/64002.html Who polices Virtual Worlds?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nProviders of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. ''[[Second Life]]'' for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as ''[[Habbo]]'' enforce clear rules for behaviour,<ref name=\"Haskins\"/> as seen in their terms and conditions.<ref>Habbo Hotel (blog), [http://blog.habbo.com/house-rules/ Habbo Hotel House Rules] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nIn some instances virtual worlds don't need established rules of conduct because actions such as \u2018killing\u2019 another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect.<ref name=\"Haskins\"/>\n\nInstances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to \u00a33,115.<ref>BBC (July 3, 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8132547.stm Billions stolen in online robbery] Access date: February 2013.</ref> The player in question has now been suspended as trading in-game cash for real money is against Eve Online's terms and conditions.<ref>Stockley, Mark (October 1, 2009), [http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/10/01/guest-blog-polices-crime-virtual-world/ Who polices crime in a virtual world?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n{{See also|MMOG}}\nThere are many [[MMORPG]] virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are [[IMVU]] for Windows, [[PlayStation Home]] for [[PlayStation 3]], and Second Life for Windows.\nMany Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode,    PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin.\n\n====Single-player games====\n\nSome [[single-player video game]]s contain virtual worlds populated by [[non-player character]]s (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.)\n\nThe virtual worlds found in [[video game]]s are often split into discrete [[level (video gaming)|levels]].\n\nSingle-player games such as ''[[Minecraft]]'' allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the [[server (computing)|server]] is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.\n\nAt one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of ''[[Halo 3]]'' or ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is just as much a big database as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia.\n\n==Use in education==\n{{See also |Virtual learning environment |Online communication between school and home}}\n\nVirtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | last=Kluge | first=Stacy\n | last2=Riley| first2=Elizabeth\n | title=Teaching in Virtual Worlds: Opportunities and Challenges\n | year=2008\n | journal=Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology\n | volume=5\n | pages=127\u2013135\n | url=http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2008/IISITv5p127-135Kluge459.pdf\n | ref=harv\n | doi=10.28945/1000\n }}\n</ref> Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their [[interactive whiteboard]] with the [[Open-source software|open-source]] project [[Edusim]]. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602|last1 = Jon|first1 = Allan|last2 = MacCreadie|first2 = Alex|last3 = MacCreadie|first3 = Tracey|year = 2010|publisher = Unpublished}}</ref>\n\nMulti-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.\n\nVirtual worlds can also be used with [[virtual learning environment]]s, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge [[Second Life]] with [[Moodle]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last=Livingstone | first=D.\n | last2=Kemp | first2=J.\n | year=\n | title=Integrating Web-Based and 3D Learning Environments: Second Life Meets Moodle\n | journal= UPGRADE (European Journal for the Informatics Professional)\n | volume=9 | issue=3\n | pages=8\u201314\n | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/2008-III-sowe.pdf\n | ref=harv\n}} \n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable.  Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face.\n\nSome virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is [[Whyville]] launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Richard Lee Colvin\"/> which targets kids and teenagers, offering  them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in [[Whyville]] vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.\n\nSome multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of [[Second Life]] for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL)<ref>Par Janusz Arabski, Adam Wojtaszek (2011). The Acquisition of L2 Phonology.

The initial game could only be played on an [[Imlac PDS-1|Imlac]], as it was specifically designed for this type of computer.\n\nThe first virtual worlds presented on the [[Internet]] were communities and [[chat room]]s, some of which evolved into [[MUD]]s and [[MUSH]]es. The first MUD, known as [[MUD1]], was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain.

Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players.

For example, ''EverQuest'' time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.\n\nAs ''virtual world'' is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include\n* [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games,<ref name=\"Bell2008-virtualworld\"/> meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the [[Google Maps]] API or through a simple virtual [[geocaching]] of \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" on [[WikiMapia]] or similar [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mash-ups]], where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of [[mixed reality]].\n* [[Collaborative virtual environment]]s (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment.\n* Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds,<ref name=\"Kaplan, Andreas M. 2009\">Kaplan, Andreas M.; Haenlein, Michael (2009). \"The fairyland of Second Life: About virtual social worlds and how to use them\".

While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency.<ref name=\"IJMR Article\"/><ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\">{{cite journal |author=Robinson, E.

The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of [[Second Life]], however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world.<ref>Castronova, Edward, et al. \"A Test of the Law of Demand in a Virtual World: Exploring the Petri Dish.\" Discoveries in Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations: New Interdisciplinary Applications (2011): 301.</ref> In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in ''Diablo II''.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/>\n\nThe value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them.

Special websites such as [[GamerDNA]], [[Koinup]] and others which serve as social networks for virtual worlds users are facing some crucial issues as the DataPortability of [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s across many virtual worlds and MMORPGs.<ref>Brady Forrest, [http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/12/post-2.html/ \"Wow and Cottage Industries\"]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, O'Really Radar, December 4, 2006</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds offer advertisers the potential for virtual advertisements, such as the [[in-game advertising]] already found in a number of video games.\n\n===Geography===\nThe geography of virtual worlds can vary widely because the role of geography and space is an important design component over which the developers of virtual worlds have control and may choose to alter.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/> Virtual worlds are, at least superficially, digital instantiations of three-dimensional space. As a result, considerations of geography in virtual worlds (such as World of Warcraft) often revolve around \u201cspatial narratives\u201d in which players act out a nomadic hero's journey along the lines of that present in ''The Odyssey''.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1555412006292618|title=Blood Scythes, Festivals, Quests, and Backstories|year=2006|last1=Krzywinska|first1=Tanya|journal=Games and Culture|volume=1|issue=4|pages=383\u2013396}}</ref> The creation of fantastic places is also a reoccurring theme in the geographic study of virtual worlds, although, perhaps counterintuitively, the heaviest users of virtual worlds often downgrade the sensory stimuli of the world's fantastic places in order to make themselves more efficient at core tasks in the world, such as killing monsters.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/anq.0.0110|title=Being in the World (of Warcraft): Raiding, Realism, and Knowledge Production in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game|year=2010|last1=Golub|first1=Alex|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=83|pages=17\u201345}}</ref> However, the geographic component of some worlds may only be a geographic veneer atop an otherwise nonspatial core structure.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/> For instance, while imposing geographic constraints upon users when they quest for items, these constraints may be removed when they sell items in a geographically unconstrained auction house.

The [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] for example have funded research into virtual worlds including, for example, how preteens explore and share information about reproductive health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spotlight.macfound.org/main/entry/thomas_kafai_tweens_reproductive_health_virtual_worlds/#When:14:03:00Z|title=Thomas & Kafai: Tweens and Reproductive Health in Virtual Worlds, 2008-08-09|accessdate=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623030550/http://spotlight.macfound.org/main/entry/thomas_kafai_tweens_reproductive_health_virtual_worlds#When:14:03:00Z|archive-date=23 June 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A larger set of studies on children's social and political use of the virtual world [[Whyville]].net has also been published in the book \"Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World\"  Authored by Yasmin B. Kafai, Deborah A. Fields, and Mizuko Ito.<ref>{{cite book|title=Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World (The John D and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning). |publisher=MIT Press }}</ref>  Several other research publications now specifically address the use of virtual worlds for education.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nOther research focused more on adults explores the reasons for indulging and the emotions of virtual world users. Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Indalecio, Tina. Psychology Today. How Much Of An Individual\u2019s Virtual Identity, Is Really - Real? Exploring Identity in the Virtual World - Is that REALLY you?\n1991\u20132012. Sussex Publishers, LLC. 30 April 2010</ref> However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it.  The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace.  Instead, it has become the individual's bridge between the physical and virtual world, a  conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors.<ref>McCreery, Michael Patrick. UNLV University Libraries. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Personality, Presence, And The Virtual Self: A Fivefactor Model Approach To Behavioral Analysis Within A Virtual Environment\". 201.</ref> The avatar becomes the person's alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.\n\nWhile greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to \u201clive person\u201d relationships (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0015485|title=Time out of mind: Dissociation in the virtual world|year=2009|last1=Toronto|first1=Ellen|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|url=https://www.recoveryonpurpose.com/upload/Time%20out%20of%20Mind%20Dissociation%20in%20the%20Virtual%20World.pdf}}</ref> When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they don't ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape.\n\nAnother area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael's College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.003|title=Video game experience predicts virtual, but not real navigation performance|year=2011|last1=Richardson|first1=Anthony E.|last2=Powers|first2=Morgan E.|last3=Bousquet|first3=Lauren G.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=552\u2013560}}</ref> An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups\u2019 performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.<ref>Satalich, Glenna (1995). \"[http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html Navigation and Wayfinding in Virtual Reality: Finding Proper Tools and Cues to Enhance Navigation Awareness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105102730/http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html |date=January 5, 2013 }}\".

University of Washington, USA.</ref>\n\n==Hardware==\nUnlike most video games, which are usually navigated using various free-ranging [[human interface device]]s (HIDs), virtual worlds are usually navigated (as of 2009) using HIDs which are designed and oriented around flat, 2-dimensional [[graphical user interface]]s; as most comparatively inexpensive computer [[mouse (computing)|mice]] are manufactured and distributed for 2-dimensional UI navigation, the lack of 3D-capable HID usage among most virtual world users is likely due to both the lack of penetration of 3D-capable devices into non-niche, non-gaming markets as well as the generally higher pricing of such devices compared to 2-dimensional HIDs. Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as [[six degrees of freedom]] often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces.\n\nLike video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced [[graphics processing unit]]s distributed by [[Nvidia]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds.  However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware.  The first virtual world of this kind was [[Whyville]].net, launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Routledge\"/> built by [[Numedeon]] inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=8402097B2|title=Determining a manner in which user interface commands are processed in an instant messaging environment|status=patent|gdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Application domains==\n[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|A film made in [[Second Life]] using [[machinima]].]]\n\n===Social===\n{{more citations needed section |date=April 2008}}\nAlthough the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D Games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video-conferences.  Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like-minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.<ref>Schroeder, Ralph (1999).

They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use.{{Citation needed|reason=This is just a very strong (and general) claim not supported by next paragraph's citation|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[Starlight Children's Foundation]] helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or [[autism]] for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick.  Virtual worlds also enable them to experience and act beyond the restrictions of their illness and help to relieve stress.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last=UT Dallas\n | date=November 18, 2007\n | title=Avatars Help Asperger Syndrome Patients Learn to Play the Game of Life\n | url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2007/11/18-003.html\n | ref=harv\n }}\n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds can help players become more familiar and comfortable with actions they may in real-life feel reluctant or embarrassed.  For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can \"emote\" quite simply.  And a familiarization with said or similar \"emotes\" or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth.  Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one's interaction with real-life interactions.{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Commercial'''\n\nAs businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market.\n\nMany companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these \u201cvirtual stores\u201d is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within \"virtual worlds\" is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this \"in-house\". An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.\n\nUsing virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback.  Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.<ref name=\"Wasko 2011\">{{cite journal\n |last        = Wasko\n |first       = Molly\n |last2       = Teigland\n |first2      = Robin\n |last3       = Leidner\n |first3      = Dorothy\n |last4       = Jarvenpaa\n |first4      = Sirkka\n |year        = 2011\n |title       = Stepping into the Internet: New Ventures in Virtual Worlds\n |journal     = MIS Quarterly\n |volume      = 35\n |issue       = 3\n |pages = 645\n |url         = http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132301/http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-04-25\n|doi = 10.2307/23042801\n |jstor = 23042801\n }}</ref>\n\nUsing virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business.\n\nAnother use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.\n\nAccording to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com |title=The leading virtual worlds trade media company. in New York |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> commercial investments in the \"virtual worlds\" sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2007/q4.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2008/q1.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>  However, the selection process for defining a \"virtual worlds\" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/04/analysis_virtual_worlds_and_in.php |title=Worlds In Motion - Analysis: Virtual Worlds And Investment, Q1 2008 |publisher=Worldsinmotion.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>\n\n====E-commerce (legal)====\nA number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of [[Ginko Financial]], a bank system featured in [[Second Life]] where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to [[Economy of Second Life|Linden Dollars]] for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of [[Ginko Financial]].<ref>Talbot, David.

Virtual Worlds such as ''[[Eve Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]'' also have people and systems that govern them.<ref name=\"Haskins\">Haskins, Walaika (July 31, 2008), [http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/64002.html Who polices Virtual Worlds?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nProviders of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. ''[[Second Life]]'' for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as ''[[Habbo]]'' enforce clear rules for behaviour,<ref name=\"Haskins\"/> as seen in their terms and conditions.<ref>Habbo Hotel (blog), [http://blog.habbo.com/house-rules/ Habbo Hotel House Rules] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nIn some instances virtual worlds don't need established rules of conduct because actions such as \u2018killing\u2019 another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect.<ref name=\"Haskins\"/>\n\nInstances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to \u00a33,115.<ref>BBC (July 3, 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8132547.stm Billions stolen in online robbery] Access date: February 2013.</ref> The player in question has now been suspended as trading in-game cash for real money is against Eve Online's terms and conditions.<ref>Stockley, Mark (October 1, 2009), [http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/10/01/guest-blog-polices-crime-virtual-world/ Who polices crime in a virtual world?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n{{See also|MMOG}}\nThere are many [[MMORPG]] virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are IMVU for Windows, [[PlayStation Home]] for [[PlayStation 3]], and Second Life for Windows.\nMany Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode,    PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin.\n\n====Single-player games====\n\nSome [[single-player video game]]s contain virtual worlds populated by [[non-player character]]s (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.)\n\nThe virtual worlds found in [[video game]]s are often split into discrete [[level (video gaming)|levels]].\n\nSingle-player games such as ''[[Minecraft]]'' allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the [[server (computing)|server]] is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.\n\nAt one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of ''[[Halo 3]]'' or ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is just as much a big database as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia.\n\n==Use in education==\n{{See also |Virtual learning environment |Online communication between school and home}}\n\nVirtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | last=Kluge | first=Stacy\n | last2=Riley| first2=Elizabeth\n | title=Teaching in Virtual Worlds: Opportunities and Challenges\n | year=2008\n | journal=Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology\n | volume=5\n | pages=127\u2013135\n | url=http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2008/IISITv5p127-135Kluge459.pdf\n | ref=harv\n | doi=10.28945/1000\n }}\n</ref> Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their [[interactive whiteboard]] with the [[Open-source software|open-source]] project [[Edusim]]. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602|last1 = Jon|first1 = Allan|last2 = MacCreadie|first2 = Alex|last3 = MacCreadie|first3 = Tracey|year = 2010|publisher = Unpublished}}</ref>\n\nMulti-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.\n\nVirtual worlds can also be used with [[virtual learning environment]]s, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge [[Second Life]] with [[Moodle]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last=Livingstone | first=D.\n | last2=Kemp | first2=J.\n | year=\n | title=Integrating Web-Based and 3D Learning Environments: Second Life Meets Moodle\n | journal= UPGRADE (European Journal for the Informatics Professional)\n | volume=9 | issue=3\n | pages=8\u201314\n | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/2008-III-sowe.pdf\n | ref=harv\n}} \n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable.  Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face.\n\nSome virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is [[Whyville]] launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Richard Lee Colvin\"/> which targets kids and teenagers, offering  them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in [[Whyville]] vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.\n\nSome multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of [[Second Life]] for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL)<ref>Par Janusz Arabski, Adam Wojtaszek (2011). The Acquisition of L2 Phonology.

The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities formed after Kevin was abused as a child by his mother after his father left on a train one day and never returned. The dominant personality, \"Barry,\" controls when and which of the others can manifest. \"Barry\" has not allowed \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have control due to their undesirable traits and their belief in \"The Beast,\" an 24th personality who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher recognizes in their sessions that \"Dennis\" has recently displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.\n\n\"Dennis\" imprisons the girls in an underground cell. By taking advantage of a childlike personality called \"Hedwig\", the girls attempt to escape and Casey manages to find a walkie-talkie but her attempts to get help are dismissed as a prank. The girls are separated from each other by \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\". Fletcher visits Kevin's quarters, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast\". Fletcher realises that there is an internal conflict between the personalities and becomes suspicious. She feigns going to the bathroom, finds Claire who is locked in a storage room. \"Dennis\" appears and sedates Fletcher. \"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to take over, who has enhanced physical abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already killed and [[Human cannibalism|eaten]] some of Marcia and sees him attack Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice who only sustains minor wounds. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked by the police if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world. In a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives.

He explained, \"In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me.

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]]. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don\u2019t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \u201cvilify and demonize [[mental illness]] in general, and DID in particular,\u201d the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

''Split'' is noted as the first solo [[supervillain]] origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities formed after Kevin was abused as a child by his mother after his father left on a train one day and never returned. The dominant personality, \"Barry,\" controls when and which of the others can manifest. \"Barry\" has not allowed \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have control due to their undesirable traits and their belief in \"The Beast,\" an 24th personality who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher recognizes in their sessions that \"Dennis\" has recently displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.  ot \n\n\"Dennis\" imprisons the girls in an underground cell. By taking advantage of a childlike personality called \"Hedwig\", the girls attempt to escape and Casey manages to find a walkie-talkie but her attempts to get help are dismissed as a prank. The girls are separated from each other by \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\". Fletcher visits Kevin's quarters, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast\". Fletcher realises that there is an internal conflict between the personalities and becomes suspicious. She feigns going to the bathroom, finds Claire who is locked in a storage room. \"Dennis\" appears and sedates Fletcher. \"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to take over, who has enhanced physical abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already killed and [[Human cannibalism|eaten]] some of Marcia and sees him attack Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice who only sustains minor wounds. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked by the police if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world. In a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, \"The Beast\": a grotesque and cannibalistic sociopath with superhuman capabilities, such as inhuman bodily strength, enhanced speed and agility, along with near-invulnerability and unnatural mobility, to the point of being able to scale walls and ceilings, but resulting in his insatiable hunger for raw human flesh.\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Casey Cooke, a teenage girl with a traumatic past and a history of [[self-harm]], who is kidnapped by \"Dennis\", one of Kevin's personalities, to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n**Izzie Coffey as 5&nbsp;year-old Casey\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Karen Fletcher, a [[psychologist]] who attempts to help Kevin with his DID, and believes that DID can, in extreme cases, cause physiological changes.\n* [[Haley Lu Richardson]] as Claire Benoit, Mr.&nbsp;Benoit's daughter, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Marcia, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Jessica Sula]] as Marcia, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Claire, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as John Cooke, Casey's paternal uncle.\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Mr. Cooke, Casey's father.\n* [[Neal Huff]] as Mr. Benoit, Claire's father.\n* [[Kim Director]] as Hannah.\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as academic moderator.\n* [[M.

He explained, \"In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in \u2013 humor and suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |title='Power comes from writing.'

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]]. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don\u2019t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \u201cvilify and demonize [[mental illness]] in general, and DID in particular,\u201d the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

An Italian translation was published in 1979. The book argued that colonialism was hardly limited to overseas colonies.

The book presented two separate but related arguments. The first was couched at the level of regions. This argument holds that the lack of political sovereignty characteristic of internal colonies limited their economic welfare and threatened their cultural integrity. The peripheral population is denied the privilege and responsibility of determining its own political fate. The second argument focused on individuals rather than regions and asserts that culturally distinct identities remain salient among the members of groups subject to a cultural division of labor.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Internal Colonialism: The Celtic Fringe in British National Development, 1536-1966.

It argues that the growth of direct rule \u2013 as indicated by the increasing centralization of state power and the development of policies promoting welfare expenditure and specific cultural policies -- with respect to immigration, same sex marriage, abortion, and so forth -- tends to increase the salience of cultural politics at the expense of its class alternative.<ref>{{cite journal|title=From Class to Culture|doi=10.1086/421357|year=2004|last1=Hechter|first1=Michael|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=400\u2013445}}</ref>\n\n''Alien Rule'' (2013) is about tensions that arise in societies when the ruling authorities are not themselves members of that collectivity, commonly giving rise to nationalist movements.

The first public airing of this work appeared in The Microfoundations of Macrosociology (1983).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249147065|title=Book Review:The Microfoundations of Macrosociology. Michael Hechter}}</ref> In 1987, Hechter wrote Principles of Group Solidarity, which argued that the solidarity of any group is determined by the conjunction of individuals\u2019 dependence on the group for access to collective goods, as well as the group\u2019s capacity to monitor and sanction members for their compliance to corporate obligations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/67/2/544/2232214|title=Principles of Group Solidarity.

This book is also translated into Japanese. Beyond that, Hechter has written extensively on a variety of social phenomena. ''Rational Choice Sociology'' (2019) compiles some of his most important papers on theory, collective action and social order.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/rational-choice-sociology|title=Rational Choice Sociology Essays on Theory, Collective Action and Social Order}}</ref>\n\n=== The value of children and grandchildren ===\nHechter\u2019s interest in rational choice led him to consider the role of values and other motivational states in determining behavior. In this context, he wrote about the value of children and grandchildren. In 1994, he co-authored 'A theory of the value of children\u2019 in Demography. This article explores why people in advanced societies continue to have children even when the cost of so doing far exceeds their economic value to them. The argument hinges on the primacy of the behavioral assumption of uncertainty reduction. The authors review the inadequacies in the prevailing literature based on prevailing normative and rational choice explanations.

The book presented two separate but related arguments. The first was couched at the level of regions. This argument holds that the lack of political sovereignty characteristic of internal colonies limited their economic welfare and threatened their cultural integrity. The peripheral population is denied the privilege and responsibility of determining its own political fate. The second argument focused on individuals rather than regions and asserts that culturally distinct identities remain salient among the members of groups subject to a cultural division of labor.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Internal Colonialism: The Celtic Fringe in British National Development, 1536-1966.

The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}}\n[[File:Palatino (Palatine Hill, Rome).jpg|thumb|The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the [[Palatine Hill]], visibly express the power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.]]\n\nIn 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]]. Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} and the war against [[Jugurtha]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} there was [[Sulla's first civil war|a first civil war]] between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} A [[Third Servile War|major slave revolt]] under [[Spartacus]] followed,{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}}{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}} and then the establishment of the [[first Triumvirate]] with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}}\n[[File:Trajansm\u00e4rkte Forum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial fora]] belongs to a series of ''monumental fora'' (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the [[Colosseum]]),{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} and [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}} This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire and beyond.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=107}} The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to [[Egypt]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}}\n\n[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, approximately {{convert|6.5|e6km2|e6sqmi|1|abbr=off}}<ref>Parker, Philip, \"The Empire Stops Here\". p. 2.</ref> of land surface.]]\n[[File:Foro Romano Forum Romanum Roman Forum (8043630550).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Roman Forum]] are the remains of those buildings that during most of Ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic center of the city and the neuralgic center of all the Roman civilization.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Roman Forum | website=Ancient History Encyclopedia | date=2012-01-18 | url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/26/the-roman-forum/ | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''\"Campidoglio\"'', the Italian name of the hill.\n\n====Administrative and historical subdivisions====\n[[File:Roma - Municipi numerata.png|thumb|The ''municipi'' of Rome]]\n[[File:Piazza della repubblica hdr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Piazza della Repubblica, Rome]]]]\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called ''municipi''  (sing.

Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,<ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]</ref> and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roma, s\u00ec all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml#|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Il Messaggero|date=11 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no serious changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\n[[File:Doria Pamphili 6376.jpg|thumb|left|Stone pines in the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]]]\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452; and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535\u2013552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590\u2013604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.<ref>Richard Krautheimer, Rome, Profile of a City, 312-1308, 2000 p. 65 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the [[reform of 419]].<ref>Bernard Lancon, Rome in Late Antiquity, 2001 p. 14 {{ISBN|0-415-92976-8}}</ref> Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.<ref>Neil Christie, From Constantine to Charlemagne, An Archaeology of Italy 300-800 A.D. 2006 p. 61, {{ISBN|978-1-85928-421-6}}</ref> Novel 36 of Emperor [[Valentinian III]] records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients.

Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the [[Vandals]], and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].<ref>P.

Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}{{clarify|why?|date=March 2014}} Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> stretching over more than 5,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople]] in the fourth century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Other objects of pilgrimage include several catacombs built in imperial times, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the [[Jesuit]] Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, pilgrims in Rome (as well as devout Romans) visit the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (an [[Early Christian]] basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above the [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of [[classical architecture]], developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. Important monuments and sites of ancient Rome include the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious fourth century AD mosaics. Notable later medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next to the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.</ref>\n\n===Statues===\n{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Piazza Navona Rome 04 2016 6503.jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], 1648]]\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents.

Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Catacombs===\n{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}\n[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]], the place where the popes of history are buried]]\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

Lazio).\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball ([[M.

Rome's main railway station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day.

Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the [[Colosseum]]),{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} and [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}} This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire and beyond.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=107}} The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to [[Egypt]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}}\n\n[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, approximately {{convert|6.5|e6km2|e6sqmi|1|abbr=off}}<ref>Parker, Philip, \"The Empire Stops Here\". p. 2.</ref> of land surface.]]\n[[File:Foro Romano Forum Romanum Roman Forum (8043630550).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Roman Forum]] are the remains of those buildings that during most of Ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic center of the city and the neuralgic center of all the Roman civilization.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Roman Forum | website=Ancient History Encyclopedia | date=2012-01-18 | url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/26/the-roman-forum/ | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the [[Medieval commune|commune]], a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Pope [[Lucius II]] fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor [[Pope Eugenius III]]: by this stage the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by [[Arnaldo da Brescia]], a monk who was a religious and social reformer.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by [[Adrianus IV]], which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Under [[Pope Innocent III]], whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a ''Senatore'', who was subject to the pope.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in [[Western Europe]], often acting as arbitrators between Christian [[monarch]]s and exercising additional political powers.<ref name=\"Faus\">Faus, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Gonz\u00e1les. \"''Autoridade da Verdade \u2013 Momentos Obscuros do Magist\u00e9rio Eclesi\u00e1stico''\".

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy.

The municipi were originally 20, then 19,<ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]</ref> and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roma, s\u00ec all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml#|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Il Messaggero|date=11 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no serious changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre.

The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\n[[File:Doria Pamphili 6376.jpg|thumb|left|Stone pines in the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]]]\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pretto | first=Emiliano | title=Rome Post - what's happening in Rome | website=romepost.it | date=2009-06-21 | url=http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621033439/http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm | archive-date=2009-06-21 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in Rome}}\n[[File:San Giovanni in Laterano - Rome.jpg|thumb|right|[[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660-1734]]\n{{bar box\n|title=Religion in Rome (2015), Percentage<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/droma.html |title=Diocese of Roma - Statistics |date=11 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/14_gennaio_21/a-roma-provincia-immigrati-10percento-abitanti-guida-religioni-645b3982-827c-11e3-9102-882f8e7f5a8c.shtml |title=A Roma e Provincia, immigrati il 10% degli abitanti: una guida alle religioni |date=11 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neodemos.info/articoli/roma-citta-italiana-presenza-musulmana/ |title=Roma prima citt\u00e0 italiana per presenza Musulmana |date=11 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visiterome.com/visite_rome_ita/scheda_ghetto_roma.php?ref=5 |title=Gli Ebrei a Roma |date=11 July 2019 |access-date=11 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929131918/http://www.visiterome.com/visite_rome_ita/scheda_ghetto_roma.php?ref=5 |archive-date=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caritasroma.it/2014/01/luoghi-di-incontro-e-di-preghiera-degli-immigrati-a-roma/|title=Luoghi di incontro e di preghiera degli immigrati a Roma |date=14 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/lazio/33-roma/statistiche/popolazione-andamento-demografico/ |title=Popolazione Roma 2001-2018 |date=11 July 2019 }}</ref>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Catholic]]ism|gold|83|82.0}}\n{{bar percent|[[Religious denomination|Other]] or [[Irreligion|non-religious]]|black|9|8.0}}\n{{bar percent|[[Eastern Orthodoxy]]|purple|5|4.0}}\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|4.8|3.8}}\n{{bar percent|[[Protestantism]]|pink|1.8|0.8}}\n{{bar percent|[[Judaism]]|darkblue|1.7|0.7}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|1.4|0.4}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|brown|1.3|0.3}}\n}}\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], and the city has been an important centre of religion and [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople]] in the fourth century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Other objects of pilgrimage include several catacombs built in imperial times, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the [[Jesuit]] Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, pilgrims in Rome (as well as devout Romans) visit the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (an [[Early Christian]] basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above the [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of [[classical architecture]], developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. Important monuments and sites of ancient Rome include the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious fourth century AD mosaics. Notable later medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next to the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.</ref>\n\n===Statues===\n{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Piazza Navona Rome 04 2016 6503.jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], 1648]]\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety.\nRome is home to local rugby union teams such as [[Rugby Roma Olimpic|Rugby Roma]] (founded in 1930 and winner of five Italian championships, the latter in 1999\u20132000), [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]] and [[S.S.

Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009.

The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome therefore hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See,  to the  [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organizations. Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

Nowadays, potential recipients are contacted by government officials well before any public announcement to confirm in writing that they wish to be put forward for an honour, thereby avoiding friction or controversy. However, some have let it be known that the offer was declined, and there have also been occasional leaks from official sources.\n\nA handful of people have accepted and later renounced an honour; these are listed at the end of the article.\n\n==Reasons for rejection==\nPeople may reject state honours for various reasons, among which are:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n*Opposition to specific governmental actions or policy.\n*[[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|Republicanism]] and [[anti-monarchism]].\n*Inappropriate due to the nature of the individual's work or position, or would attract unwanted attention.\n*Personal opinion of pretension.\n*Anti-imperialism or general unwillingness to be associated with the former [[British Empire]] (especially with regards to the Orders of the British Empire, e.g. CBE, OBE and MBE)\n*Inadequate recognition of the individual or a spouse, partner, friend or colleague.\n*The archaic nature of the honour, notably with regards to peerages, knighthoods and baronetcies, or that honours conferring titles are meaningless in a modern society.\n*Feelings that the honours system both reflects and reinforces social class distinctions, and diminishes the chance of a more equal and fairer society.\n*Biased nature of the honours system, or feelings that undeserving people have been decorated.\n*To hide real wealth and business connections from the public realm.\n*Religious reasons\n*Specifically of peerages, to maintain eligibility for election to the House of Commons (essential for any national politician)\n\nSome potential recipients have rejected one honour then accepted another (such as [[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Sir Alfred Hitchcock]]<ref name=Guardian2003>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/dec/22/uk.Whitehall1 |title=Some who turned the offer down |date=22 December 2003 |location=London, UK |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>), or have initially refused an honour then accepted it,{{Who|date=September 2013}} or have accepted one honour then declined another (such as actor [[Robert Morley]] and actress [[Vanessa Redgrave]]<ref name=Independent2003/>), or refused in the hope of another higher distinction ([[Roald Dahl]] refused being decorated as Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE),<ref name=Guardian2003/> allegedly because he wanted a knighthood so that his wife would be entitled to the title \"Lady Dahl\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2012/01/26/roald-dahl-among-hundreds-who-turned-down-queen-s-honours-91466-30203207/2/ |title=Roald Dahl among hundreds who turned down Queen's honours |date=26 January 2012 |website=[[WalesOnline]] |access-date=7 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329025651/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2012/01/26/roald-dahl-among-hundreds-who-turned-down-queen-s-honours-91466-30203207/2/ |archive-date=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince [[John Key]] restored the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] to the pre-2000 British system, [[Richie McCaw]] has repeatedly declined a knighthood after winning the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In December 2011, Prime Minister John Key revealed that he had asked McCaw about the possibility of a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours, but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, \"He made the call that he's still in his playing career and it didn't feel quite right for him, that day where he's no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him.\" No formal offer was ultimately made. McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the [[Order of New Zealand]], which does not bestow a title, in the 2016 New Year Honours.

Situated in what was the [[Roman province]] of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], it was the chief town of the tribe of the [[Capori]]. Though small it was the most important Roman town in what became [[Gallaecia]] during the Roman period, the seat of a ''[[conventus]]'', one of three in Gallaecia, and later became one of the two capitals of Gallaecia, and gave its name to the ''Calla\u00efci Lucenses''. It was centrally situated in a large gold mining region, which during the Roman period was very active. The Conventus Lucensis, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], began at the river [[Navilubio]], and contained 16 peoples; besides the [[Celtici]] and [[Lebuni]]. Though these tribes were not powerful, and their names \"barbarous\" to Roman ears, there were among them 166,000 freemen.<ref>Pliny, iii. 3. s. 4, iv. 20. s. 34</ref> The city stood on one of the upper branches of the Minius (modern [[Minho River|Minho]]), on the road from Bracara to Asturica,<ref>[[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] pp. 424, 430</ref> and had some famous baths, near from the bridge across the Minho.\n\nLucus was the seat of a [[bishopric]] by the later 5th century at the latest and remained an administrative center under the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]], before going into such a decline that the site was found to be deserted in the middle of the 8th century by Bishop Odoario, who set about reviving it. 10th century attempts at rebuilding its ''casas destructas'' (abandoned tenements) suggest that it remained a town only on paper: the seat of a bishopric, administered by a count, from which royal charters were issued. \"Its commercial and industrial role was insignificant\", Richard Fletcher wrote of 11th century Lugo.<ref>Richard A. Fletcher, 1984. ''Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela'' (Oxford University Press) ([http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm on-line text, ch. 1])</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Lugo, like [[Santiago de Compostela]], was a center of pilgrimage, because the cathedral had the special privilege, which it still retains today, of exposing to the public the consecrated host twenty-four hours a day. In the 18th century Lugo was granted the privilege of organizing the fairs of St. Froil\u00e1n. During the Modern Age, Lugo had a certain supremacy, although other nearby towns such as [[Mondo\u00f1edo]] or [[Ribadeo]] disputed it. It was not until the division of the state into provinces in 1833 and the creation of provincial governments that Lugo has become the most important town in the province of Lugo, because of its capital status. This rise has been bolstered by the arrival of the first railroad to the city in 1875.\n\nDuring the 20th century the city continued to grow as the administration and services center of the province. In 1936, when the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] broke out, the city became quickly under the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] control. In the 1970s the city met important reforms, like the development of the Ceao Industrial Area (1979) and the complete restoration of the [[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls]].\n\n[[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo|Infanta Elena]], the elder daughter of [[King Juan Carlos]] and [[Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain]] and fourth in the [[line of succession]] to the Spanish throne, has been duchess of Lugo since 1995.\n\nIn 2000, the recognition of the [[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls]] on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[World Heritage Site]] was an important event in the city.\n\n[[File:Ponte romana de Lugo.jpg|thumb|Old [[Roman empire|Roman]] bridge over the Mi\u00f1o river.]]\n\n==Economy==\nLugo is a city of services. The main activities are commercial, the administration (offices of the autonomous and central Governments) and educational and health services (the recently opened ''Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti'' is the largest in Galicia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.lavozdegalicia.es/default/2010/10/26/03301288081021009363497/Fichero/hospital_lugo20101026.pdf |title=Lucus Augusti, uno de los grandes hospitales de Europa.

Industry is scarce and almost exclusively dedicated to the processing of agricultural products (dairy, meat, timber ...).\n\nThere is a shopping center on the outskirts of the city (As Termas), with an [[Eroski]] hypermarket, cinemas, clothing stores like [[H&M]], [[NewYorker]] or [[Cortefiel]] and many restaurants and fast food chains like [[McDonald's]]. A new shopping center (Abella) has opened in late 2015 and hosts an [[E.Leclerc]] hypermarket, a bowling court, cinemas and a [[McFit]] fitness center.\n\nThe [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] has several faculties at its Lugo Campus, one of the most important being the Faculty of [[Veterinary]] sciences, one of the leading in its field in Spain.\n\nThe daily newspaper {{Interlanguage link multi|El Progreso (Spain)|gl|3=El Progreso (xornal)|lt=El Progreso}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/ |title=elprogreso.galiciae.com |publisher=elprogreso.galiciae.com |date= |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> is published in the city.

The bridge over the Minho is essentially of Roman date, though many repairs over the centuries have effaced its Roman character.\n\nOther sources suggest that the name ''Lucus Augusti'' comes from the Latin word ''Lucus'', which means \"sacred grove\", or \"sacred forest\", as the city was founded on the place of a small grove.\n\nBesides the walls, sights include:\n* the '''[[Lugo Cathedral|Cathedral]]''', dedicated to St. Mary, built about 1129, though the actual main fa\u00e7ade and towers date only from 1769. Its elegant stalls were carved by Francisco Mouro in 1624. This cathedral enjoys the privilege of having the Blessed Sacrament perpetually exposed, a fact commemorated in the armorial bearings of the town.\n* '''Convent and church of St. Francis''', in Gothic style, with remains of the sober cloister. It currently houses the '''Museo Provincial''', which shows a display of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] art and other building of the 18th century\n* '''Church of St. Dominic'''\n* '''City Hall''' (''Casa do Concello'' in Galician), a large Baroque structure with a mid-18th century fa\u00e7ade. Annexed is a clock tower, originally from the 16th century, but rebuilt later.\n* '''Palace of the arts''' (C\u00edrculo das Artes)\n* The '''[[Roman bridge of Lugo|Roman Bridge]]''' over river [[Minho River|Minho]].\n* '''Rosal\u00eda de Castro Park''', a 23 ha park in the city center. It has a small pond in the middle and contains many species of trees, like three [[Sequoia (genus)|sequoias]].\n* '''Museo Interactivo de Historia de Lugo (MIHL)''', an interactive museum about the history of the city, made by [[Nieto Sobejano arquitectos]].\n\nTwo important festivals take place in Lugo:\n* '''Saint Froilan festivity''', which lasts from 4\u201312 October, dedicated to the city's patron saint. It's a [[Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiesta of National Tourist Interest]] and it's very popular to eat [[polbo \u00e1 feira]] in one of the many stands near Rosal\u00eda de Castro park.\n* '''[[Arde Lucus]]''', festival celebrated in the last weeks of June which revives the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[castro culture|castro]] past of the city, and which emerged to commemorate the declaration of the city's Roman wall as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. In its latest editions it has reached nearly half a million visitors.\n\n==Sports==\nThe most popular and known professional team of the city is the basketball team [[CB Breog\u00e1n]], currently playing in [[Liga Espa\u00f1ola de Baloncesto[[Liga ACB]], the first division in [[Spain]], the team has played many seasons in [[Liga ACB]] the top Spanish basketball league. The team occupies the 9th position in the historical ranking of that league.\n\n[[Futsal]] is also popular in Lugo, represented by [[Prone Lugo AD|Azkar Lugo]], which plays in [[ Second Divisi\u00f3n de Futsal|Spanish first division]].\n\nThe football team of Lugo is [[CD Lugo]], currently playing in Spanish [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\nThe fifth stage of the [[2016 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] cycling

Ant.]] pp. 424, 430</ref> and had some famous baths, near from the bridge across the Minho.\n\nLucus was the seat of a [[bishopric]] by the later 5th century at the latest and remained an administrative center under the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]], before going into such a decline that the site was found to be deserted in the middle of the 8th century by Bishop Odoario, who set about reviving it. 10th century attempts at rebuilding its ''casas destructas'' (abandoned tenements) suggest that it remained a town only on paper: the seat of a bishopric, administered by a count, from which royal charters were issued. \"Its commercial and industrial role was insignificant\", Richard Fletcher wrote of 11th century Lugo.<ref>Richard A. Fletcher, 1984. ''Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela'' (Oxford University Press) ([http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm on-line text, ch. 1])</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Lugo, like [[Santiago de Compostela]], was a center of pilgrimage, because the cathedral had the special privilege, which it still retains today, of exposing to the public the consecrated host twenty-four hours a day. In the 18th century Lugo was granted the privilege of organizing the fairs of St. Froil\u00e1n. During the Modern Age, Lugo had a certain supremacy, although other nearby towns such as [[Mondo\u00f1edo]] or [[Ribadeo]] disputed it. It was not until the division of the state into provinces in 1833 and the creation of provincial governments that Lugo has become the most important town in the province of Lugo, because of its capital status. This rise has been bolstered by the arrival of the first railroad to the city in 1875.\n\nDuring the 20th century the city continued to grow as the administration and services center of the province. In 1936, when the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] broke out, the city became quickly under the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] control. In the 1970s the city met important reforms, like the development of the Ceao Industrial Area (1979) and the complete restoration of the [[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls]].\n\n[[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo|Infanta Elena]], the elder daughter of [[King Juan Carlos]] and [[Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain]] and fourth in the [[line of succession]] to the Spanish throne, has been duchess of Lugo since 1995.\n\nIn 2000, the recognition of the [[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls]] on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[World Heritage Site]] was an important event in the city.\n\n[[File:Ponte romana de Lugo.jpg|thumb|Old [[Roman empire|Roman]] bridge over the Mi\u00f1o river.]]\n\n==Economy==\nLugo is a city of services. The main activities are commercial, the administration (offices of the autonomous and central Governments) and educational and health services (the recently opened ''Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti'' is the largest in Galicia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.lavozdegalicia.es/default/2010/10/26/03301288081021009363497/Fichero/hospital_lugo20101026.pdf |title=Lucus Augusti, uno de los grandes hospitales de Europa. La Voz de Galicia |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The steady increase of population of the city has coincided with the development of the major economic sectors of the municipality. Industry is scarce and almost exclusively dedicated to the processing of agricultural products (dairy, meat, timber ...).\n\nThere is a shopping center on the outskirts of the city (As Termas), with an [[Eroski]] hypermarket, cinemas, clothing stores like [[H&M]], [[NewYorker]] or [[Cortefiel]] and many restaurants and fast food chains like [[McDonald's]]. A new shopping center (Abella) has opened in late 2015 and hosts an [[E.Leclerc]] hypermarket, a bowling court, cinemas and a [[McFit]] fitness center.\n\nThe [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] has several faculties at its Lugo Campus, one of the most important being the Faculty of [[Veterinary]] sciences, one of the leading in its field in Spain.\n\nThe daily newspaper {{Interlanguage link multi|El Progreso (Spain)|gl|3=El Progreso (xornal)|lt=El Progreso}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/ |title=elprogreso.galiciae.com |publisher=elprogreso.galiciae.com |date= |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> is published in the city. It's the most read newspaper in the [[province of Lugo]].\n\nThere is a private [[aerodrome]] in the nearby town of Rozas, owned by the Spanish [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Ministry of Defence]] and administered by Real Aero Club de Lugo. In 2011, the Ministry of Defence transferred the installations to [[Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial|INTA]], Spain's [[space agency]], in order to convert it into a center of aeronautical research,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/nova/82213.html |title=El Progreso - El aer\u00f3dromo de Rozas ser\u00e1 un centro nacional de investigaci\u00f3n aeron\u00e1utica |publisher=Elprogreso.galiciae.com |date=27 March 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Muralla.Lugo.Galicia.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls of Lugo]]]]Lugo is the only city in the world to be surrounded by completely intact [[Roman Walls of Lugo|Roman walls]], which reach a height of 10 to 15 metres along a 2117&nbsp;m circuit ringed with 71 towers. The walk along the top is continuous round the circuit, and features ten gates. These 3rd century walls are protected by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The bridge over the Minho is essentially of Roman date, though many repairs over the centuries have effaced its Roman character.\n\nOther sources suggest that the name ''Lucus Augusti'' comes from the Latin word ''Lucus'', which means \"sacred grove\", or \"sacred forest\", as the city was founded on the place of a small grove.\n\nBesides the walls, sights include:\n* the '''[[Lugo Cathedral|Cathedral]]''', dedicated to St. Mary, built about 1129, though the actual main fa\u00e7ade and towers date only from 1769. Its elegant stalls were carved by Francisco Mouro in 1624. This cathedral enjoys the privilege of having the Blessed Sacrament perpetually exposed, a fact commemorated in the armorial bearings of the town.\n* '''Convent and church of St. Francis''', in Gothic style, with remains of the sober cloister. It currently houses the '''Museo Provincial''', which shows a display of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] art and other building of the 18th century\n* '''Church of St. Dominic'''\n* '''City Hall''' (''Casa do Concello'' in Galician), a large Baroque structure with a mid-18th century fa\u00e7ade. Annexed is a clock tower, originally from the 16th century, but rebuilt later.\n* '''Palace of the arts''' (C\u00edrculo das Artes)\n* The '''[[Roman bridge of Lugo|Roman Bridge]]''' over river [[Minho River|Minho]].\n* '''Rosal\u00eda de Castro Park''', a 23 ha park in the city center. It has a small pond in the middle and contains many species of trees, like three [[Sequoia (genus)|sequoias]].\n* '''Museo Interactivo de Historia de Lugo (MIHL)''', an interactive museum about the history of the city, made by [[Nieto Sobejano arquitectos]].\n\nTwo important festivals take place in Lugo:\n* '''Saint Froilan festivity''', which lasts from 4\u201312 October, dedicated to the city's patron saint. It's a [[Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiesta of National Tourist Interest]] and it's very popular to eat [[polbo \u00e1 feira]] in one of the many stands near Rosal\u00eda de Castro park.\n* '''[[Arde Lucus]]''', festival celebrated in the last weeks of June which revives the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[castro culture|castro]] past of the city, and which emerged to commemorate the declaration of the city's Roman wall as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. In its latest editions it has reached nearly half a million visitors.\n\n==Sports==\nThe most popular and known professional team of the city is the basketball team [[CB Breog\u00e1n]], currently playing in [[Liga Espa\u00f1ola de Baloncesto[[Liga ACB]], the first division in [[Spain]], the team has played many seasons in [[Liga ACB]] the top Spanish basketball league. The team occupies the 9th position in the historical ranking of that league.\n\n[[Futsal]] is also popular in Lugo, represented by [[Prone Lugo AD|Azkar Lugo]], which plays in [[ Second Divisi\u00f3n de Futsal|Spanish first division]].\n\nThe football team of Lugo is [[CD Lugo]], currently playing in Spanish [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\nThe fifth stage of the [[2016 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] cycling race finished in Lugo.<ref name=\"lavuelta-route\">{{cite web|title=2016 Route|url=http://www.lavuelta.com/la-vuelta/2016/us/overall-route.html|work=[[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]|publisher=Unipublic|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Spain}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\nLugo is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209141620/http://www.lugo.es/cs/Satellite?c=Spark_SecNivel3&cid=1194254258363&color=Rojo&idContenido=1194429736555&idioma=gl&pagename=Spark/Spark_SecNivel3/CLPlantSecNivel3Detalle&tipoContenido=Spark_Novas&tipoLetra=Texto1|title=Lugo celebrar\u00e1 un D\u00eda de China con un hermanamiento de sus murallas y con la ciudad de Qinhuangdao|date=2009-12-09|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> <ref>{{Citation|title=Lugo|date=2020-04-23|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lugo&oldid=125431486|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Ferrol]], Spain\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Dinan]], France\n*{{flagicon|POR}} [[Viana do Castelo]], Portugal\n*{{flagicon|PRC}} [[Qinhuangdao]], China\n*{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diocese of Lugo]]\n* [[List of Spanish cities]]\n* [[List of municipalities in Lugo]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Catholic}}\n* {{SmithDGRG}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Lugo}}\n*{{Commons-inline|Lugo}}\n\n{{Galician_cities}}\n{{Lugo (province)}}\n{{Capitals of Provinces in Spain}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Lugo| ]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in the Province of Lugo]]\n[[Category:13 BC establishments]]\n[[Category:University towns in Spain]]\n", "name_user": "Saurom Lamderth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTwin towns \u2013 sister cities", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugo"}

This investment in and development of intangibles such as software is a core contributor to value creation and economic growth for companies in the digital economy<ref name=\":2\" />. In early 2000, companies have started to substantially increase the amount of capital advocated to intangibles such as branding, design and, technology rather than in hardware, machinery or property<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/blogs/ib-knowledge/rise-intangible-economy-how-capitalism-without-capital-fostering-inequality/|title=The rise of the intangible economy: how capitalism without capital is fostering inequality|website=Imperial College Business School|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n==== Mobility of business functions ====\nAdvancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have significantly reduced the cost associated with the organization and coordination of complex activities over a long period. Long businesses are increasingly able to manage their global operations on an integrated basis from a central location that may be removed geographically from both the locations in which the operations are carried out and the locations in which their suppliers or customers are located. Consequently, it allowed to expand access to remote markets and thus, provided an opportunity to provide those goods and services across the borders<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n=== Reliance on Data ===\nThe Digital economy relies on personal data collection. In 1995, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]] (Directive 95/46/CE, art.2), defined data as \u201cany information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to his identification number or to information which is specific to him\u201d.\u00a0 At that time, this regulation emerged in response to the need to integrate the European market. By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0123|title=L_2006376FR.01003601.xml|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>. For this reason, [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradford|first=Anu|title=The Brussels effect|publisher=Oxford Press University|year=2019|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chap. 5|pages=131\u2013169}}</ref>. \n\nDue to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising.

It occurs when the value of a product or service to\u00a0 the user increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service. For instance, [[WhatsApp]] provides a free communication platform with friends and contacts. The utility to use it relies on the fact that a substantial part of or friends and colleagues are already users.

This feature allows to explain why these platforms can propose freely their content, with customers on one side and the software developers or advertisers on the other.

Due to the immaterial nature of digital activities, these digital multinational enterprises (MNEs) are extremely mobile, which allows them to optimize tax evasion. They can carry out high volumes of sales from a tax jurisdiction. Concretely, governments face MNE fiscal optimization from companies locating their activity in the countries where tax is the lowest. On the other hand, companies can undergo double-taxation for the same activity or be confronted with legal and tax vagueness.

Even if the question had already come up earlier in 1990 and was brought up again later in 2010<ref name=\":6\" />, it emerged at a sensitive moment in the post-crisis of 2008, used as a catalyst for action <ref>{{Cite book|last=Hatzopoulos|first=Vassilis|title=\"La justification des atteintes aux libert\u00e9s de circulation: cadre m\u00e9thodologique et sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s mat\u00e9rielles|publisher=College of Europe|year=2013|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>.

This gave a new dimension to the Market. The proposal for the DSM had been made under the strategy of the Commission entitled \u201c[[Digital Agenda for Europe]]\u201d in the political guidelines of the second Barroso Commission and pointed out the need to eliminate barriers in order to implement the European Digital Market as an attempt to relaunch the [[European Single Market|Single Market.]] This strategy was similar to the one used for the [[European Single Market|Internal Market]] in 1985 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=M\u0103rcu\u0163|first=M.|title=Crystalizing the EU digital policy: An exploration into the digital single market|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and focused on one of the weaknesses of this latter namely the fragmentation of the national digital market. Building on the Monti report, the communication 'Towards a Single Market Act' detailed 50 proposals to reform the SM by the end of 2012. But the DSM was only adopted in 2015 and the proposal for a directive of the [[European Parliament]] and the Council was made in September 2016. \n\nThe '''DSM''' is presented as a key priority in the economy of Union, even if there were several attempts to deepen the integration, there are still obstacles remaining. The creation of the DSM constitutes, a catalyst to resolve several issues, and was supposed to have a widespread multiplier effect throughout sectors across the EU.<ref name=\":8\" /> The EU Commission had to face several obstacles. The commission acts in a way to deeply transform the SM. However, the EC lack of political support to enhance the impact of its decision<ref name=\":7\" />The issue of the low salience was a causal factor explaining the limits of the commission\u2019s commitment to reform the single market. Even though the member states approved the DSM, and the definition for the DSM was accepted by European institutions as a key priority, only one proposal was adopted at the end of 2012. Despite being a priority in the SMA I & II, legislative initiatives failed due to the high cost of implementation measures. Also, there were its potential \u2018blockbuster for economic gains\u2019\u00a0<ref name=\":7\" /> and the protest of citizens against sovereign debt countries rescues and bail-out banks. The slow adoption of the proposal is partly due to [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]\u2019 protectionist temptations after the economic crisis. Each state wanted to put forward its preferences and legislation about concerning this field. \n\nWith regard to [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), the Commission adopted various initiatives with no meaningful coordination. The more pervasive the digital ecosystem becomes, the more sector-specific regulatory framework should be merged into general regimes. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renda|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=Will the DSM Strategy Spur Innovation ?|url=|journal=Intereconomics|volume=52|issue=4|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1007/s10272-017-0674-7|hdl=10419/172813}}</ref>\n\nEven if the [[European Commission|Commission]] used the crisis as a window of opportunity, it did not allow to go deeper and further in implementing a high transformation of the Single Market (SM). The crisis context pushed the political actors to move forward to better manage the crisis, but it does not permit to fully implement the DSM. \n\n==== Current challenges ====\nOne of the key priorities of the EU is to guarantee fair competition. Yet, within the Digital Market, the competition seems to be distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benhamou|first=Fran\u00e7oise|date=February 2018|title=Quelle r\u00e9gulation face aux plateformes num\u00e9riques?|journal=Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=75\u201378|doi=10.3917/rindu1.181.0075}}</ref> The more network effects are exerted, the higher the barriers to entry (difficulty for a new entrant to enter the market and compete) in the hub market.

It seems difficult for the regulators to sanction them, in the way that the [[Big Tech|GAFA]] provides jobs and services worldwide.\n\n==== Challenges for the regulator ====\nThe problems remain plural for the regulators. They need to identify and define platforms. There is no possibility to regulate exante to limit the size of the platform. The European Commission can sanction afterwards when the platform abuse already of its dominant position. Moreover, Member-states lack coordination, and may be independent of the regulator, who can\u2019t have a global vision of the market. Tax evasion of digital MNEs has become a growing concern for most of the European governments, including the European Commission. Attracting foreign investment is less and less seen as a relevant reason to implement tax cuts. Aside from the fiscal revenue shortfall, this issue has taken a political turn in recent years since people and politicians feel that, in a time of financial crisis, these highly profitable firms do not contribute to the national effort. <ref name=\":4\" />\n<br />\n\n=== The main strength within the EU digital policy ===\n'''Digital Market''' is characterized by its heterogeneity <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=GAGLIO|first=Cyrielle|first2=Sarah|last2=GUILLIOU|date=2018|title=L'Europe num\u00e9rique.

The EU sanctions cartels\u2019 behavior and examines mergers in order to preserve competition and protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the market. Within the digital market, the merger is the rule to build a digital giant, it\u2019s can be a brake to construct digital European giant. Indeed, in a way, the EU regulator may handicap giant to build themselves, and do not inject as well money in the sector. Moreover, the EU could be a leader in regulation to protect people working in the digital sector or for the digital sector (such as [[Uber]]\u2019s driver, a case recently in France), which could a window of opportunity. However, the EU needs to be cautious with its regulation in order to create barriers at the market entry. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== European Commission versus Google =====\nThe [[European Commission]] (EC) decided to fine [[Google]] \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google Shopping. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanckenburg|first=K.|date=2018|title=Google search abuses dominant position to illegally favour Google Shopping: an economic review of the EU decision|url=|journal=Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211\u2013224|doi=10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0020}}</ref>The EC aimed to pave the way to concurrent who suffers from its abuse of dominant position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-google-strategy-first-big-court-test/|title=Vestager's Google strategy faces its first big court test|last=Van Dorpe|first=Simon |date=2020-02-03|website=POLITICO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Moreover, it proved that the strategy of the EC does work and may fine companies at a great rate. \n\n===== Junker Commission =====\nThe '''Digital Economy''' has been a concern for the Commission concern since the 1st [[Barroso Commission|Barroso]] Commission. Yet, it is only under the Junker that the strategy of the DSM was adopted on the 6th May 2015 as it was ranked as the second priority out of the '''10 priorities''' for the new Commission\u2019s mandate. Throughout this document, the DSM emphasized 3 policy pillars: \n\n# improving access to digital goods and services\n# an environment where digital networks and services can prosper\n# digital as a driver of growth. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/factsheets-commissions-10-priorities_en|title=Factsheets on the Commission's 10 priorities|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nAs a key priority for the newly President-elect [[Juncker Commission|Juncker]], he made [[Andrus Ansip]], the vice-president of the Commission, in charge of the DSM. The decision to approach the DSM from a different point of view is also because the digital space is in constant evolution with the growing importance of online platform and the change of market share<ref name=\":8\" />. The DSM was a priority because of its economic importance; the total of EU e-commerce reached 240 billion \u20ac in 2011, and out of that 44 billion were cross-border trade between member state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALVAREZ Le\u00f3n|first=LUIS F.|date=2018|title=A Blueprint for Market Construction? Spatial Data Infrastructure(s), Interoperability, and the EU Digital Single Market|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=92|pages=45-57}}</ref>\n\n=== Within the new commission ===\nIn 2020, the digital economy continues to be a top priority for the EC, and belongs once again to the agenda of the Commission president. [[Frans Timmermans]] has been designed to be the vice president in charge of one of the '''six priorities of the EC''', called \u201c'''A Europe fit for digital age'''\u201d. The priority is elaborated as follow, EC is working on a digital transformation that will benefit to everyone . These goals are set to open up new opportunities for businesses, to boost the development of trustworthy technology, foster an open and democratic society, enable a vibrant and sustainable economy, and help fight climate change and achieve the green transition. The strategy of digital economy is included in a wider strategy for the future of Europe. However, as explained on the EC\u2019s website, the aim to become a global role model for the digital economy fit within the EU\u2019s goals for decades, as it is the aim in the environmental field. However, the EU had to review its aim in this field, and becomes a 'Leadiator'.  It\u2019s possible that in the '''Digital Economy,''' the EU has to behave and evolves in the same way, because the champions of the digital sector aren't European, which creates a handicap in the way the EU refrain from legislating. The EU cannot restrict the offer to its citizens, because digital leader aren\u2019t mainly Europeans. One objective of the single market is to make available the better quality at the better price, and propose a better choice to its citizens. \n\n== Conclusion ==\nAs explained earlier, the digital economy is based on '''computing technologies.''' More and more business result in the connection around the world. It\u2019s referred to as a '''new type of economy''' that emerges. The rapid spread of ICT all around the world has led to the development of a new kind of product and services, that changes the way we are doing business today. The '''Digital Economy''' represents today '''15% of the global world GDP'''. It\u2019s relying on '''personal data''', which has been regulated by the EU\u2019s directive of 1995, which had the goal to integrate EU within the Digital market. [[Digital Single Market]] has been for long a priority for the EU and has  beneficiated of the 2007 crisis as a window of opportunity to act. However, we see how the mandate of the EC is thin, to the heterogeneity of the market, and the fact that the EU has to act ex-post. As a result, Member States '''lack of coordination'''. The goals of the Single Market concerning consumers, is to offer a panel of choice at a better price. Yet, the champions of the '''Digital market aren\u2019t Europeans'''. Due to the network effect, barriers to European businesses that want to enter within the market, the barriers remain even higher. '''Dominant position''' harbored by '''US big tech platforms''' do not give a wide possibility of manoeuver combined with the volatility of the market. \n<br />\n\n== Critics/debate ==\n\n=== Rise of intangible capitalism ===\nThe digital economy is also qualified as \"intangible capitalism\"f which fosters inequality and social division. In 2017, Haskel and Westlake published \u201ccapitalism without capital\u201d which raises concerns about policymakers\u2019 inability to tailor from the transition of the traditional economy to the New Economy based on intangible assets. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies have been investing more in \u2018intangibles\u2019 such as branding, design, and technology than they have in machinery, hardware or property.\n\nBusinesses such as Uber don\u2019t own cars, they own software and data. Coffee bars and gyms rely on branding to help them stand out from the crowd. Pharmaceutical companies have vast budgets for marketing as well as research and development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs opposed to the traditional production where the marginal cost of production decreases after the first unit produced which doesn\u2019t apply to the software. Once the first unit is produced such as data, insurance, e-books, even movies, the rest of the production is virtually free. As the proportion of the world\u2019s economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model keeps getting larger, it has implications for a wide range of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital|title=Not enough people are paying attention to this economic trend|last=Gates|first=Bill|website=gatesnotes.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe intangibility of assets may widen the gap between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals enterprises (MNEs). On the one hand, the current bank system struggles to value and monitor immaterial assets. In the old days, when a company went bankrupt, banks could recover their money by selling the physical assets such as buildings, machinery, etc. Yet, if the intangible assets drop, those assets. can\u2019t be sold easily as they as the value of the company goes down. As a result, SMEs are more reliant on venture capital which is different than bank financing. The easier access to resources allow MNEs to benefit from synergies of the intangible assets. For instance, In creating the iPod, Apple combined MP3 technology with licensing agreements, record labels, and design expertise to produce a winning product. This ability to combine technologies and then scale up to help these companies to increase their dominant position on the market.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Exploitation of labour forces ===\n\n==== Expansion of Global value chains ====\nThe digital economy has accelerated the spread of global value chains in which Multinationals enterprises (MNEs) integrate their worldwide operations.<ref name=OECD2017/> These advances, coupled with liberalization of trade policy and reduction in transportation costs, have expanded the ability of businesses in all sectors to take advantage of global value chains in which production processes can be geographically dispersed in locations around the world to take advantage of the features of local markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> It\u2019s easier for firms to implement their activities where there are low wages and to coordinate their activities from countries with high wages.\n\n==== Bypassing labor laws ====\nThe rise of online platforms raises concerns in terms of legal questions about social security and labor law. Since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there is an increase in '[[Uberisation|uberization]]' of work. As within a company that gives its name to this phenomenon, workers are defined as \u2018independent workers\u2019 (with temporary, off-site, autonomous contracts) which challenges the application of labor and occupational health and safety law. As a result, online platforms encourage the flexibilization of jobs and a higher volatility of the labor market rather than on traditional companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garben|first=Sacha|title=The regulatory challenge of occupational safety and health in the online platform economy|url=|journal=International Social Security Review|year=2019|volume=72|issue=3|pages=95\u2013112|doi=10.1111/issr.12215}}</ref> \u2018[[Gig economy]]\u2019 companies such as [[Deliveroo]] and [[Uber]] hire drivers which are self-employed and sign a contract with the digital platform while the way they work is much regular to a regular employee statute.

This investment in and development of intangibles such as software is a core contributor to value creation and economic growth for companies in the digital economy<ref name=\":2\" />. In early 2000, companies have started to substantially increase the amount of capital advocated to intangibles such as branding, design and, technology rather than in hardware, machinery or property<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/blogs/ib-knowledge/rise-intangible-economy-how-capitalism-without-capital-fostering-inequality/|title=The rise of the intangible economy: how capitalism without capital is fostering inequality|website=Imperial College Business School|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n==== Mobility of business functions ====\nAdvancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have significantly reduced the cost associated with the organization and coordination of complex activities over a long period. Long businesses are increasingly able to manage their global operations on an integrated basis from a central location that may be removed geographically from both the locations in which the operations are carried out and the locations in which their suppliers or customers are located. Consequently, it allowed to expand access to remote markets and thus, provided an opportunity to provide those goods and services across the borders<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n=== Reliance on Data ===\nThe Digital economy relies on personal data collection. In 1995, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]] (Directive 95/46/CE, art.2), defined data as \u201cany information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to his identification number or to information which is specific to him\u201d.\u00a0 At that time, this regulation emerged in response to the need to integrate the European market. By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0123|title=L_2006376FR.01003601.xml|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>. For this reason, [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradford|first=Anu|title=The Brussels effect|publisher=Oxford Press University|year=2019|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chap. 5|pages=131\u2013169}}</ref>. \n\nDue to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising. Algorithms classify, reference and prioritize the preferences of individuals to better predict their behavior.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategie.gouv.fr/debats/economie-numerique-fiscalite|title=Economie num\u00e9rique et fiscalit\u00e9|website=www.strategie.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nVia free access to platforms in exchange for the collection of personal data, they make the content non-rival. Thus, the intangibility of content tends to give a collective natural aspect to this information accessible to everyone, to benefit public good which would create a digital public space<ref name=\":3\" />. The McKinsey Global Institute Report (McKinsey Global Institute report, 2014) notes five broad ways in which leveraging big data can create value for businesses:\n\n# Creating transparency by making data more easily accessible in a promptly on time to stakeholders with the capacity to use the data.\n# Managing performance by enabling experimentation to analyze variability in performance and understand its root causes.\n# Segmenting populations to customize products and services.\n# Improve decision making by replacing or supporting human decision making with automated algorithms.\n# Improve the development of new business models, products, and services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Global flows in digital age: how trade, finance, people and data connect the world economy|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Globalization/Global%20flows%20in%20a%20digital%20age/Global_flows_in_a_digital_age_Full_report%20March_2015.ashx|journal=McKinsey Global Institue Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Boston Consulting Group estimated that personal data collected in Europe was worth 315 billion euros <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite report|last=|first=|date=February 26, 2015|title=Taxation and the Digital economy: a survey of theoretical models|publisher=France Strat\u00e9gie|orig-year=Final report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/ficalite_du_numerique_9_mars_13_h.pdf|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n=== Network effet ===\nThis new economic model is based on the 'Network effect'. It occurs when the value of a product or service to\u00a0 the user increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service. For instance, [[WhatsApp]] provides a free communication platform with friends and contacts. The utility to use it relies on the fact that a substantial part of or friends and colleagues are already users. The attractivity relies here on the snowball effect <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/01/02/how-to-harness-the-power-of-network-effects/|title=Council Post: How To Harness The Power Of Network Effects|last=Reddy|first=Nirmala|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Multi-sided market ===\nThe Digital market is a market can be labeled as a \u2018multi-sided\u2019 market. The notion developed by French [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] laureate [[Jean Tirole]] is based on the idea that platforms are \u2018two-sided\u2019. This feature allows to explain why these platforms can propose freely their content, with customers on one side and the software developers or advertisers on the other. On a market where multiple groups of persons interact through platforms as intermediaries, the decisions of each group affect the outcome of the other group of persons through a positive or negative externality <ref>{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/upshot/how-jean-tiroles-work-helps-explain-the-internet-economy.html|title=How Jean Tirole's Work Helps Explain the Internet Economy|date=2014-10-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>. When the users spend time on a page or click on links, this creates a positive externality for the advertiser displaying a banner there.

Due to the immaterial nature of digital activities, these digital multinational enterprises (MNEs) are extremely mobile, which allows them to optimize tax evasion. They can carry out high volumes of sales from a tax jurisdiction. Concretely, governments face MNE fiscal optimization from companies locating their activity in the countries where tax is the lowest. On the other hand, companies can undergo double-taxation for the same activity or be confronted with legal and tax vagueness.

The crisis opened a window for opportunities to place the Single Market upfront in the European agenda and was aimed to resolve two issues: financial supervision and economic coordination <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Camis\u00e3o|first=Isabel|last2=Guimar\u00e3es|first2=Maria H.|date=March 2017|title=The Commission, the Single Market and the Crisis: The Limits of Purposeful Opportunism|journal=Journal of Common Market Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=223\u2013239|doi=10.1111/jcms.12464}}</ref>. This gave a new dimension to the Market. The proposal for the DSM had been made under the strategy of the Commission entitled \u201c[[Digital Agenda for Europe]]\u201d in the political guidelines of the second Barroso Commission and pointed out the need to eliminate barriers in order to implement the European Digital Market as an attempt to relaunch the [[European Single Market|Single Market.]] This strategy was similar to the one used for the [[European Single Market|Internal Market]] in 1985 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=M\u0103rcu\u0163|first=M.|title=Crystalizing the EU digital policy: An exploration into the digital single market|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and focused on one of the weaknesses of this latter namely the fragmentation of the national digital market. Building on the Monti report, the communication 'Towards a Single Market Act' detailed 50 proposals to reform the SM by the end of 2012. But the DSM was only adopted in 2015 and the proposal for a directive of the [[European Parliament]] and the Council was made in September 2016. \n\nThe '''DSM''' is presented as a key priority in the economy of Union, even if there were several attempts to deepen the integration, there are still obstacles remaining. The creation of the DSM constitutes, a catalyst to resolve several issues, and was supposed to have a widespread multiplier effect throughout sectors across the EU.<ref name=\":8\" /> The EU Commission had to face several obstacles. The commission acts in a way to deeply transform the SM. However, the EC lack of political support to enhance the impact of its decision<ref name=\":7\" />The issue of the low salience was a causal factor explaining the limits of the commission\u2019s commitment to reform the single market. Even though the member states approved the DSM, and the definition for the DSM was accepted by European institutions as a key priority, only one proposal was adopted at the end of 2012. Despite being a priority in the SMA I & II, legislative initiatives failed due to the high cost of implementation measures. Also, there were its potential \u2018blockbuster for economic gains\u2019\u00a0<ref name=\":7\" /> and the protest of citizens against sovereign debt countries rescues and bail-out banks. The slow adoption of the proposal is partly due to [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]\u2019 protectionist temptations after the economic crisis. Each state wanted to put forward its preferences and legislation about concerning this field. \n\nWith regard to [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), the Commission adopted various initiatives with no meaningful coordination. The more pervasive the digital ecosystem becomes, the more sector-specific regulatory framework should be merged into general regimes. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renda|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=Will the DSM Strategy Spur Innovation ?|url=|journal=Intereconomics|volume=52|issue=4|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1007/s10272-017-0674-7|hdl=10419/172813}}</ref>\n\nEven if the [[European Commission|Commission]] used the crisis as a window of opportunity, it did not allow to go deeper and further in implementing a high transformation of the Single Market (SM). The crisis context pushed the political actors to move forward to better manage the crisis, but it does not permit to fully implement the DSM. \n\n==== Current challenges ====\nOne of the key priorities of the EU is to guarantee fair competition. Yet, within the Digital Market, the competition seems to be distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benhamou|first=Fran\u00e7oise|date=February 2018|title=Quelle r\u00e9gulation face aux plateformes num\u00e9riques?|journal=Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=75\u201378|doi=10.3917/rindu1.181.0075}}</ref> The more network effects are exerted, the higher the barriers to entry (difficulty for a new entrant to enter the market and compete) in the hub market.

It seems difficult for the regulators to sanction them, in the way that the [[Big Tech|GAFA]] provides jobs and services worldwide.\n\n==== Challenges for the regulator ====\nThe problems remain plural for the regulators. They need to identify and define platforms. There is no possibility to regulate exante to limit the size of the platform. The European Commission can sanction afterwards when the platform abuse already of its dominant position. Moreover, Member-states lack coordination, and may be independent of the regulator, who can\u2019t have a global vision of the market. Tax evasion of digital MNEs has become a growing concern for most of the European governments, including the European Commission. Attracting foreign investment is less and less seen as a relevant reason to implement tax cuts. Aside from the fiscal revenue shortfall, this issue has taken a political turn in recent years since people and politicians feel that, in a time of financial crisis, these highly profitable firms do not contribute to the national effort. <ref name=\":4\" />\n<br />\n\n=== The main strength within the EU digital policy ===\n'''Digital Market''' is characterized by its heterogeneity <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=GAGLIO|first=Cyrielle|first2=Sarah|last2=GUILLIOU|date=2018|title=L'Europe num\u00e9rique.

The EU sanctions cartels\u2019 behavior and examines mergers in order to preserve competition and protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the market. Within the digital market, the merger is the rule to build a digital giant, it\u2019s can be a brake to construct digital European giant. Indeed, in a way, the EU regulator may handicap giant to build themselves, and do not inject as well money in the sector. Moreover, the EU could be a leader in regulation to protect people working in the digital sector or for the digital sector (such as [[Uber]]\u2019s driver, a case recently in France), which could a window of opportunity. However, the EU needs to be cautious with its regulation in order to create barriers at the market entry. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== European Commission versus Google =====\nThe [[European Commission]] (EC) decided to fine [[Google]] \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google Shopping. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanckenburg|first=K.|date=2018|title=Google search abuses dominant position to illegally favour Google Shopping: an economic review of the EU decision|url=|journal=Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211\u2013224|doi=10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0020}}</ref>The EC aimed to pave the way to concurrent who suffers from its abuse of dominant position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-google-strategy-first-big-court-test/|title=Vestager's Google strategy faces its first big court test|last=Van Dorpe|first=Simon |date=2020-02-03|website=POLITICO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Moreover, it proved that the strategy of the EC does work and may fine companies at a great rate. \n\n===== Junker Commission =====\nThe '''Digital Economy''' has been a concern for the Commission concern since the 1st [[Barroso Commission|Barroso]] Commission. Yet, it is only under the Junker that the strategy of the DSM was adopted on the 6th May 2015 as it was ranked as the second priority out of the '''10 priorities''' for the new Commission\u2019s mandate. Throughout this document, the DSM emphasized 3 policy pillars: \n\n# improving access to digital goods and services\n# an environment where digital networks and services can prosper\n# digital as a driver of growth. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/factsheets-commissions-10-priorities_en|title=Factsheets on the Commission's 10 priorities|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nAs a key priority for the newly President-elect [[Juncker Commission|Juncker]], he made [[Andrus Ansip]], the vice-president of the Commission, in charge of the DSM. The decision to approach the DSM from a different point of view is also because the digital space is in constant evolution with the growing importance of online platform and the change of market share<ref name=\":8\" />. The DSM was a priority because of its economic importance; the total of EU e-commerce reached 240 billion \u20ac in 2011, and out of that 44 billion were cross-border trade between member state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALVAREZ Le\u00f3n|first=LUIS F.|date=2018|title=A Blueprint for Market Construction? Spatial Data Infrastructure(s), Interoperability, and the EU Digital Single Market|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=92|pages=45-57}}</ref>\n\n=== Within the new commission ===\nIn 2020, the digital economy continues to be a top priority for the EC, and belongs once again to the agenda of the Commission president. [[Frans Timmermans]] has been designed to be the vice president in charge of one of the '''six priorities of the EC''', called \u201c'''A Europe fit for digital age'''\u201d. The priority is elaborated as follow, EC is working on a digital transformation that will benefit to everyone . These goals are set to open up new opportunities for businesses, to boost the development of trustworthy technology, foster an open and democratic society, enable a vibrant and sustainable economy, and help fight climate change and achieve the green transition. The strategy of digital economy is included in a wider strategy for the future of Europe. However, as explained on the EC\u2019s website, the aim to become a global role model for the digital economy fit within the EU\u2019s goals for decades, as it is the aim in the environmental field. However, the EU had to review its aim in this field, and becomes a 'Leadiator'.  It\u2019s possible that in the '''Digital Economy,''' the EU has to behave and evolves in the same way, because the champions of the digital sector aren't European, which creates a handicap in the way the EU refrain from legislating. The EU cannot restrict the offer to its citizens, because digital leader aren\u2019t mainly Europeans. One objective of the single market is to make available the better quality at the better price, and propose a better choice to its citizens. \n\n== Conclusion ==\nAs explained earlier, the digital economy is based on '''computing technologies.''' More and more business result in the connection around the world. It\u2019s referred to as a '''new type of economy''' that emerges. The rapid spread of ICT all around the world has lead to the development of a new kind of product and services, that changes the way we are doing business today. The '''Digital Economy''' represents today '''15% of the global world GDP'''. It\u2019s relying on '''personal data''', which has been regulated by the EU\u2019s directive of 1995, which had the goal to integrate EU within the Digital market. [[Digital Single Market]] has been for long a priority for the EU and has  beneficiated of the 2007 crisis as a window of opportunity to act. However, we see how the mandate of the EC is thin, to the heterogeneity of the market, and the fact that the EU has to act ex-post. As a result, Member States '''lack of coordination'''. The goals of the Single Market concerning consumers, is to offer a panel of choice at a better price. Yet, the champions of the '''Digital market aren\u2019t Europeans'''. Due to the network effect, barriers to European businesses that want to enter within the market, the barriers remain even higher. '''Dominant position''' harbored by '''US big tech platforms''' do not give a wide possibility of manoeuver combined with the volatility of the market. \n<br />\n\n== Critics/debate ==\n\n=== Rise of intangible capitalism ===\nThe digital economy is also qualified as \"intangible capitalism\"f which fosters inequality and social division. In 2017, Haskel and Westlake published \u201ccapitalism without capital\u201d which raises concerns about policymakers\u2019 inability to tailor from the transition of the traditional economy to the New Economy based on intangible assets. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies have been investing more in \u2018intangibles\u2019 such as branding, design, and technology than they have in machinery, hardware or property.\n\nBusinesses such as Uber don\u2019t own cars, they own software and data. Coffee bars and gyms rely on branding to help them stand out from the crowd. Pharmaceutical companies have vast budgets for marketing as well as research and development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs opposed to the traditional production where the marginal cost of production decreases after the first unit produced which doesn\u2019t apply to the software. Once the first unit is produced such as data, insurance, e-books, even movies, the rest of the production is virtually free. As the proportion of the world\u2019s economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model keeps getting larger, it has implications for a wide range of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital|title=Not enough people are paying attention to this economic trend|last=Gates|first=Bill|website=gatesnotes.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe intangibility of assets may widen the gap between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals enterprises (MNEs). On the one hand, the current bank system struggles to value and monitor immaterial assets. In the old days, when a company went bankrupt, banks could recover their money by selling the physical assets such as buildings, machinery, etc. Yet, if the intangible assets drop, those assets. can\u2019t be sold easily as they as the value of the company goes down. As a result, SMEs are more reliant on venture capital which is different than bank financing. The easier access to resources allow MNEs to benefit from synergies of the intangible assets. For instance, In creating the iPod, Apple combined MP3 technology with licensing agreements, record labels, and design expertise to produce a winning product. This ability to combine technologies and then scale up to help these companies to increase their dominant position on the market.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Exploitation of labour forces ===\n\n==== Expansion of Global value chains ====\nThe digital economy has accelerated the spread of global value chains in which Multinationals enterprises (MNEs) integrate their worldwide operations.<ref name=OECD2017/> These advances, coupled with liberalization of trade policy and reduction in transportation costs, have expanded the ability of businesses in all sectors to take advantage of global value chains in which production processes can be geographically dispersed in locations around the world to take advantage of the features of local markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> It\u2019s easier for firms to implement their activities where there are low wages and to coordinate their activities from countries with high wages.\n\n==== Bypassing labor laws ====\nThe rise of online platforms raises concerns in terms of legal questions about social security and labor law. Since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there is an increase in '[[Uberisation|uberization]]' of work. As within a company that gives its name to this phenomenon, workers are defined as \u2018independent workers\u2019 (with temporary, off-site, autonomous contracts) which challenges the application of labor and occupational health and safety law. As a result, online platforms encourage the flexibilization of jobs and a higher volatility of the labor market rather than on traditional companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garben|first=Sacha|title=The regulatory challenge of occupational safety and health in the online platform economy|url=|journal=International Social Security Review|year=2019|volume=72|issue=3|pages=95\u2013112|doi=10.1111/issr.12215}}</ref> \u2018[[Gig economy]]\u2019 companies such as [[Deliveroo]] and [[Uber]] hire drivers which are self-employed and sign a contract with the digital platform while the way they work is much regular to a regular employee statute. Yet, for the first time in March 2020, France\u2019s top court (Cour de Cassation) ruling acknowledged that a Uber driver could not qualify as a \u2018self-employed\u2019 contractor because he could not build his clientele or set his prices, establishing a relation of a subordinate of the company. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-court-idUSKBN20R23F|title=Top French court deals blow to Uber by giving driver 'employee' status|date=2020-03-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Intensification of the global competition for human resources ====\nDigital platforms rely on '[[deep learning]]' to scale up their algorithm\u2019s capacity. The human-powered content labeling industry is constantly growing as companies seek to harness data for AI training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ai-focus-idUSKCN1SC01T|title=Facebook 'labels' posts by hand, posing privacy questions|date=2019-05-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref> These practices have raised concerns concerning the low-income revenue and health-related issues of these independent workers. For instance, digital companies such as [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube (channel)|Youtube]] use \u2018content monitor\u2019-contractors who work as outside monitors hired by a professional services company subcontractor- to monitor social media to remove any inappropriate content. Thus, the job consists of watching and listening to disturbing posts that can be violent or sexual. In January 2020, through its subcontractor services society, Facebook and Youtube have asked the \u2018content moderators\u2019 to sign a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) disclosure after alleged cases of mental disorders witnessed on workers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51245616|title=Social media moderators asked to sign PTSD forms|date=2020-01-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Petrenko Sergei.
