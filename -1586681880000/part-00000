Hungary's first [[King of Hungary|king]], [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]], took up [[Western Christianity]], although his mother [[Sarolt]] was baptized into [[Eastern Christianity]]. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] took place and, as a result, first [[Lutheranism]] and then soon afterwards [[Calvinism]] became the religion of almost the entire population. Protestants composed some 85-90% of the entire population, more than a half of the Hungarian population being part of the Calvinist confessing Reformed Church and a quarter of lutheran confessing Evangelical Church.<ref>{{cite book |last1=P\u00e1llfy |first1=G\u00e9za |title=Searching for faith: a change of religion in Hungary |date=2007 |publisher=Akad\u00e9mia Kiad\u00f3 |location=Budapest |page=370}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, however, the Catholic Habsburg Kings and [[Jesuits]] led a successful campaign of [[Counter-Reformation]] among the Hungarians. The Jesuits not only founded educational institutions, including [[P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny Catholic University]], the oldest university that still exists in Hungary, but also organized missions in order to promote popular piety.\n\nUsing both political and apologetic efforts, most of the High Nobility composing the Diet was already predominantly Catholic by 1640's, a process consolidated as the new reconquered estates were granted to the converted aristocracy, who supported in Counter-Reformation. Despite this, the lower nobility, the town burghers and the common people still retained a largely Protestant \u2013 specially Calvinist \u2013 identity, opposing the catholic German-likeness of the Habsburg courtly politics. Allied with the Constitutional Rights enforced by the Nobility and the military pressure of the Protestant [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] on the eastern border, Catholic Counter-Reformation achieved partial results compared to the other Habsburg-controlled possessions, like Bohemia and Austria, where Catholicism was restored to the status of the sole religion of the realm.\n\nSome of the eastern parts of the country, especially around [[Debrecen]] (nicknamed \"the Calvinist Rome\"), still have significant Protestant communities. The [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] is the second-largest church in Hungary with 1,153,442 adherents as of 2011.<ref name=1920-2011/> The church has 1,249 congregations, 27 presbyteries, and 1,550 ministers.

It was introduced by Saxon settlers in the early 16th century, but after its brief efflorescence, the introduction of the Reformed Church and the Counter-Reformation made it almost non-existent amongst Hungarians up to the late 17th century. Later it was re-introduced through inward migration by Saxons and Slovaks. Today, the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary]] is a small minority in Hungary today. Despite its relatively small number of adherents, it had a strong power and influence in internal politics since Hungary's independence from the strongly Catholic Habsburg Empire.\n\nThe proportion of all Protestantism in Hungary has decreased from around 27% in the early 20th century to about 16% in the early 21st century.<ref name=1920-2011/> [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Hungary]] has been the religion mainly of certain national minorities in the country, notably [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]]. Hungary has also been the home of a sizable [[Armenian Catholic]] community. They worship according to the [[Armenian Rite]], but they have united with the Catholic Church under the primacy of the Pope. Some of the Armenians in Hungary are adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was legally recognized in Hungary in June 1988 and its first meetinghouse in the country was dedicated in October of the following year by President [[Thomas S.

Hungary's first [[King of Hungary|king]], [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]], took up [[Western Christianity]], although his mother [[Sarolt]] was baptized into [[Eastern Christianity]]. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] took place and, as a result, first [[Lutheranism]] and then soon afterwards [[Calvinism]] became the religion of almost the entire population. Protestants composed some 85-90% of the entire population, more than a half of the Hungarian population being part of the Calvinist confessing Reformed Church and a quarter of lutheran confessing Evangelical Church.<ref>{{cite book |last1=P\u00e1llfy |first1=G\u00e9za |title=Searching for faith: a change of religion in Hungary |date=2007 |publisher=Akad\u00e9mia Kiad\u00f3 |location=Budapest |page=370}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, however, the Catholic Habsburg Kings and [[Jesuits]] led a successful campaign of [[Counter-Reformation]] among the Hungarians. The Jesuits not only founded educational institutions, including [[P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny Catholic University]], the oldest university that still exists in Hungary, but also organized missions in order to promote popular piety.\n\nUsing both political and apologetic efforts, most of the High Nobility composing the Diet was already predominantly Catholic by 1640's, a process consolidated as the new reconquered estates were granted to the converted aristocracy, who supported in Counter-Reformation. Despite this, the lower nobility, the town burghers and the common people still retained a largely Protestant \u2013 specially Calvinist \u2013 identity, opposing the catholic German-likeness of the Habsburg courtly politics. Allied with the Constitutional Rights enforced by the Nobility and the military pressure of the Protestant [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] on the eastern border, Catholic Counter-Reformation achieved partial results compared to the other Habsburg-controlled possessions, like Bohemia and Austria, where Catholicism was restored to the status of the sole religion of the realm.\n\nSome of the eastern parts of the country, especially around [[Debrecen]] (nicknamed \"the Calvinist Rome\"), still have significant Protestant communities. The [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] is the second-largest church in Hungary with 1,153,442 adherents as of 2011.<ref name=1920-2011/> The church has 1,249 congregations, 27 presbyteries, and 1,550 ministers.

It was introduced by Saxon settlers in the early 16th century, but after its brief efflorescence, the introduction of the Reformed Church and the Counter-Reformation made it almost non-existent amongst Hungarians up to the late 17th century. Later it was re-introduced through inward migration by Saxons and Slovaks. Today, the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary]] is a small minority in Hungary today. Despite its relatively small number of adherents, it had a strong power and influence in internal politics since Hungary's independence from the strongly Catholic Habsburg Empire.\n\nThe proportion of all Protestantism in Hungary has decreased from around 27% in the early 20th century to about 16% in the early 21st century.<ref name=1920-2011/> [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Hungary]] has been the religion mainly of certain national minorities in the country, notably [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]]. Hungary has also been the home of a sizable [[Armenian Catholic]] community. They worship according to the [[Armenian Rite]], but they have united with the Catholic Church under the primacy of the Pope. Some of the Armenians in Hungary are adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was legally recognized in Hungary in June 1988 and its first meetinghouse in the country was dedicated in October of the following year by President [[Thomas S.

More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\n\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring [[German cuisine|Germany]].\n\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm |title=World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption 2009 |publisher=Finfacts.ie |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |title=Consommation annuelle moyenne d'alcool par habitant, Catholic Ministry of Health |work=sante.gouv.fr |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112184246/https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German.

In addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tns-ilres.com/cms/Home |title=TNS ILRES \u2013 Home |publisher=Tns-ilres.com |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> is conducted in French.\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations ([[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[RTL Group]]). It is also the uplink home of [[SES S.A.|SES]], carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\n\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual

More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\n\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring [[German cuisine|Germany]].\n\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm |title=World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption 2009 |publisher=Finfacts.ie |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |title=Consommation annuelle moyenne d'alcool par habitant, Catholic Ministry of Health |work=sante.gouv.fr |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112184246/https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu |title=Luxemburger Wort |work=Wort.lu |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tns-ilres.com/cms/Home |title=TNS ILRES \u2013 Home |publisher=Tns-ilres.com |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> is conducted in French.\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations ([[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[RTL Group]]). It is also the uplink home of [[SES S.A.|SES]], carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\n\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/pays_cine/index.php |title=Luxembourg, a film country |publisher=Eu2005.lu |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421235925/http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/pays_cine/index.php |archivedate=21 April 2010 }}</ref> There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.filmfund.lu/the-film-fund/mission/index.php |title=Film Fund Luxembourg |publisher=En.filmfund.lu |date= |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cna.public.lu/film/infos-pratiques/index-professionnels/societes-production-studios/index.html |title=Luxembourgish Film Production Companies |publisher=Cna.public.lu |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nLuxembourg won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2014 in the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Animated Short Films]] category with ''[[Mr Hublot]]''.\n\n=== Notable Luxembourgers ===\n* [[List of Luxembourgers]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Luxembourg}}\n* [[Outline of Luxembourg]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}} \n* {{Cite book |language=French |first=Jean-Marie |last=Kreins |year=2003 |title=Histoire du Luxembourg |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]] |location=Paris |isbn=978-2-13-053852-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Thewes |first=Guy |title=Les gouvernements du Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg depuis 1848 |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/download/gouvernements_1848_2.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2007 |edition=\u00c9dition limit\u00e9e |date=July 2003 |publisher=Service Information et Presse |location=Luxembourg City |language=French |isbn=2-87999-118-8}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195440/http://www.mediacom.public.lu/comm_elec/plan_action_TIC-mars2009/Plan_d_action_TIC_-_LU2009.pdf Plan d'action national luxembourgeois en mati\u00e8re de TIC et de haut-d\u00e9bit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195440/http://www.mediacom.public.lu/comm_elec/plan_action_TIC-mars2009/Plan_d_action_TIC_-_LU2009.pdf CEE- Europe's Digital Competitiveness Report \u2013Volume 2: i2010 \u2013ICT Country Profiles- page 40-41]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195439/http://www.luxembourgforict.lu/en/news/2009/10/Lu-Cix/Lucix_EN.pdf Inauguration of LU-CIX]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002854/http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/culture_mouvement/index.php Art and Culture in Luxembourg]\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Luxembourg|collapsible=collapsed}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190605215808/http://luxembourg.public.lu/en/ The Official Portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120829212536/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/luxembourg.htm Luxembourg] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|lu|Luxembourg}}\n* {{Curlie|Regional/Europe/Luxembourg}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17548470 Luxembourg profile] from the [[BBC News]]\n* [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Luxembourg_2009.pdf ''Luxembourg's Constitution of 1868 with Amendments through 2009'', English Translation 2012]\n* {{wikiatlas|Luxembourg}}\n\n{{Luxembourg topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n| list = \n{{Countries of Europe}}\n{{EU members}}\n{{European Economic Area (EEA)}}\n{{Council of Europe members}}\n{{Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}\n{{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Benelux countries}}\n{{La Francophonie}}\n{{Monarchies|collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Luxembourg| ]]\n[[Category:Benelux|*]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:French-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:German-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Member states of NATO]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Council of Europe]]\n[[Category:Member states of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Union for the Mediterranean]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:NUTS 1 statistical regions of the European Union]]\n[[Category:NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1815]]\n[[Category:States of the German Confederation]]\n[[Category:Western European countries]]\n[[Category:Countries in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "1.187.185.212", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Hhgjj)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg"}
