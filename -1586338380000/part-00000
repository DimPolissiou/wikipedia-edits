The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world.

An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]].

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; increased to 12 hours by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable, as well as through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries, barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

One of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]], his use of procedure to out manoeuvre his opponents was unusual for the period, and as a result, he was respected, rather than admired.  \n\nDescribed as 'a true revolutionary', he led the opposition to arbitrary rule under first [[James I of England|James I]], then [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]]. His leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the Parliamentary cause, and his death from cancer in December 1643 a major blow.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=278}}  \n\nHis father died when he was seven months old, and Pym was brought up by his stepfather, [[Anthony_Rous_(1555-1620)|Sir Anthony Rous]], inheriting his [[Puritan]] views, and deep opposition to the [[Arminianism in the Church of England|reforms]] of [[William_Laud|Archbishop Laud]]. He was also a leading member of the [[Providence Island Company]], an attempt to establish a Puritan colony in Central America.\n\nOriginally buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], after the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], his body was dumped in a pit at nearby [[St_Margaret's,_Westminster|St Margaret's]], along with other Parliamentary leaders.   \n\n==Biography==\nAlexander Pym (1547\u20131585) was a member of the minor gentry, from [[Brymore School|Brymore, Somerset]], who became a successful lawyer in [[London]], where John was born in 1584. His father died seven months later, and his mother, Philippa Colles (died 1620), married a wealthy Cornish landowner, [[Anthony_Rous_(1555-1620)|Sir Anthony Rous]]. A close friend and [[executor]] of Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir Anthony instilled in his step-son a dislike of [[Habsburg_Spain|Spain]], [[Puritanism]], and fierce opposition to [[Catholicism]] and [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]].{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=221}}\n\nThe Rous were a large and close-knit family, who often wed relatives and friends. In May 1604, Pym married Anne Hooke, a daughter of Barbara Rous and John Hooke, and aunt of the scientist [[Robert Hooke]]. Before her death in 1620, they had seven children, of whom four survived into adulthood; Philippa (1604\u20131654), [[Sir_Charles_Pym,_1st_Baronet|Charles]] (1615\u20131671), Dorothy (1617\u20131661), and Catherine.{{sfn|MacDonald |1969|p=43}}\n\n==Career==\nPym was educated at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], then known as Broadgates, and a place renowned for its 'advanced Protestantism.'{{sfn|McGee|2004|p=406}} As legal knowledge was then considered part of an education, he moved to the [[Middle Temple]] in 1602. He does not appear to have formally graduated from either, although he made a number of lifelong friends, the most important being [[William_Whitaker_(MP)|William Whitaker]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1969|p=42}} \n\nIn June 1605, he was appointed collector of taxes for the [[Exchequer]] in [[Hampshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], and [[Wiltshire]]; this gave him a broader range of connections than many contemporaries, who were often confined to family or county networks. Whitaker's father had been [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Westbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Westbury, Wiltshire]], and in 1621, Pym was elected for the nearby seat of [[Calne (UK Parliament constituency)|Calne]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John Pym|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/john-pym|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Francis, 4th Earl of Bedford by Henry Bone.jpg|left|thumb|Pym's patron and political ally, the [[Francis_Russell,_4th_Earl_of_Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], 1587\u20131641]]\nHis diary shows he viewed Parliamentary legislation as a whole, not just issues of interest to himself; combined with an ability to explain them clearly, it led to his appointment to numerous committees. Since direct criticism of the king was considered treason, the only way to express opposition was by attacking his advisors, using the process of [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeachment]]. Pym argued it was for the [[House_of_Commons_of_England|Commons]] to decide guilt or innocence, leaving the [[House_of_Lords|Lords]] only to determine the penalty; this would become significant in his future Parliamentary career.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}}     \n\nEven in an era when it was common, he was notable for his anti-Catholicism, and opposition to alleged [[Arminianism_in_the_Church_of_England|Catholic practices in the Church of England]]. Genuinely felt, there were a number of reasons for this; first, close links between 17th century religion and politics meant alterations in one were often viewed as implying alterations in the other. Second, like many contemporaries, it reflected concerns [[James I of England|James]] was failing to support [[Protestantism|Protestant Europe]], and his [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|own son-in-law]], when it was [[Thirty_Years'_War|under attack]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1969|pp=45\u201350}}  \n\nAfter the dissolution of Parliament in 1621, Pym was arrested, and brought before the [[Privy_Council_of_England|Privy Council]], but released in August 1622. In 1624, he was elected for [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]], a seat controlled by [[Francis_Russell,_4th_Earl_of_Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], which he retained for the rest of his career.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} He was one of the prime movers behind an attempt to impeach the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1626, an action that led to Parliament being dissolved. Only Buckingham's assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt, while Pym supported the presentation of the [[Petition of Right]] to [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] in 1628.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nPym, his stepbrother, [[Francis Rous]], and [[John Hampden]], also led the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]], two clergymen who published [[sermons]] supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]. Although censured by Parliament for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]]. In 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640.{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} \n\nHe became treasurer of the [[Providence Island Company]] in 1630; this increasingly consumed his time, and in 1639, he relinquished his Exchequer position. His role connected him to a small group of devout Presbyterians, many of whom became leaders of the Parliamentary opposition in 1642. They included Henry Darley, [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], [[William Waller]], and [[Robert_Greville,_2nd_Baron_Brooke|Lord Brooke]].{{sfn|Duinen|2007|p=531}}\n\n==Leader of the Parliamentary opposition; 1640 to 1643==\n===Background===\n[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Hampden]]; Pym's colleague, and one of the [[Five Members]]]]\nHistorians like [[Timothy_J._G._Harris|Tim Harris]] argue that with the exception of a few extremists, there was general consensus prior to 1640 that attempts to rule without Parliament had gone too far. After the [[Grand Remonstrance]] in November 1641, [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional monarchists]] like Clarendon switched sides, arguing Parliament now wanted too much.{{sfn|Harris|2014|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nWhere Pym differed from Clarendon, and many of his own colleagues, was in understanding far earlier than almost anyone else Charles would not keep his commitments. Even while negotiating with Parliamentary moderates, he and [[Henrietta_Maria_of_France|Henrietta Maria]] made it clear to foreign ambassadors concessions were temporary, and they intended to retrieve them, by force if needed. The Irish Catholic rebels also claimed his approval for their actions, an assertion given weight by previous attempts to use them against his Scottish opponents, and initial refusal to condemn the rebellion.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=26\u201327}} \n\nHowever, Pym's understanding of Charles' character was hampered by the reality he was essential to a stable government and society. Regardless of religion or political belief, in 1642 the vast majority believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was divinely mandated; where they disagreed was what 'well-ordered' meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. [[Cavalier|Royalists]] generally supported a [[Church of England]] governed by [[Episcopal polity|bishops]], appointed by, and answerable to, the king; [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.{{sfn|Macloed|2009|pp=5\u201319 passim}}\n\n[[Puritan]] was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different sects. [[Presbyterian_polity|Presbyterians]] were the most prominent, and included leaders like Pym and [[John_Hampden|John Hampden]], but there were many others, such as [[Congregational_church|Congregationalists]], often grouped together as [[Independent_(religion)|Independents]]. Close links between religion and politics added further complexity; one reason for  opposition to bishops was their presence in the [[House of Lords]], where they often blocked Parliamentary legislation. Their removal by the [[Clergy_Act_1640|1640 Clergy Act]] was a major step along the road to war.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=31}}  \n\nMost Presbyterians were political conservatives, who believed in a limited electorate, and wanted to keep the Church of England, but as a reformed, Presbyterian body, similar to the [[Church of Scotland]]. 1640 England was a structured, socially conservative, and largely peaceful society; the devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years War]] in Europe meant many wanted to avoid war at any cost.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=253}}\n\n===The road to war===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Trial of Strafford (State 2) cropped.jpg|left|thumb|The trial of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|the Earl of Strafford]], March 1641]]\nFollowing defeat in the first of the [[Bishops Wars]], Charles recalled Parliament in April 1640; when the [[Short Parliament]] refused to vote taxes without concessions, he dissolved it after only three weeks. However, the humiliating [[Treaty_of_Ripon|terms]] imposed by the Scots after a second defeat forced him to hold fresh elections in November; Pym became unofficial leader of the opposition.{{sfn|Jessup|2013|p=25}} \n\nShortly after the [[Long Parliament]] assembled, it was presented with the [[Root and Branch petition]]; signed by 15,000 Londoners, it demanded England follow the Scots, and expel bishops.{{sfn|Rees|2016|p=2}} This reflected widespread concerns about 'Catholic practices', or [[Arminianism in the Church of England]], given weight by Charles' apparent willingness to make war on the Protestant Scots, but not assist his nephew [[Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine|Charles Louis]] regain his [[Electoral_Palatinate|hereditary lands]].{{efn|A perspective summarised by Pym's stepbrother Francis in 1641; \"For Arminianism is the span of a Papist, and if you mark it well, you shall see an Arminian reaching to a Papist, a Papist to a Jesuit, a Jesuit to the Pope, and the other to the King of Spain. And having kindled fire in our neighbours, they now seek to set on flame this kingdom also.\"}} Many feared Charles was about to sign an alliance with Spain, a view shared by experienced diplomatic observers like [[Republic_of_Venice|Venice]], and even France.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1955|p=248}}  \n\nWhile Pym sought to end Charles' arbitrary and autocratic rule, support for the institution of monarchy required him to adopt the traditional technique of attacking his 'evil counsellors.' In December, Laud was impeached, and held in the [[Tower of London]]; this followed in May 1641 by the execution of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]].{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nThe Commons also passed a series of constitutional reforms, including the [[Triennial Acts]], abolition of the [[Star Chamber]], and an end to levying taxes without Parliament's consent. Voting as a block, the bishops ensured all these were rejected by the Lords.{{sfn|Rees|2016|pp=7\u20138}} In June 1641, Pym responded with the [[Clergy_Act_1640|Bishops Exclusion Bill]], which was rejected by the Lords. The outbreak of the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1641|Irish Rebellion]] in October brought matters to a head; both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, but neither trusted the other with their control.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=4}} \n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|right|Victorian re-imagining of the arrest the [[Five Members]], January 1642]]\nPym helped draft the [[Grand Remonstrance]], presented to Charles on 1 December 1641; unrest culminated in 23 to 29 December with widespread riots in [[Westminster]], led by the London apprentices.

One of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]], his use of procedure to out manoeuvre his opponents was unusual for the period, and as a result, he was respected, rather than admired.  \n\nDescribed as 'a true revolutionary', he led the opposition to arbitrary rule under first [[James I of England|James I]], then [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]]. His leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the Parliamentary cause, and his death from cancer in December 1643 a major blow.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=278}}  \n\nHis father died when he was seven months old, and Pym was brought up by his stepfather, [[Anthony_Rous_(1555-1620)|Sir Anthony Rous]], inheriting his [[Puritan]] views, and deep opposition to the [[Arminianism in the Church of England|reforms]] of [[William_Laud|Archbishop Laud]]. He was also a leading member of the [[Providence Island Company]], an attempt to establish a Puritan colony in Central America.\n\nOriginally buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], after the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], his body was dumped in a pit at nearby [[St_Margaret's,_Westminster|St Margaret's]], along with other Parliamentary leaders.   \n\n==Biography==\nAlexander Pym (1547-1585) was a member of the minor gentry, from [[Brymore School|Brymore, Somerset]], who became a successful lawyer in [[London]], where John was born in 1584. His father died seven months later, and his mother, Philippa Colles (died 1620), married a wealthy Cornish landowner, [[Anthony_Rous_(1555-1620)|Sir Anthony Rous]]. A close friend and [[executor]] of Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir Anthony instilled in his step-son a dislike of [[Habsburg_Spain|Spain]], [[Puritanism]], and fierce opposition to [[Catholicism]] and [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]].{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=221}}\n\nThe Rous were a large and close-knit family, who often wed relatives and friends. In May 1604, Pym married Anne Hooke, a daughter of Barbara Rous and John Hooke, and aunt of the scientist [[Robert Hooke]]. Before her death in 1620, they had seven children, of whom four survived into adulthood; Philippa (1604-1654), [[Sir_Charles_Pym,_1st_Baronet|Charles]] (1615-1671), Dorothy (1617-1661), and Catherine.{{sfn|MacDonald |1969|p=43}}\n\n==Career==\nPym was educated at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], then known as Broadgates, and a place renowned for its 'advanced Protestantism.'{{sfn|McGee|2004|p=406}} As legal knowledge was then considered part of an education, he moved to the [[Middle Temple]] in 1602. He does not appear to have formally graduated from either, although he made a number of lifelong friends, the most important being [[William_Whitaker_(MP)|William Whitaker]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1969|p=42}} \n\nIn June 1605, he was appointed collector of taxes for the [[Exchequer]] in [[Hampshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], and [[Wiltshire]]; this gave him a broader range of connections than many contemporaries, who were often confined to family or county networks. Whitaker's father had been [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Westbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Westbury, Wiltshire]], and in 1621, Pym was elected for the nearby seat of [[Calne (UK Parliament constituency)|Calne]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John Pym|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/john-pym|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Francis, 4th Earl of Bedford by Henry Bone.jpg|left|thumb|Pym's patron and political ally, the [[Francis_Russell,_4th_Earl_of_Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], 1587-1641]]\nHis diary shows he viewed Parliamentary legislation as a whole, not just issues of interest to himself; combined with an ability to explain them clearly, it led to his appointment to numerous committees. Since direct criticism of the king was considered treason, the only way to express opposition was by attacking his advisors, using the process of [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeachment]]. Pym argued it was for the [[House_of_Commons_of_England|Commons]] to decide guilt or innocence, leaving the [[House_of_Lords|Lords]] only to determine the penalty; this would become significant in his future Parliamentary career.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}}     \n\nEven in an era when it was common, he was notable for his anti-Catholicism, and opposition to alleged [[Arminianism_in_the_Church_of_England|Catholic practices in the Church of England]]. Genuinely felt, there were a number of reasons for this; first, close links between 17th century religion and politics meant alterations in one were often viewed as implying alterations in the other. Second, like many contemporaries, it reflected concerns [[James I of England|James]] was failing to support [[Protestantism|Protestant Europe]], and his [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|own son-in-law]], when it was [[Thirty_Years'_War|under attack]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1969|pp=45-50}}  \n\nAfter the dissolution of Parliament in 1621, Pym was arrested, and brought before the [[Privy_Council_of_England|Privy Council]], but released in August 1622. In 1624, he was elected for [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]], a seat controlled by [[Francis_Russell,_4th_Earl_of_Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], which he retained for the rest of his career.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} He was one of the prime movers behind an attempt to impeach the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1626, an action that led to Parliament being dissolved. Only Buckingham's assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt, while Pym supported the presentation of the [[Petition of Right]] to [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] in 1628.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nPym, his stepbrother, [[Francis Rous]], and [[John Hampden]], also led the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]], two clergymen who published [[sermons]] supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]. Although censured by Parliament for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]]. In 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640.{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} \n\nHe became treasurer of the [[Providence Island Company]] in 1630; this increasingly consumed his time, and in 1639, he relinquished his Exchequer position. His role connected him to a small group of devout Presbyterians, many of whom became leaders of the Parliamentary opposition in 1642. They included Henry Darley, [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], [[William Waller]], and [[Robert_Greville,_2nd_Baron_Brooke|Lord Brooke]].{{sfn|Duinen|2007|p=531}}\n\n==Leader of the Parliamentary opposition; 1640 to 1643==\n===Background===\n[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Hampden]]; Pym's colleague, and one of the [[Five Members]]]]\nHistorians like [[Timothy_J._G._Harris|Tim Harris]] argue that with the exception of a few extremists, there was general consensus prior to 1640 that attempts to rule without Parliament had gone too far. After the [[Grand Remonstrance]] in November 1641, [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional monarchists]] like Clarendon switched sides, arguing Parliament now wanted too much.{{sfn|Harris|2014|pp=457-458}}\n\nWhere Pym differed from Clarendon, and many of his own colleagues, was in understanding far earlier than almost anyone else Charles would not keep his commitments. Even while negotiating with Parliamentary moderates, he and [[Henrietta_Maria_of_France|Henrietta Maria]] made it clear to foreign ambassadors concessions were temporary, and they intended to retrieve them, by force if needed. The Irish Catholic rebels also claimed his approval for their actions, an assertion given weight by previous attempts to use them against his Scottish opponents, and initial refusal to condemn the rebellion.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=26-27}} \n\nHowever, Pym's understanding of Charles' character was hampered by the reality he was essential to a stable government and society. Regardless of religion or political belief, in 1642 the vast majority believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was divinely mandated; where they disagreed was what 'well-ordered' meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. [[Cavalier|Royalists]] generally supported a [[Church of England]] governed by [[Episcopal polity|bishops]], appointed by, and answerable to, the king; [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.{{sfn|Macloed|2009|pp=5\u201319 passim}}\n\n[[Puritan]] was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different sects. [[Presbyterian_polity|Presbyterians]] were the most prominent, and included leaders like Pym and [[John_Hampden|John Hampden]], but there were many others, such as [[Congregational_church|Congregationalists]], often grouped together as [[Independent_(religion)|Independents]]. Close links between religion and politics added further complexity; one reason for  opposition to bishops was their presence in the [[House of Lords]], where they often blocked Parliamentary legislation. Their removal by the [[Clergy_Act_1640|1640 Clergy Act]] was a major step along the road to war.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=31}}  \n\nMost Presbyterians were political conservatives, who believed in a limited electorate, and wanted to keep the Church of England, but as a reformed, Presbyterian body, similar to the [[Church of Scotland]]. 1640 England was a structured, socially conservative, and largely peaceful society; the devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years War]] in Europe meant many wanted to avoid war at any cost.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=253}}\n\n===The road to war===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Trial of Strafford (State 2) cropped.jpg|left|thumb|The trial of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|the Earl of Strafford]], March 1641]]\nFollowing defeat in the first of the [[Bishops Wars]], Charles recalled Parliament in April 1640; when the [[Short Parliament]] refused to vote taxes without concessions, he dissolved it after only three weeks. However, the humiliating [[Treaty_of_Ripon|terms]] imposed by the Scots after a second defeat forced him to hold fresh elections in November; Pym became unofficial leader of the opposition.{{sfn|Jessup|2013|p=25}} \n\nShortly after the [[Long Parliament]] assembled, it was presented with the [[Root and Branch petition]]; signed by 15,000 Londoners, it demanded England follow the Scots, and expel bishops.{{sfn|Rees|2016|p=2}} This reflected widespread concerns about 'Catholic practices', or [[Arminianism in the Church of England]], given weight by Charles' apparent willingness to make war on the Protestant Scots, but not assist his nephew [[Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine|Charles Louis]] regain his [[Electoral_Palatinate|hereditary lands]].{{efn|A perspective summarised by Pym's stepbrother Francis in 1641; \"For Arminianism is the span of a Papist, and if you mark it well, you shall see an Arminian reaching to a Papist, a Papist to a Jesuit, a Jesuit to the Pope, and the other to the King of Spain. And having kindled fire in our neighbours, they now seek to set on flame this kingdom also.\"}} Many feared Charles was about to sign an alliance with Spain, a view shared by experienced diplomatic observers like [[Republic_of_Venice|Venice]], and even France.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1955|p=248}}  \n\nWhile Pym sought to end Charles' arbitrary and autocratic rule, support for the institution of monarchy required him to adopt the traditional technique of attacking his 'evil counsellors.' In December, Laud was impeached, and held in the [[Tower of London]]; this followed in May 1641 by the execution of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]].{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nThe Commons also passed a series of constitutional reforms, including the [[Triennial Acts]], abolition of the [[Star Chamber]], and an end to levying taxes without Parliament's consent. Voting as a block, the bishops ensured all these were rejected by the Lords.{{sfn|Rees|2016|pp=7-8}} In June 1641, Pym responded with the [[Clergy_Act_1640|Bishops Exclusion Bill]], which was rejected by the Lords. The outbreak of the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1641|Irish Rebellion]] in October brought matters to a head; both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, but neither trusted the other with their control.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=4}} \n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|right|Victorian re-imagining of the arrest the [[Five Members]], January 1642]]\nPym helped draft the [[Grand Remonstrance]], presented to Charles on 1 December 1641; unrest culminated in 23 to 29 December with widespread riots in [[Westminster]], led by the London apprentices.

It was the last major manifestation of a Welsh independence movement before the incorporation of Wales into England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]].<ref>Gwyn A. Williams, ''When Was Wales? A History of the Welsh'' (London, 1991), p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nand territory under direct Royal rule. Richard eliminated his rivals and took their land or gave it to his favourites. As he did so, he raised an entire class of Welsh people to fill the new posts created in his new [[fiefdom]]s. For these people, the final years of the reign of Richard II were full of opportunities. To the English magnates, it was a further sign that Richard was dangerously out of control.\n\nIn 1399, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], heir to the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], returned to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from [[Ireland]] to Wales to deal with Bolingbroke but he was arrested by [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], as he was on his way from [[Conwy Castle]] to meet Bolingbroke at [[Flint Castle]] supposedly to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Richard was imprisoned at [[Chester, England|Chester]] before being taken to London. Parliament quickly made Henry Bolingbroke [[Regent]] and then King. Richard died in [[Pontefract Castle]], shortly after the failed [[Epiphany Rising]] of English nobles in January 1400, but his death was not generally known for some time. In Wales, people like [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh had generally supported King Richard,<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/guide/ch10_revolt_of_owain_glyndwr.shtml|title=BBC Wales  \u2013 History \u2013 Themes  \u2013 Chapter 10: The revolt of Owain Glyndwr|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> who had succeeded his father, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], as [[Prince of Wales]]. With Richard removed, the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people became more limited. Many Welsh people seem to have been uncertain where this left them and their future.\n\nFor some time, supporters of the deposed king remained at large. On 10 January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester in support of the [[Epiphany Rising]]. An atmosphere of disorder was building along the Anglo-Welsh border.\n\n===The dispute between Owain Glynd\u0175r and de Grey===\nThe revolt reportedly began as an argument with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s English neighbour.<ref name=bbc/> Successive holders of the title [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] of Dyffryn Clwyd were [[England|English]] landowners in Wales. Glynd\u0175r had been engaged in a long-running land dispute with them.{{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=70}} He seems to have appealed to Parliament (though which one is not clear) to resolve the issue with the courts under King Richard finding in his favour. [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] \u2014 loyal to the new king \u2014 then appears to have used his influence to have that decision overturned. Owain Glynd\u0175r possibly had his appeal rejected.{{sfn | Tout| 1900|p=9}} Another story is that de Grey deliberately withheld a Royal Summons for Glynd\u0175r to join the new king\u2019s Scottish campaign of August 1400. Technically, as a tenant-in-chief to the English King, Glynd\u0175r was obliged to provide troops, as he had done in the past.{{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=75}}{{sfn | Tout| 1900|p=10}} By not responding to the hidden summons he seems, perhaps unwittingly, to have incurred Henry's wrath.\n\n==The Welsh revolt, 1400\u201315==\nOn 16 September 1400, Owain acted, and was proclaimed Prince of Wales by a small band of followers<ref name=bbc/> which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the [[Dean of St Asaph]]. This was a revolutionary statement in itself. Owain\u2019s men quickly spread through north-east Wales. On 18 September, the town of Ruthin and De Grey's stronghold of [[Ruthin Castle]] were attacked.{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}<ref name=flint>{{cite web|url=http://flinttowncouncil.co.uk/flint-history/owain-glyndwr/|title=Flint Town Council / Owain Glynd\u0175r|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606210031/http://flinttowncouncil.co.uk/flint-history/owain-glyndwr/|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Denbigh]], [[Rhuddlan]], [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], [[Hawarden]], and [[Holt, Wales|Holt]] followed quickly afterward.

The [[Tudors of Penmynydd]] were a prominent Anglesey family who were closely associated with King Richard II. [[Gwilym ap Tudur]] and [[Rhys ap Tudur]] were both military leaders of a contingent of soldiers raised in 1396 to protect North Wales against any invasion by the French. They joined the king in his military expedition to Ireland in 1398. When Glynd\u0175r announced his revolt, Rhys, Gwilym and their third brother, [[Maredudd ap Tudur]], openly swore allegiance; they were Glynd\u0175r's cousin on their mother's side.{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=19}}\n\nKing Henry IV, on his way back from invading Scotland, turned his army towards Wales. By 26 September he was in [[Shrewsbury]] ready to invade Wales. In a lightning campaign, Henry led his army around North Wales. He was harassed constantly by bad weather and the attacks of Welsh [[guerrilla]]s.<ref name=Bradley/> When he arrived on Anglesey, he harried the island, burning villages and monasteries including the [[Llanfaes Friary]] near [[Bangor, Gwynedd]].{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=21}} This was the historical burial place of the Tudor family.{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=17}} Rhys ap Tudur led an ambush of the king's forces at a place called Rhos Fawr ('the Great Moor'){{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=84}}.

Much of northern and central Wales went over to Owain. Multiple attacks were recorded on English towns, castles, and [[manorialism|manors]] throughout the north. Even in the south in [[Brecon]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] reports began to come in of banditry and lawlessness. King Henry appointed [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy]] \u2013 the warrior son of the powerful [[Earl of Northumberland]] \u2013 to bring the country to order.<ref name=Bradley/> An amnesty was issued in March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, Rhys and Gwilym ap Tudur.{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=22}}\n\nMost of the country agreed to pay all the usual taxes, but the Tudurs knew that they needed a bargaining chip if they were to lift the dire threat hanging over them. They decided to capture [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]\u2019s great castle at [[Conwy]]. Although the [[Conwy Castle]] garrison amounted to just fifteen [[men-at-arms]] and sixty [[archery|archers]], it was well stocked and easily reinforced from the sea; and in any case, the Tudurs only had forty men. On [[Good Friday]], 1 April, all but five of the garrison were in the little church in the town when a carpenter appeared at the castle gate, who, according to [[Adam of Usk]]\u2019s Chronicon, \"feigned to come for his accustomed work\". Once inside, the Welsh carpenter attacked the two guards and threw open the gate to allow entry to the rebels.<ref name=Bradley/> When Percy arrived from [[Denbigh]] with 120 men-at-arms and 300 archers, he knew it would take a great deal more to get inside so formidable a fortress and was forced to negotiate.<ref name=Bradley/> A compromise was reached which would have resulted in pardons issued, but on 20 April, the king overruled Percy's local decision. It was not until Gwilym ap Tudur began to write directly to the king that an agreement was reached on 24 June.{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=22}} However, this was on the condition that nine of the defenders be turned over to justice.<ref name=Bradley/>\n\nOwain also scored his first major victory in the field in May or June, at [[Mynydd Hyddgen]] near [[Pumlumon]]. Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped at the bottom of the Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers from [[Pembrokeshire]] ('little England beyond Wales'), charged down on them. Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200.<ref name=Cistercian>{{Cite web |url=http://cistercian-way.newport.ac.uk/place.asp?PlaceID=189 |title=\"Owain Glyndwr\", The Cistercian Way |access-date=4 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606215857/http://cistercian-way.newport.ac.uk/place.asp?PlaceID=189 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The situation was sufficiently serious for the King to assemble another [[punitive expedition]]. This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Hereford Castle]], Henry IV's forces drove through [[Powys]] toward the [[Strata Florida Abbey]]. The [[Cistercian]] house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to remind them of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]]. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the [[abbey]] and executed a [[monk]] suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at [[Worcester]] on 28 October 1401<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=109}}</ref> with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the [[Battle of Tuthill]], an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of [[Caernarfon Castle]] on 2 November 1401.\n\nThe English saw that if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected supporters of the deposed King Richard, rumours of whose survival were widely circulating. They were concerned about the potential for disaffection in [[Cheshire]] and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained that he was not receiving sufficient support from the King and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement.{{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=137}} The core Lancastrian supporters would have none of this. They struck back with [[Penal Laws against Wales 1402|anti-Welsh legislation]] designed to establish English dominance in Wales.<ref name=Bradley/> The laws included prohibiting any Welshman from buying land in England, from holding any senior public office in Wales, from bearing arms, and from holding any castle or defending any house; no Welsh child was to be educated or apprenticed to any trade, no Englishman could be convicted in any suit brought by a Welshman, Welshmen were to be severely penalised when marrying English women, any Englishman marrying a Welsh woman was disenfranchised, and all public assembly was forbidden.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=360}}</ref> These laws sent a message to any of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.\n\nIn the same year, 1402, Owain captured his arch enemy, Reynald or [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] in an ambush in late January or early February at [[Ruthin]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=115}}</ref> He was to hold him for a year until he received a substantial ransom from King Henry. In June 1402, Owain's forces encountered an army led by Sir [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], the uncle of the [[Earl of March]], at [[Battle of Bryn Glas|Bryn Glas]] in central Wales. [[Mortimer]]'s army was badly defeated and Mortimer was captured. It is reported that the Welsh women following Owain\u2019s army, killed the wounded English soldiers and mutilated the bodies of the dead, supposedly in revenge for plundering and rape by the English soldiery the previous year. Glynd\u0175r offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than himself so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Sir Edmund negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owain's daughters, [[Catrin ferch Owain Glynd\u0175r|Catrin]].<ref name=Pierce>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-OWAI-GLY-1354.html|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt is also in 1402, that mention of the [[French people|French]] and [[Brittany|Bretons]] helping Owain were first heard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland as a base from which to fight the English. French [[privateers]] began to attack English ships in the [[Irish Sea]] and provide weapons and other provisions to the Welsh. French and [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Piracy|freebooters]] were also active in Owain's attacks.\n\n===The revolt spreads===\n[[File:Caernarfon castle interior.jpg|thumb|300px|The ward of [[Caernarfon Castle]], besieged by Glynd\u0175r in 1403, showing (from left to right) the Black Tower, the Chamberlain's Tower, and the Eagle Tower.]]\n\n1403 marks the year when the revolt became truly national in Wales. Owain struck out to the west and the south. Recreating [[Llywelyn the Great]]'s campaign in the west, Owain marched down the [[River Towy|Tywi Valley]]. Village after village rose to join him. English [[manorialism|manors]] and castles fell or their inhabitants surrendered. Finally, [[Carmarthen]], one of the main English power-bases in the west, fell and was occupied by Owain. Owain then turned around and attacked [[Glamorgan]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]]. [[Abergavenny Castle]] was attacked and the walled town burned. Owain pushed on down the valley of the [[River Usk]] to the coast, burning [[Usk]] and taking [[Cardiff Castle]] and [[Newport Castle]]. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at [[Oxford University]] were leaving their studies for Owain and Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales in droves.<ref name=flint/> Owain could also draw on the seasoned troops from the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh [[archery|archers]] and experienced [[men-at-arms]] left English service to join the rebellion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn the north of Wales, Owain's supporters launched a further attack on [[Caernarfon Castle]] (this time with French support) and almost captured it.<ref name=\"Novasys Ltd\">{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=183}}</ref> In response, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]] (son of Henry IV and the future Henry V) attacked and burned Owain's homes at [[Glyndyfrdwy]] and [[Sycharth]]. On 10 July 1403, Hotspur declared against the King by challenging his cousin Henry's right to the throne and by raising his standard in revolt in Cheshire at Chester, a bastion of support for King Richard II. Henry of Monmouth, then only 16, turned to the north to meet Hotspur. On 21 July, Henry arrived in [[Shrewsbury]] just before Hotspur, forcing the rebel army to camp outside the town. Henry forced the [[Battle of Shrewsbury|battle]] before the [[Earl of Northumberland]] had also managed to reach Shrewsbury. Thus, on 22 July, Henry was able to fight before the full strength of the rebels was present and on ground of his own choosing. The battle lasted all day, Prince Henry was badly wounded in the face by an arrow but continued to fight alongside his men. When the cry went out that Hotspur had fallen, the rebels' resistance began to falter and crumble. By the end of the day, Hotspur was dead and his rebellion was over. Over 300 [[knight]]s had died and up to 20,000 men were killed or injured.\n\nIn the summer of 1404, Owain captured and garrisoned the great western castles of [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] and [[Aberystwyth Castle|Aberystwyth]].<ref name=Cistercian/> Anxious to demonstrate his seriousness as a ruler, he held court at [[Harlech]] and appointed the deft and brilliant [[Gruffydd Young]] as his chancellor. Soon afterwards he was said by Adam of Usk to have called his first Parliament (or more properly a {{lang|cy|Cynulliad}} or \"gathering\"<ref>Note that ''Cynulliad'' is also the word used in the [[Welsh language]] for the 1999-established [[National Assembly for Wales]].</ref>) of all Wales at [[Machynlleth]] where he was crowned [[Prince of Wales]]. Senior churchmen and important members of society flowed to his banner. English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and [[fortified manor house]]s.\n\n===Tripartite Indenture and the Year of the French===\nOwain demonstrated his new status by negotiating the \"[[Tripartite Indenture]]\" in February 1405 with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy the 1st [[Earl of Northumberland]].<ref name=Pierce/> The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales between the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] including most of [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], and [[Herefordshire]]. The [[Mortimer]] Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester]], would take the north of England. Local English communities in [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Montgomeryshire]] had ceased active resistance and were making their own treaties with the rebels. It was rumoured that old allies of Richard II were sending money and arms to the Welsh and the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Franciscan]]s were funneling funds to support the rebellion. Furthermore, the Percy rebellion was still viable; even after the defeat of the Percy Archbishop Scrope in May. In fact the Percy rebellion was not to end until 1408 when the Sheriff of Yorkshire defeated Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland at [[Bramham Moor]]. Owain was capitalising on the political situation to make the best deal he possibly could.\n\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr.jpg|thumb|left|Owain Glynd\u0175r]]\n\nThings were improving on the international front too. Although negotiations with the Lords of [[Ireland]] were unsuccessful, Owain had reasons to hope that the French and [[Bretons]] might be more welcoming. In May 1404, Owain had dispatched [[Gruffydd Young]] and his brother-in-law, John Hanmer, to France to negotiate a [[treaty]] with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. Joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces had already attacked and laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]] in November 1403.<ref name=\"Novasys Ltd\"/> The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow [[Celts]] in the then independent [[Brittany]] and [[Scotland]].<ref name=Pierce/> Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain\u2019s war. Scots ships had raided English settlements on the [[Lleyn peninsula|Llyn Peninsula]] in 1400 and 1401.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1403 a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Plymouth]] while the French made a landing on the [[Isle of Wight]]. By 1404 they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and devastating the coasts of [[Devon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n1405 was the \"Year of the French\" in Wales. On the continent the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English [[Aquitaine]]. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at [[Milford Haven]] in west Wales. They had left [[Brest, France|Brest]] in July with more than 3,000 [[knight]]s and [[men-at-arms]] led by [[Jean II de Rieux]], Breton lord and [[Marshal of France]]. Unfortunately, they had not been provided with sufficient fresh water and many warhorses had died. They did though bring modern [[siege]] equipment. Joined by Owain's forces they marched inland and took the town of [[Haverfordwest]] but failed to take the castle. They then moved on and retook [[Carmarthen]] and laid siege to [[Tenby]]. What happened next is something of a mystery. The Franco-Welsh force marched right across South Wales (according to local tradition) and invaded England. According to one medieval chronicler, the unreliable [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]], they marched through [[Herefordshire]] and on into [[Worcestershire]] where they met the English army west of [[Great Witley]], just ten miles from [[Worcester]], with Henry IV's army arrayed on [[Abberley]] Hill facing south towards Owain's army facing north on the defensive [[Iron Age]] hill fort of Woodbury Hill, still known locally as Owain's Hill. The armies took up battle positions daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Neither initiated battle. Then, for reasons that have never been clear, both sides withdrew. Henry's strategy was to prolong the stand off and weaken and intimidate the Welsh army. The Welsh and French army cut off from resupply withdrew at nightfall back through Wales.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} If these events happened, it is strange that they left no trace in any contemporary English administrative or chronicle sources.\n\nMore French were to arrive as the year went on{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} but the high-point of French involvement had passed.\n\n===The rebellion founders===\n[[File:Charles VI de France - Dialogues de Pierre Salmon - Bib de Gen\u00e8ve MsFr165f4.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Charles VI of France]] did not continue to support Glynd\u0175r's revolt]]\n\nIn 1406, he announced his national programme. He declared his vision of an independent Welsh state with a parliament and separate Welsh church. There would be two national [[university|universities]] (one in the south and one in the north) and return to the [[Welsh law|traditional law]] of [[Hywel Dda]]. By this time, most French forces had withdrawn after politics shifted in Paris toward the peace party. Even Owain's so-called \"[[Pennal]] Letter\", in which he promised [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] to shift the allegiance of the Welsh Church from [[Rome]] to [[Avignon]], produced no effect. The moment had passed.\n\nThere were other signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early in the year Owain\u2019s forces suffered defeats at [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] and [[Usk]] at the [[Battle of Pwll Melyn]]. Although it is very difficult to understand what happened at these two battles, it appears that Henry of Monmouth or possibly [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Sir John Talbot]] defeated substantial Welsh raiding parties led by [[Rhys Gethin]] (\"Swarthy Rhys\") and Owain\u2019s eldest son, [[Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r]]. The exact date and order of these battles is subject to dispute. However, they may have resulted in the death of Rhys Gethin at Grosmont and Owain's brother, Tudur, at [[Usk]] and the capture of Gruffudd. Gruffudd was sent to the [[Tower of London]] and after six years died in prison. King Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more ruthless tactics. [[Adam of Usk]] says that after the [[Battle of Pwll Melyn]] near [[Usk]], King Henry had three hundred prisoners beheaded in front of Usk Castle. John ap Hywel, Abbot of the nearby [[Llantarnam]] [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]], was killed during the [[Battle of Usk]] as he ministered to the dying and wounded on both sides. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland. Over the next year they would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.\n\nAt the same time, the English were adopting a different strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions favoured by his father, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In March, 1,000 men from all over [[Flintshire]] appeared before the Chief Justitiar of the county and agreed to pay a communal fine for their adherence to Glynd\u0175r. Gradually the same pattern was repeated throughout the country. In July the Earl of Arundel\u2019s north-east Lordship around [[Oswestry]] and [[Clun]] submitted. One by one the Lordships began to surrender. By midsummer, Owain\u2019s castle at [[Aberystwyth]] was under siege. That autumn [[Aberystwyth Castle]] surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of [[Harlech Castle]]. Last minute desperate envoys were sent to the French for help. There was no response. [[Gruffydd Young]] was sent to [[Scotland]] to attempt to coordinate action but nothing was to come of that either. [[Harlech Castle]] fell in 1409. [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]] died in the final battle and Owain\u2019s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the [[Tower of London]]. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.\n\nOwain remained free but now he was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued to splutter on. In 1410, Owain readied his supporters for a last raid deep into [[Shropshire]]. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate [[suicide]] raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. [[Rhys Ddu]] (\"Black Rhys\") of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], one of Owain\u2019s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: \"\u2026laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to [[Tyburn]] through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on [[London Bridge]].\" [[Philip Scudamore]] and [[Rhys ap Tudur]] were also beheaded and their heads displayed at [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Chester]] (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).\n\nIn 1412, Owain captured, and later ransomed, a leading [[Wales|Welsh]] supporter of King Henry's, [[Dafydd Gam]] (\"Crooked David\"), in an ambush in [[Brecon]]. These were the last flashes of the revolt. This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the [[Herefordshire]] based [[Lollard]] leader, Sir [[John Oldcastle]], was communicating with Owain and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south. Outlaws and bandits left over from the rebellion were still active in [[Snowdonia]].\n\nBut by then things were changing. King Henry IV died in 1413 and his son [[King Henry V]] began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Royal Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. In a symbolic and [[pious]] gesture, the body of deposed [[King Richard II]] was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1415 Henry V offered a Pardon to Owain, as he prepared for war with France. There is evidence that the new King Henry V was in negotiations with Owain's son, [[Maredudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r]], but nothing was to come of it. In 1416 Maredudd was himself offered a Pardon but refused. Perhaps his father Owain was still alive and he was unwilling to accept it while he lived. He finally accepted a Royal Pardon in 1421, suggesting that Owain Glynd\u0175r was finally dead. There is some evidence to suggest, in the poetry of the Welsh [[Bard]] [[Llawdden]] for example, that a few diehards continued to fight on even after 1421 under the leadership of Owain's son-in-law [[Phylib ap Rhys]].\n\nThe ''[[Annals of Owain Glyndwr]]'' (Panton MS. 22) finish in the year 1422. The last entry regarding the prince reads:\n:''1415 \u2013 Owain went into hiding on [[St Matthew]]'s Day in Harvest (21 September), and thereafter his hiding place was unknown. Very many said that he died; the seers maintain he did not.''{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==The aftermath of rebellion in Wales==\nBy 1415, full English rule was returned to Wales. The leading rebels were dead, imprisoned, or impoverished through massive fines. Scarcely a [[parish]] or family in Wales, English ''or'' Welsh, had not been affected in some way. The cost in loss of life, physical destruction, and ruined lives was enormous. Wales, already a poor country on the border of England, was further impoverished by pillage, economic blockade and communal fines. Reports by travellers talk of ruined castles, such as [[Montgomery Castle]] and Abbeys such as [[Strata Florida Abbey]] and [[Abbeycwmhir]]. Grass grew in the market squares of many towns such as [[Oswestry]] and Welsh commerce had almost ground to a halt. Land that had previously been productive was now empty wasteland with no tenants to work the land. As late as 1492, a Royal Official in lowland [[Glamorgan]] was still citing the devastation caused by the revolt as the reason why he was unable to deliver promised revenues to the King.\n\nMany prominent families were ruined. In 1411, John Hanmer pleaded poverty as the reason why he could not pay the fines imposed on him. The Tudors no longer lorded it over [[Anglesey]] and northwest Wales as they had done throughout the late 14th century. The family seemed finished until the third Tudor brother, Maredudd, went to [[London]] and established a new destiny for the family. Others eventually surrendered and made peace with the new order. The redoubtable [[Henry Dwn]]{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} who with the French and Bretons had laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]] in 1403 and 1404 made his peace and accepted a fine. Somehow he avoided paying a penny. For many years after his surrender and despite official proscriptions, he sheltered rebels on the run, levied fines on 200 individuals that had not supported him, rode around the county with his retinue, and even plotted the murder of the King\u2019s justice. Nevertheless, his grandson fought alongside Henry V in 1415 at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Others could not fit into the new order. An unknown number of Owain\u2019s supporters went into exile. [[Henry Gwyn]] (\"White Henry\") \u2014 heir to the substantial Lordship of [[Llansteffan]] \u2014 left Wales forever and was to die in the service of [[Charles VI of France]] facing his old comrades at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. [[Gruffydd Young]] was another permanent exile. By 1415 he was in Paris. He was to live another 20 years being first Bishop of [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] in [[Scotland]] and later [[in partibus|titular bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]] in [[North Africa]].\n\nA series of penal laws were put in place, intended to prevent any further uprisings. These remained until the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]] and the reign of King [[Henry VII of England]];{{sfn | Evans| 1915|p=19}} also known as Henry Tudor, he was descended from the [[Tudors of Penmynydd]] and was part-Welsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=A royal dynasty|date=5 August 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/periods/tudors_02.shtml|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> Until then, the Welsh were prevented from holding property or land within the Welsh [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|boroughs]], were forbidden from serving on [[jury|juries]], could not intermarry with the English and were prevented from holding any office of the crown.

It was the last major manifestation of a Welsh independence movement before the incorporation of Wales into England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]].<ref>Gwyn A. Williams, ''When Was Wales? A History of the Welsh'' (London, 1991), p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n=== The fall of Richard II ===\nIn the last decade of the 14th century, [[Richard II of England]] had launched a bold plan to consolidate his hold on his Kingdom and break the power of the magnates who constantly threatened his authority. As part of this plan, Richard began to shift his power base from the southeast and London towards the County of [[Cheshire]] and systematically built up his power in nearby Wales. Wales was ruled through a patchwork of semi-autonomous feudal states, bishoprics, shires, and territory under direct Royal rule. Richard eliminated his rivals and took their land or gave it to his favourites. As he did so, he raised an entire class of Welsh people to fill the new posts created in his new [[fiefdom]]s. For these people, the final years of the reign of Richard II were full of opportunities. To the English magnates, it was a further sign that Richard was dangerously out of control.\n\nIn 1399, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], heir to the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], returned to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from [[Ireland]] to Wales to deal with Bolingbroke but he was arrested by [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], as he was on his way from [[Conwy Castle]] to meet Bolingbroke at [[Flint Castle]] supposedly to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Richard was imprisoned at [[Chester, England|Chester]] before being taken to London. Parliament quickly made Henry Bolingbroke [[Regent]] and then King. Richard died in [[Pontefract Castle]], shortly after the failed [[Epiphany Rising]] of English nobles in January 1400, but his death was not generally known for some time. In Wales, people like [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh had generally supported King Richard,<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/guide/ch10_revolt_of_owain_glyndwr.shtml|title=BBC Wales  \u2013 History \u2013 Themes  \u2013 Chapter 10: The revolt of Owain Glyndwr|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> who had succeeded his father, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], as [[Prince of Wales]]. With Richard removed, the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people became more limited. Many Welsh people seem to have been uncertain where this left them and their future.\n\nFor some time, supporters of the deposed king remained at large. On 10 January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester in support of the [[Epiphany Rising]]. An atmosphere of disorder was building along the Anglo-Welsh border.\n\n===The dispute between Owain Glynd\u0175r and de Grey===\nThe revolt reportedly began as an argument with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s English neighbour.<ref name=bbc/> Successive holders of the title [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] of Dyffryn Clwyd were [[England|English]] landowners in Wales. Glynd\u0175r had been engaged in a long-running land dispute with them.{{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=70}} He seems to have appealed to Parliament (though which one is not clear) to resolve the issue with the courts under King Richard finding in his favour. [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] \u2014 loyal to the new king \u2014 then appears to have used his influence to have that decision overturned.

Much of northern and central Wales went over to Owain. Multiple attacks were recorded on English towns, castles, and [[manorialism|manors]] throughout the north. Even in the south in [[Brecon]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] reports began to come in of banditry and lawlessness. King Henry appointed [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy]] \u2013 the warrior son of the powerful [[Earl of Northumberland]] \u2013 to bring the country to order.<ref name=Bradley/> An amnesty was issued in March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, Rhys and Gwilym ap Tudur.{{sfn | Griffiths|Thomas| 1985|p=22}}\n\nMost of the country agreed to pay all the usual taxes, but the Tudurs knew that they needed a bargaining chip if they were to lift the dire threat hanging over them. They decided to capture [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]\u2019s great castle at [[Conwy]]. Although the [[Conwy Castle]] garrison amounted to just fifteen [[men-at-arms]] and sixty [[archery|archers]], it was well stocked and easily reinforced from the sea; and in any case, the Tudurs only had forty men. On [[Good Friday]], 1 April, all but five of the garrison were in the little church in the town when a carpenter appeared at the castle gate, who, according to [[Adam of Usk]]\u2019s Chronicon, \"feigned to come for his accustomed work\". Once inside, the Welsh carpenter attacked the two guards and threw open the gate to allow entry to the rebels.<ref name=Bradley/> When Percy arrived from [[Denbigh]] with 120 men-at-arms and 300 archers, he knew it would take a great deal more to get inside so formidable a fortress and was forced to negotiate.<ref name=Bradley/> A compromise was reached which would have resulted in pardons issued, but on 20 April, the king overruled Percy's local decision.

Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped at the bottom of the Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers from [[Pembrokeshire]] ('little England beyond Wales'), charged down on them.

This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Hereford Castle]], Henry IV's forces drove through [[Powys]] toward the [[Strata Florida Abbey]]. The [[Cistercian]] house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to remind them of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]]. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the [[abbey]] and executed a [[monk]] suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at [[Worcester]] on 28 October 1401<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=109}}</ref> with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the [[Battle of Tuthill]], an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of [[Caernarfon Castle]] on 2 November 1401.\n\nThe English saw that if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected supporters of the deposed King Richard, rumours of whose survival were widely circulating. They were concerned about the potential for disaffection in [[Cheshire]] and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained that he was not receiving sufficient support from the King and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement.{{sfn | Parry| 2010|p=137}} The core Lancastrian supporters would have none of this. They struck back with [[Penal Laws against Wales 1402|anti-Welsh legislation]] designed to establish English dominance in Wales.<ref name=Bradley/> The laws included prohibiting any Welshman from buying land in England, from holding any senior public office in Wales, from bearing arms, and from holding any castle or defending any house; no Welsh child was to be educated or apprenticed to any trade, no Englishman could be convicted in any suit brought by a Welshman, Welshmen were to be severely penalised when marrying English women, any Englishman marrying a Welsh woman was disenfranchised, and all public assembly was forbidden.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=360}}</ref> These laws sent a message to any of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.\n\nIn the same year, 1402, Owain captured his arch enemy, Reynald or [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] in an ambush in late January or early February at [[Ruthin]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=115}}</ref> He was to hold him for a year until he received a substantial ransom from King Henry. In June 1402, Owain's forces encountered an army led by Sir [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], the uncle of the [[Earl of March]], at [[Battle of Bryn Glas|Bryn Glas]] in central Wales. [[Mortimer]]'s army was badly defeated and Mortimer was captured. It is reported that the Welsh women following Owain\u2019s army, killed the wounded English soldiers and mutilated the bodies of the dead, supposedly in revenge for plundering and rape by the English soldiery the previous year. Glynd\u0175r offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than himself so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Sir Edmund negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owain's daughters, [[Catrin ferch Owain Glynd\u0175r|Catrin]].<ref name=Pierce>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-OWAI-GLY-1354.html|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt is also in 1402, that mention of the [[French people|French]] and [[Brittany|Bretons]] helping Owain were first heard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland as a base from which to fight the English. French [[privateers]] began to attack English ships in the [[Irish Sea]] and provide weapons and other provisions to the Welsh. French and [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Piracy|freebooters]] were also active in Owain's attacks.\n\n===The revolt spreads===\n[[File:Caernarfon castle interior.jpg|thumb|300px|The ward of [[Caernarfon Castle]], besieged by Glynd\u0175r in 1403, showing (from left to right) the Black Tower, the Chamberlain's Tower, and the Eagle Tower.]]\n\n1403 marks the year when the revolt became truly national in Wales. Owain struck out to the west and the south. Recreating [[Llywelyn the Great]]'s campaign in the west, Owain marched down the [[River Towy|Tywi Valley]]. Village after village rose to join him. English [[manorialism|manors]] and castles fell or their inhabitants surrendered. Finally, [[Carmarthen]], one of the main English power-bases in the west, fell and was occupied by Owain. Owain then turned around and attacked [[Glamorgan]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]]. [[Abergavenny Castle]] was attacked and the walled town burned. Owain pushed on down the valley of the [[River Usk]] to the coast, burning [[Usk]] and taking [[Cardiff Castle]] and [[Newport Castle]]. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at [[Oxford University]] were leaving their studies for Owain and Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales in droves.<ref name=flint/> Owain could also draw on the seasoned troops from the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh [[archery|archers]] and experienced [[men-at-arms]] left English service to join the rebellion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn the north of Wales, Owain's supporters launched a further attack on [[Caernarfon Castle]] (this time with French support) and almost captured it.<ref name=\"Novasys Ltd\">{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=Charles|title=The Last Mab Darogan: The Life and Times of Owain Glyn Dwr|date=2010|publisher=Novasys Ltd|isbn=9780956555304|page=183}}</ref> In response, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]] (son of Henry IV and the future Henry V) attacked and burned Owain's homes at [[Glyndyfrdwy]] and [[Sycharth]]. On 10 July 1403, Hotspur declared against the King by challenging his cousin Henry's right to the throne and by raising his standard in revolt in Cheshire at Chester, a bastion of support for King Richard II. Henry of Monmouth, then only 16, turned to the north to meet Hotspur. On 21 July, Henry arrived in [[Shrewsbury]] just before Hotspur, forcing the rebel army to camp outside the town. Henry forced the [[Battle of Shrewsbury|battle]] before the [[Earl of Northumberland]] had also managed to reach Shrewsbury. Thus, on 22 July, Henry was able to fight before the full strength of the rebels was present and on ground of his own choosing. The battle lasted all day, Prince Henry was badly wounded in the face by an arrow but continued to fight alongside his men. When the cry went out that Hotspur had fallen, the rebels' resistance began to falter and crumble. By the end of the day, Hotspur was dead and his rebellion was over. Over 300 [[knight]]s had died and up to 20,000 men were killed or injured.\n\nIn the summer of 1404, Owain captured and garrisoned the great western castles of [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] and [[Aberystwyth Castle|Aberystwyth]].<ref name=Cistercian/> Anxious to demonstrate his seriousness as a ruler, he held court at [[Harlech]] and appointed the deft and brilliant [[Gruffydd Young]] as his chancellor. Soon afterwards he was said by Adam of Usk to have called his first Parliament (or more properly a {{lang|cy|Cynulliad}} or \"gathering\"<ref>Note that ''Cynulliad'' is also the word used in the [[Welsh language]] for the 1999-established [[National Assembly for Wales]].</ref>) of all Wales at [[Machynlleth]] where he was crowned [[Prince of Wales]]. Senior churchmen and important members of society flowed to his banner. English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and [[fortified manor house]]s.\n\n===Tripartite Indenture and the Year of the French===\nOwain demonstrated his new status by negotiating the \"[[Tripartite Indenture]]\" in February 1405 with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy the 1st [[Earl of Northumberland]].<ref name=Pierce/> The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales between the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] including most of [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], and [[Herefordshire]]. The [[Mortimer]] Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester]], would take the north of England. Local English communities in [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Montgomeryshire]] had ceased active resistance and were making their own treaties with the rebels. It was rumoured that old allies of Richard II were sending money and arms to the Welsh and the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Franciscan]]s were funneling funds to support the rebellion. Furthermore, the Percy rebellion was still viable; even after the defeat of the Percy Archbishop Scrope in May. In fact the Percy rebellion was not to end until 1408 when the Sheriff of Yorkshire defeated Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland at [[Bramham Moor]]. Owain was capitalising on the political situation to make the best deal he possibly could.\n\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr.jpg|thumb|left|Owain Glynd\u0175r]]\n\nThings were improving on the international front too. Although negotiations with the Lords of [[Ireland]] were unsuccessful, Owain had reasons to hope that the French and [[Bretons]] might be more welcoming. In May 1404, Owain had dispatched [[Gruffydd Young]] and his brother-in-law, John Hanmer, to France to negotiate a [[treaty]] with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. Joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces had already attacked and laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]] in November 1403.<ref name=\"Novasys Ltd\"/> The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow [[Celts]] in the then independent [[Brittany]] and [[Scotland]].<ref name=Pierce/> Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain\u2019s war. Scots ships had raided English settlements on the [[Lleyn peninsula|Llyn Peninsula]] in 1400 and 1401.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1403 a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Plymouth]] while the French made a landing on the [[Isle of Wight]]. By 1404 they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and devastating the coasts of [[Devon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n1405 was the \"Year of the French\" in Wales. On the continent the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English [[Aquitaine]]. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at [[Milford Haven]] in west Wales. They had left [[Brest, France|Brest]] in July with more than 3,000 [[knight]]s and [[men-at-arms]] led by [[Jean II de Rieux]], Breton lord and [[Marshal of France]]. Unfortunately, they had not been provided with sufficient fresh water and many warhorses had died. They did though bring modern [[siege]] equipment. Joined by Owain's forces they marched inland and took the town of [[Haverfordwest]] but failed to take the castle. They then moved on and retook [[Carmarthen]] and laid siege to [[Tenby]]. What happened next is something of a mystery. The Franco-Welsh force marched right across South Wales (according to local tradition) and invaded England. According to one medieval chronicler, the unreliable [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]], they marched through [[Herefordshire]] and on into [[Worcestershire]] where they met the English army west of [[Great Witley]], just ten miles from [[Worcester]], with Henry IV's army arrayed on [[Abberley]] Hill facing south towards Owain's army facing north on the defensive [[Iron Age]] hill fort of Woodbury Hill, still known locally as Owain's Hill. The armies took up battle positions daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Neither initiated battle. Then, for reasons that have never been clear, both sides withdrew. Henry's strategy was to prolong the stand off and weaken and intimidate the Welsh army. The Welsh and French army cut off from resupply withdrew at nightfall back through Wales.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} If these events happened, it is strange that they left no trace in any contemporary English administrative or chronicle sources.\n\nMore French were to arrive as the year went on{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} but the high-point of French involvement had passed.\n\n===The rebellion founders===\n[[File:Charles VI de France - Dialogues de Pierre Salmon - Bib de Gen\u00e8ve MsFr165f4.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Charles VI of France]] did not continue to support Glynd\u0175r's revolt]]\n\nIn 1406, he announced his national programme. He declared his vision of an independent Welsh state with a parliament and separate Welsh church. There would be two national [[university|universities]] (one in the south and one in the north) and return to the [[Welsh law|traditional law]] of [[Hywel Dda]]. By this time, most French forces had withdrawn after politics shifted in Paris toward the peace party. Even Owain's so-called \"[[Pennal]] Letter\", in which he promised [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] to shift the allegiance of the Welsh Church from [[Rome]] to [[Avignon]], produced no effect. The moment had passed.\n\nThere were other signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early in the year Owain\u2019s forces suffered defeats at [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] and [[Usk]] at the [[Battle of Pwll Melyn]]. Although it is very difficult to understand what happened at these two battles, it appears that Henry of Monmouth or possibly [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Sir John Talbot]] defeated substantial Welsh raiding parties led by [[Rhys Gethin]] (\"Swarthy Rhys\") and Owain\u2019s eldest son, [[Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r]]. The exact date and order of these battles is subject to dispute. However, they may have resulted in the death of Rhys Gethin at Grosmont and Owain's brother, Tudur, at [[Usk]] and the capture of Gruffudd. Gruffudd was sent to the [[Tower of London]] and after six years died in prison. King Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more ruthless tactics. [[Adam of Usk]] says that after the [[Battle of Pwll Melyn]] near [[Usk]], King Henry had three hundred prisoners beheaded in front of Usk Castle. John ap Hywel, Abbot of the nearby [[Llantarnam]] [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]], was killed during the [[Battle of Usk]] as he ministered to the dying and wounded on both sides. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland. Over the next year they would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.\n\nAt the same time, the English were adopting a different strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions favoured by his father, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In March, 1,000 men from all over [[Flintshire]] appeared before the Chief Justitiar of the county and agreed to pay a communal fine for their adherence to Glynd\u0175r. Gradually the same pattern was repeated throughout the country. In July the Earl of Arundel\u2019s north-east Lordship around [[Oswestry]] and [[Clun]] submitted. One by one the Lordships began to surrender. By midsummer, Owain\u2019s castle at [[Aberystwyth]] was under siege. That autumn [[Aberystwyth Castle]] surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of [[Harlech Castle]]. Last minute desperate envoys were sent to the French for help. There was no response. [[Gruffydd Young]] was sent to [[Scotland]] to attempt to coordinate action but nothing was to come of that either. [[Harlech Castle]] fell in 1409. [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]] died in the final battle and Owain\u2019s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the [[Tower of London]]. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.\n\nOwain remained free but now he was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued to splutter on. In 1410, Owain readied his supporters for a last raid deep into [[Shropshire]]. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate [[suicide]] raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. [[Rhys Ddu]] (\"Black Rhys\") of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], one of Owain\u2019s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: \"\u2026laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to [[Tyburn]] through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on [[London Bridge]].\" [[Philip Scudamore]] and [[Rhys ap Tudur]] were also beheaded and their heads displayed at [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Chester]] (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).\n\nIn 1412, Owain captured, and later ransomed, a leading [[Wales|Welsh]] supporter of King Henry's, [[Dafydd Gam]] (\"Crooked David\"), in an ambush in [[Brecon]]. These were the last flashes of the revolt. This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the [[Herefordshire]] based [[Lollard]] leader, Sir [[John Oldcastle]], was communicating with Owain and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south. Outlaws and bandits left over from the rebellion were still active in [[Snowdonia]].\n\nBut by then things were changing. King Henry IV died in 1413 and his son [[King Henry V]] began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Royal Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. In a symbolic and [[pious]] gesture, the body of deposed [[King Richard II]] was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1415 Henry V offered a Pardon to Owain, as he prepared for war with France. There is evidence that the new King Henry V was in negotiations with Owain's son, [[Maredudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r]], but nothing was to come of it. In 1416 Maredudd was himself offered a Pardon but refused. Perhaps his father Owain was still alive and he was unwilling to accept it while he lived. He finally accepted a Royal Pardon in 1421, suggesting that Owain Glynd\u0175r was finally dead. There is some evidence to suggest, in the poetry of the Welsh [[Bard]] [[Llawdden]] for example, that a few diehards continued to fight on even after 1421 under the leadership of Owain's son-in-law [[Phylib ap Rhys]].\n\nThe ''[[Annals of Owain Glyndwr]]'' (Panton MS. 22) finish in the year 1422. The last entry regarding the prince reads:\n:''1415 \u2013 Owain went into hiding on [[St Matthew]]'s Day in Harvest (21 September), and thereafter his hiding place was unknown. Very many said that he died; the seers maintain he did not.''{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==The aftermath of rebellion in Wales==\nBy 1415, full English rule was returned to Wales. The leading rebels were dead, imprisoned, or impoverished through massive fines. Scarcely a [[parish]] or family in Wales, English ''or'' Welsh, had not been affected in some way. The cost in loss of life, physical destruction, and ruined lives was enormous. Wales, already a poor country on the border of England, was further impoverished by pillage, economic blockade and communal fines. Reports by travellers talk of ruined castles, such as [[Montgomery Castle]] and Abbeys such as [[Strata Florida Abbey]] and [[Abbeycwmhir]]. Grass grew in the market squares of many towns such as [[Oswestry]] and Welsh commerce had almost ground to a halt. Land that had previously been productive was now empty wasteland with no tenants to work the land. As late as 1492, a Royal Official in lowland [[Glamorgan]] was still citing the devastation caused by the revolt as the reason why he was unable to deliver promised revenues to the King.\n\nMany prominent families were ruined. In 1411, John Hanmer pleaded poverty as the reason why he could not pay the fines imposed on him. The Tudors no longer lorded it over [[Anglesey]] and northwest Wales as they had done throughout the late 14th century. The family seemed finished until the third Tudor brother, Maredudd, went to [[London]] and established a new destiny for the family. Others eventually surrendered and made peace with the new order. The redoubtable [[Henry Dwn]]{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} who with the French and Bretons had laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]] in 1403 and 1404 made his peace and accepted a fine. Somehow he avoided paying a penny. For many years after his surrender and despite official proscriptions, he sheltered rebels on the run, levied fines on 200 individuals that had not supported him, rode around the county with his retinue, and even plotted the murder of the King\u2019s justice. Nevertheless, his grandson fought alongside Henry V in 1415 at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Others could not fit into the new order. An unknown number of Owain\u2019s supporters went into exile. [[Henry Gwyn]] (\"White Henry\") \u2014 heir to the substantial Lordship of [[Llansteffan]] \u2014 left Wales forever and was to die in the service of [[Charles VI of France]] facing his old comrades at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].
