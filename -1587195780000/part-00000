She also wants to reduce the cost of childcare for struggling families. She would eliminate Michigan's current 3rd grade \"read or flunk\" policy, which she has said penalizes students who have been failed by the education system, and would instead work to improve their reading skills. She proposes that all high school students be offered two years of debt-free higher education, either college or post-secondary training for skilled trades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/what-michigan-schools-will-look-under-governor-whitmer-or-schuette|title=What Michigan schools will look like under Governor Whitmer or Schuette|date=October 25, 2018|accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Health care===\nWhitmer has said she would fight Republican efforts to take away protections for patients with preexisting conditions. In the State Senate, Whitmer successfully worked to expand Medicaid coverage in the state. She has spoken against single-payer healthcare as unrealistic.

On 26 May 1824, at the age of 21 and with Humboldt's recommendation, Liebig became a professor ''extraordinarius'' at the [[University of Giessen]].<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|35}} Liebig's appointment was part of an attempt to modernize the University of Giessen and attract more students. He received a small stipend, without laboratory funding or access to facilities.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\nHis situation was complicated by the presence of existing faculty: Professor Wilhelm Zimmermann (1780\u20131825) taught general chemistry as part of the philosophy faculty, leaving medical chemistry and pharmacy to Professor Philipp Vogt in the medical faculty. Vogt was happy to support a reorganization in which pharmacy was taught by Liebig and became the responsibility of the faculty of arts, rather than the faculty of medicine. Zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully with Liebig for students and their lecture fees.  He refused to allow Liebig to use existing space and equipment, and finally committed suicide on 19 July 1825.  The deaths of Zimmermann and a Professor Blumhof who taught technology and mining opened the way for Liebig to apply for a full professorship. Liebig was appointed to the ''[[ordentlicher Professor|Ordentlicher]]'' chair in chemistry on 7 December 1825, receiving a considerably increased salary and a laboratory allowance.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\nLiebig married Henriette \"Jettchen\" Moldenhauer (1807\u20131881), the daughter of a state official, in May 1826.

Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and Swedish [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]], before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830.  It involved an ingenious array of five glass bulbs, called a  ''[[Kaliapparat]]''  to trap the oxidation product of the carbon in the sample, following combustion of the sample. Before reaching the ''Kaliapparat'', the combustion gases were conducted through a tube of hygroscopic [[calcium chloride]], which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor.

After working with other scientists, [[Carl August von Steinheil]] approached Liebig in 1856 to see if he could develop a silvering technique capable of producing high-quality optical mirrors for use in [[reflecting telescopes]]. Liebig was able to develop blemish-free mirrors by adding copper to ammoniated silver nitrate and sugar.

Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging 30 papers per year between 1830 and 1840.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|76}} Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function.  Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination of\nthe nitrogen content of bases;<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|77}}\nthe study of chlorination and the isolation of [[chloral]] (1832);<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|83}}\nthe identification of the [[ethyl radical]] (1834);<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|82}}\nthe oxidation of alcohol and formation of [[aldehyde]] (1835);<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|84}}\nthe polybasic theory of organic acids (1838);<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|86\u201387}}\nand the degradation of [[urea]] (1837).<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|88\u201389}}\n\nWriting about the analysis of urine, a complex organic product, he made a declaration that reveals both the changes that were occurring in chemistry over a short time and the impact of his own work.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|89}}  At a time when many chemists such as [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] still insisted on a hard and fast separation between the organic and inorganic, Liebig asserted:\n\n{{quote|text=\"The production of all organic substances no longer belongs just to living organisms.  It must be seen as not only probable, but as certain, that we shall be able to produce them in our laboratories.  Sugar, salicin, and morphine will be artificially produced.

Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of [[Karl Vogt]] (1817\u20131895), [[Jacob Moleschott]] (1822\u20131893), and [[Ludwig B\u00fcchner]] (1824\u20131899).{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Plant nutrition===\nBy the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability.  His book ''Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie'' (''Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology'') (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs. It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential.<ref name=Brock/>\n\nLiebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry. The first part of the book focused on plant nutrition, the second was on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|148}} Liebig's awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], promoting ideas such as the recycling of [[sewage]].<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|250\u2013270}}\n\nLiebig argued against prevalent theories about role of [[humus]] in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition. Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb. Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of \"vital force\" distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials.<ref name=Hill>{{cite book|author-last1=Hill|author-first1=Jane F.|chapter=Translator's Introduction|author-last2=de Saussure|author-first2=Theodore|title=Chemical research on plant growth|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-4136-6|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVVJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR15|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nEarly studies of photosynthesis had identified carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as important, but disagreed over their sources and mechanisms of action. Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water. Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water. Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xv-xxi}} [[Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure]]'s experiments, reported in ''Recherches Chimiques sur la V\u00e9g\u00e9tation'' (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources, and that water was a likely source of hydrogen. He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown. However, the implications of De Saussure's results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xxii-xxvii}}\n\nLiebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xxix}} By the late 1830s, researchers such as [[Karl Sprengel]] were using Liebig's methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|106}} Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|148}}\n\nIn his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth. He reported that plants acquire carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H<sub>2</sub>O). In addition to emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air. This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|181}}\n\n[[File:Minimum-Tonne.svg|thumb|right|Liebig's barrel]]\nLiebig also popularized Carl Sprengel's \"theorem of minimum\" (known as the [[Liebig's Law of the Minimum|law of the minimum]]), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource.  A plant's development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply.  This concept of limitation can be visualized as \"Liebig's barrel\", a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element. A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level. This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture.\n\n''Organic Chemistry'' was not intended as a guide to practical agriculture. Liebig's lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism. Nonetheless, Liebig's writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|165}}\n\nOne of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of [[nitrogen]]-based [[fertilizer]]. In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that the atmosphere contained insufficient nitrogen, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|120}} Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of [[ammonia]], and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc.)\n\nHe later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years. An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|121\u2013124}} When tested in a farmer's field, Liebig's manure was found to have no appreciable effect.<ref>Matter-of-Fact (July 1847) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048680383&view=1up&seq=214 Liebig's System of Manuring], [[The Cultivator]] series 2, volume 4, page 208 via [[HathiTrust]]</ref>\n\nLiebig's difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized. By the publication of the seventh German edition of ''Agricultural Chemistry'' he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|179}} He was instrumental in the use of [[guano]] for nitrogen.<ref>Charles Mann (2011) [https://archive.org/details/1493uncoveringne00mann 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created], page 214, Knopf</ref>\nNitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry.<ref name=Travis2013>{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=Anthony S.|title=Dirty Business|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2013|volume=31|issue=1|page=7|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/dirty-business|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Plant and animal physiology===\nLiebig's work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential. By 1842, he had published ''Chimie organique appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la physiologie animale et \u00e0 la pathologie'', published in English as '' Animal Chemistry, or, Organic Chemistry in its Applications to Physiology and Pathology'', presenting a chemical theory of metabolism.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|185}} The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes.  Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter.  He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|184}}\n\nFrench researchers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and lacked the ability to synthesize them. Liebig's work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starches.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|187}} Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|189\u2013190}}\n\nLiebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the \"ingesta and excreta\" of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|191}}  He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|191\u2013193}} This proposed model was justifiably criticized. Berzelius stingingly stated that \"this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table\".<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|194}} Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research.  The third and last edition of ''Animal Chemistry'' (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|195\u2013197}}\n\nThe third area discussed in ''Animal Chemistry'' was fermentation and putrefaction. Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as [[Decomposition|eremacausis]] (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable \"affinities\" reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|205}}  Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body's \"chemical factory\", where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place. He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading contagion. Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had significant implications for doctors, sanitarians, and social reformers. The English medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' reviewed Liebig's work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|207}} Liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|214}}\n\nIn 1850, Liebig investigated [[spontaneous human combustion]], dismissing the simplistic explanations based on [[ethanol]] due to alcoholism.<ref name=Ford2012>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Brian J.|title=Solving the Mystery of Spontaneous Human Combustion|journal=The Microscope|year=2012|volume=60|issue=2|pages=63\u201372|url=http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231220/http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Liebig and the chemistry of food===\n\n====Methods of cookery====\nLiebig drew upon his work in plant nutrition and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had significant implications for cookery. In his ''Researches on the Chemistry of Food'' (1847) Liebig argued that eating not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals, was important. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded.  For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews).<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|217\u2013218}}\n\nLiebig was acclaimed in ''The Lancet'' for revealing \"the true principles of cookery\", and physicians promoted \"rational diets\" based on his ideas. Well-known British cookery writer [[Eliza Acton]] responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'', and subtitling the edition accordingly.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|218\u2013219}}  Liebig's idea that \"[[searing]] meat seals in the juices\", though still widely believed, is not true.<ref name=McGee2004>{{cite book |chapter=The Searing Question | last=McGee |first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn=0-684-80001-2|page=161}}</ref>\n\n====Liebig's Extract of Meat Company====\n[[File:Liebig Company Memorial Trading Card 01.12.001 front.tif|thumb|right|upright|Memorial tradecard commemorating Justus von Liebig, from Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]]\n[[File:Liebig-Muenchen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Justus von Liebig statue, Munich, Germany]]\n\n{{Main|Liebig's Extract of Meat Company}}\n\nBuilding on his theories of the nutritional value of meat fluids, and seeking an inexpensive nutrition source for Europe's poor, Liebig developed a formula for producing beef extract.

German cookery writer [[Henriette Davidis]] wrote recipes for ''Improved and Economic Cookery'' and other cookbooks.   [[Katherina Prato]] wrote an Austro-Hungarian recipe book, ''Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte'' (1879). [[Hannah M.

Colorful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product.<ref name=\"Brock\"/>{{rp|234\u2013237}}\n\nThe company also worked with British chemist [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] to develop a related product, which it registered some years after Liebig's death, under the \"[[Oxo (food)|Oxo]]\" trademark.

He worked with his father for the next two years,<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|7\u20138}} then attended the [[University of Bonn]], studying under [[Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner]], his father's business associate.

On 26 May 1824, at the age of 21 and with Humboldt's recommendation, Liebig became a professor ''extraordinarius'' at the [[University of Giessen]].<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|35}} Liebig's appointment was part of an attempt to modernize the University of Giessen and attract more students. He received a small stipend, without laboratory funding or access to facilities.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\nHis situation was complicated by the presence of existing faculty: Professor Wilhelm Zimmermann (1780\u20131825) taught general chemistry as part of the philosophy faculty, leaving medical chemistry and pharmacy to Professor Philipp Vogt in the medical faculty. Vogt was happy to support a reorganization in which pharmacy was taught by Liebig and became the responsibility of the faculty of arts, rather than the faculty of medicine. Zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully with Liebig for students and their lecture fees.  He refused to allow Liebig to use existing space and equipment, and finally committed suicide on 19 July 1825.  The deaths of Zimmermann and a Professor Blumhof who taught technology and mining opened the way for Liebig to apply for a full professorship. Liebig was appointed to the ''[[ordentlicher Professor|Ordentlicher]]'' chair in chemistry on 7 December 1825, receiving a considerably increased salary and a laboratory allowance.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\nLiebig married Henriette \"Jettchen\" Moldenhauer (1807\u20131881), the daughter of a state official, in May 1826.

Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and Swedish [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]], before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830.  It involved an ingenious array of five glass bulbs, called a  ''[[Kaliapparat]]''  to trap the oxidation product of the carbon in the sample, following combustion of the sample. Before reaching the ''Kaliapparat'', the combustion gases were conducted through a tube of hygroscopic [[calcium chloride]], which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor.  Next, in the ''Kaliapparat'', [[carbon dioxide]] was absorbed in a [[potassium hydroxide]] solution in the three lower bulbs, and used to measure the weight of carbon in the sample.  For any substance consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the percentage of oxygen was found by subtracting the carbon and hydrogen percentages from 100%; the remainder must be the percentage of oxygen. A charcoal furnace (a sheet-steel tray in which the combustion tube was laid) was used for the combustion.<ref>{{Citation | last=Liebig |first=J. | title = Ueber einen neuen Apparat zur Analyse organischer K\u00f6rper, und \u00fcber die Zusammensetzung einiger organischen Substanzen | journal = Annalen der Physik | year = 1831 | volume = 21 |issue=1 | pages = 1\u201347 | doi=10.1002/andp.18310970102 |bibcode = 1831AnP....97....1L | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1423542 }}</ref> Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method's accuracy of measurement.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|48\u201351}}  Liebig's assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the ''Kaliapparat'', and demonstrated them to visitors.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|50}} Liebig's kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine.<ref name=Jackson>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Catherine M.|title=Synthetical Experiments and Alkaloid Analogues: Liebig, Hofmann, and the Origins of Organic Synthesis|journal=Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences|date=September 2014|volume=44|issue=4|pages=319\u2013363|doi=10.1525/hsns.2014.44.4.319|jstor=10.1525/hsns.2014.44.4.319}}</ref> Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|50}} His method of [[combustion analysis]] was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|76\u201377}}<ref name=Rochelle>{{cite web|last1=Forrester|first1=Rochelle|title=Organic chemistry in the nineteenth century|url=http://www.rochelleforrester.ac.nz/organic-chemistry.html|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nLiebig also popularized use of a counter-current water-cooling system for distillation, still referred to as a [[Liebig condenser]].<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|84}}  Liebig himself attributed the vapor condensation device to German pharmacist [[Johann Friedrich August Gottling]], who had made improvements in 1794 to a design discovered independently by German chemist [[Christian Ehrenfried Weigel]] in 1771, by French scientist, [[P.

After working with other scientists, [[Carl August von Steinheil]] approached Liebig in 1856 to see if he could develop a silvering technique capable of producing high-quality optical mirrors for use in [[reflecting telescopes]]. Liebig was able to develop blemish-free mirrors by adding copper to ammoniated silver nitrate and sugar.

The [[silver fulminate]] investigated by Liebig, was explosive, whereas the [[silver cyanate]] found by W\u00f6hler, was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid. The discovery of these and other substances led [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] to suggest the idea of [[isomers]], substances that are defined not simply by the number and kind of atoms in the molecule, but also by the arrangement of those atoms.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|72}}<ref name=LWControversy>{{cite journal|last1=Esteban|first1=Soledad|title=Liebig\u2013W\u00f6hler Controversy and the Concept of Isomerism|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=September 2008|volume=85|issue=9|pages=1201|doi=10.1021/ed085p1201|bibcode=2008JChEd..85.1201E}}<!--|accessdate=6 November 2014--></ref><ref name=LWCHF/>\n\nIn 1832, Liebig and Friedrich W\u00f6hler published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds.

Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging 30 papers per year between 1830 and 1840.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|76}} Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function.

It must be seen as not only probable, but as certain, that we shall be able to produce them in our laboratories.  Sugar, salicin, and morphine will be artificially produced.

Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of [[Karl Vogt]] (1817\u20131895), [[Jacob Moleschott]] (1822\u20131893), and [[Ludwig B\u00fcchner]] (1824\u20131899).{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Plant nutrition===\nBy the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability.  His book ''Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie'' (''Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology'') (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs. It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential.<ref name=Brock/>\n\nLiebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry. The first part of the book focused on plant nutrition, the second was on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|148}} Liebig's awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], promoting ideas such as the recycling of [[sewage]].<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|250\u2013270}}\n\nLiebig argued against prevalent theories about role of [[humus]] in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition. Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb. Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of \"vital force\" distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials.<ref name=Hill>{{cite book|author-last1=Hill|author-first1=Jane F.|chapter=Translator's Introduction|author-last2=de Saussure|author-first2=Theodore|title=Chemical research on plant growth|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-4136-6|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVVJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR15|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nEarly studies of photosynthesis had identified carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as important, but disagreed over their sources and mechanisms of action. Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water. Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water. Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xv-xxi}} [[Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure]]'s experiments, reported in ''Recherches Chimiques sur la V\u00e9g\u00e9tation'' (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources, and that water was a likely source of hydrogen. He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown. However, the implications of De Saussure's results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xxii-xxvii}}\n\nLiebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it.<ref name=Hill/>{{rp|xxix}} By the late 1830s, researchers such as [[Karl Sprengel]] were using Liebig's methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|106}} Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|148}}\n\nIn his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth. He reported that plants acquire carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H<sub>2</sub>O). In addition to emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air. This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|181}}\n\n[[File:Minimum-Tonne.svg|thumb|right|Liebig's barrel]]\nLiebig also popularized Carl Sprengel's \"theorem of minimum\" (known as the [[Liebig's Law of the Minimum|law of the minimum]]), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource.  A plant's development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply.  This concept of limitation can be visualized as \"Liebig's barrel\", a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element. A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level. This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture.\n\n''Organic Chemistry'' was not intended as a guide to practical agriculture. Liebig's lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism. Nonetheless, Liebig's writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|165}}\n\nOne of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of [[nitrogen]]-based [[fertilizer]]. In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that the atmosphere contained insufficient nitrogen, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|120}} Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of [[ammonia]], and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc.)\n\nHe later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years. An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|121\u2013124}} When tested in a farmer's field, Liebig's manure was found to have no appreciable effect.<ref>Matter-of-Fact (July 1847) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048680383&view=1up&seq=214 Liebig's System of Manuring], [[The Cultivator]] series 2, volume 4, page 208 via [[HathiTrust]]</ref>\n\nLiebig's difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized. By the publication of the seventh German edition of ''Agricultural Chemistry'' he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|179}} He was instrumental in the use of [[guano]] for nitrogen.<ref>Charles Mann (2011) [https://archive.org/details/1493uncoveringne00mann 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created], page 214, Knopf</ref>\nNitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry.<ref name=Travis2013>{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=Anthony S.|title=Dirty Business|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2013|volume=31|issue=1|page=7|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/dirty-business|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Plant and animal physiology===\nLiebig's work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential. By 1842, he had published ''Chimie organique appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la physiologie animale et \u00e0 la pathologie'', published in English as '' Animal Chemistry, or, Organic Chemistry in its Applications to Physiology and Pathology'', presenting a chemical theory of metabolism.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|185}} The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes.  Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter.  He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|184}}\n\nFrench researchers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and lacked the ability to synthesize them. Liebig's work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starches.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|187}} Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|189\u2013190}}\n\nLiebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the \"ingesta and excreta\" of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|191}}  He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|191\u2013193}} This proposed model was justifiably criticized. Berzelius stingingly stated that \"this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table\".<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|194}} Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research.  The third and last edition of ''Animal Chemistry'' (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|195\u2013197}} \n \nThe third area discussed in ''Animal Chemistry'' was fermentation and putrefaction. Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as [[Decomposition|eremacausis]] (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable \"affinities\" reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|205}}  Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body's \"chemical factory\", where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place. He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading contagion. Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had significant implications for doctors, sanitarians, and social reformers. The English medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' reviewed Liebig's work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|207}} Liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|214}}\n\nIn 1850, Liebig investigated [[spontaneous human combustion]], dismissing the simplistic explanations based on [[ethanol]] due to alcoholism.<ref name=Ford2012>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Brian J.|title=Solving the Mystery of Spontaneous Human Combustion|journal=The Microscope|year=2012|volume=60|issue=2|pages=63\u201372|url=http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231220/http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Liebig and the chemistry of food===\n\n====Methods of cookery====\nLiebig drew upon his work in plant nutrition and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had significant implications for cookery. In his ''Researches on the Chemistry of Food'' (1847) Liebig argued that eating not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals, was important. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded.  For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews).<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|217\u2013218}}\n\nLiebig was acclaimed in ''The Lancet'' for revealing \"the true principles of cookery\", and physicians promoted \"rational diets\" based on his ideas. Well-known British cookery writer [[Eliza Acton]] responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'', and subtitling the edition accordingly.<ref name=Brock/>{{rp|218\u2013219}}  Liebig's idea that \"[[searing]] meat seals in the juices\", though still widely believed, is not true.<ref name=McGee2004>{{cite book |chapter=The Searing Question | last=McGee |first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn=0-684-80001-2|page=161}}</ref>\n\n====Liebig's Extract of Meat Company====\n[[File:Liebig Company Memorial Trading Card 01.12.001 front.tif|thumb|right|upright|Memorial tradecard commemorating Justus von Liebig, from Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]]\n[[File:Liebig-Muenchen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Justus von Liebig statue, Munich, Germany]]\n\n{{Main|Liebig's Extract of Meat Company}}\n\nBuilding on his theories of the nutritional value of meat fluids, and seeking an inexpensive nutrition source for Europe's poor, Liebig developed a formula for producing beef extract.  The details were published in 1847 so that \"the benefit of it should ... be placed at the command of as large a number of persons as possible by the extension of the manufacture, and consequently a reduction in the cost\".<ref name=Quinologist>{{cite journal|editor-last1=Mattison|editor-first1=Richard V.|title=The Quinologist|year=1883|publisher=s.n.|location=Philadelphia|pages=55\u201358|volume=VI|number=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NADAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA55|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nProduction was not economically feasible in Europe, where meat was expensive, but in Uruguay and New South Wales, meat was an inexpensive byproduct of the leather industry. In 1865, Liebig partnered with Belgian engineer [[George Christian Giebert]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://negocios.elpais.com.uy/noticias/multinacional-liebig-fray-bentos.html |title=Liebig's in Fray Bentos|date=2 July 2018|work=[[El Pa\u00eds (Uruguay)|El Pa\u00eds]]|language=es}}</ref> and was named scientific director of the [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]], located in [[Fray Bentos]], Uruguay.<ref name=Cansler/><ref name=NickSkye>{{cite web|last1=Skye|first1=Nick|title=The Liebig chromolithographs, origins of bouillon, Marmite, Oxo and Campbell's soups|url=http://nickyskye.blogspot.com/2012/06/liebig-chromolithographs-part-1-origins.html|website=nickyskye meanderings|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=25 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther companies also attempted to market meat extracts under the name \"Liebig's Extract of Meat\".  In Britain, a competitor's right to use the name was successfully defended on the grounds that the name had fallen into general use and become a [[generic term]] before the creation of any particular company.<ref name=Quinologist/> The judge asserted that \"Purchasers must use their eyes\", and considered the presentation of the products to be sufficiently different to enable the discriminating consumer to determine which of the products bore Liebig's signature and was supported by Baron Liebig himself.<ref name=Quinologist2>{{cite journal|editor-last1=Mattison|editor-first1=Richard V.|title=The Quinologist|year=1883|publisher=s.n.|location=Philadelphia|pages=184\u2013186|volume=VI|number=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NADAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA184|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nLiebig's company initially promoted their \"meat tea\" for its curative powers and nutritional value as a cheap, nutritious alternative to real meat.

German cookery writer [[Henriette Davidis]] wrote recipes for ''Improved and Economic Cookery'' and other cookbooks.   [[Katherina Prato]] wrote an Austro-Hungarian recipe book, ''Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte'' (1879). [[Hannah M. Young]] was commissioned in England to write ''Practical Cookery Book'' for the Liebig Company. In the United States, [[Maria Parloa]] extolled the benefits of Liebig's extract. Colorful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product.<ref name=\"Brock\"/>{{rp|234\u2013237}}\n\nThe company also worked with British chemist [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] to develop a related product, which it registered some years after Liebig's death, under the \"[[Oxo (food)|Oxo]]\" trademark. Oxo was trademarked worldwide in 1899 and in the United Kingdom in 1900. Originally a liquid, Oxo was released in cubed solid form in 1911.<ref name=\"Brock\"/>{{rp|230}}\n\n====Marmite====\nLiebig studied other foods, as well. He promoted the use of baking powder to make lighter bread, studied the chemistry of coffee-making, and developed a breast-milk substitute for babies who could not suckle.<ref name=\"Brock\"/>{{rp|238\u2013248}} He is considered to have made possible the invention of [[Marmite]], because of his discovery that yeast could be concentrated.<ref name=Boulton>{{cite book|editor-last1=Boulton|editor-first1=Chris|title=Encyclopedia of brewing|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-1-4051-6744-4|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&pg=PA394|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Major works ==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=51763678 }}\n\nLiebig founded the journal ''[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie]]'', which he edited from 1832.

Through Liebig's close friendship with the Vieweg family publishing house, he arranged for his former student [[Jacob Schiel]] (1813\u20131889) to translate Mill's important work for German publication. Liebig liked Mill's ''Logic'' in part because it promoted science as a means to social and political progress, but also because Mill featured several examples of Liebig's research as an ideal for the scientific method.
