Please bring up on the talk page if you feel differently - before adding the genre.  --> developed by 2K Boston (later [[Irrational Games]]) and [[2K Australia]], and published by [[2K Games]]. It is the first game in the [[BioShock (series)|''Bioshock'' series]]. The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], and incorporates ideas by 20th century [[dystopian]] and [[utopian]] thinkers such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[George Orwell]], and [[Aldous Huxley]], as well as historical figures such as [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Walt Disney]]. The game is considered a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[System Shock]]'' series, on which many of Irrational's team, including Levine, had worked previously.\n\n''BioShock'' is set in 1960. The player guides the protagonist, Jack, after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the [[bathysphere]] terminus that leads to the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. Built by the [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]], while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, can defeat foes in several ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's defenses against them. it was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] platforms in August 2007; a [[PlayStation 3]] port by Irrational, [[2K Marin]], [[2K Australia]] and [[Digital Extremes]] was released in October 2008, and an [[OS X]] port by [[Feral Interactive]] in October 2009. A scaled-down mobile version was developed by IG Fun, which contained the first few levels of the game.\n\n''BioShock'' includes elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by [[Stealth game|stealth]], as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters. Additionally, the game and [[biopunk]] theme borrow concepts from the [[survival horror]] genre, notably the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series.\n\n''BioShock'' received critical acclaim and was particularly praised by critics for its [[morality]]-based storyline, immersive environments, and its unique setting. It is considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] and a demonstration of [[video games as an art form|video game as an art form]]. It received several ''Game of the Year'' awards from different media outlets, including from [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], ''[[Game Informer]]'', [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]], and ''[[X-Play]]''.\n\nSince its release a direct sequel has been released, ''[[BioShock 2]]'' by 2K Marin, as well as a third game titled ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' by Irrational Games. A remastered version of the original game was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in September 2016, as part of ''[[BioShock: The Collection]]'', along with ''BioShock 2'' and ''Infinite''. A standalone version of ''BioShock Remastered'' was released for [[macOS]] by Feral Interactive in August 2017. Releases of both the standalone remastered version along with ''The Collection'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]] are set for release in May 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''BioShock'' is set in 1960 in the underwater city of Rapture; the city's history is mostly revealed via audio recordings the player can collect during the game.<ref name=\"bit-tech\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |title=Xbox Preview: BioShock |publisher=CVG |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116175332/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref> Rapture was planned and constructed in the 1940s by [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] who wanted to create a [[utopia]] for society's elite to flourish outside of government control and \"petty morality\". Scientific progress greatly expanded, including the discovery of the genetic material \"ADAM\" created by [[sea slug]]s on the ocean floor. ADAM allows its users to alter their DNA to grant them super-human powers like [[telekinesis]] and [[pyrokinesis]]. To protect Rapture, Ryan imposed a law that no contact with the surface world was allowed.<ref name=\"John 18\u201320\">{{cite journal|last=John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201320 |doi= |access-date=October 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005125352/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |archivedate=October 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence over the lower class to plan a coup over Rapture. Fontaine profited by creating black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implantation of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed \"Little Sisters\".  Fontaine used his plasmid-enhanced army to attack Ryan, but reportedly was killed in the battle. Ryan took the opportunity to seize his assets, including the plasmid factories. In the months that followed, a second figure named Atlas rose to speak for the lower class, creating further strife. Atlas led attacks on the factories housing the Little Sisters, and Ryan countered by creating \"Big Daddies\", plasmid-enhanced humans surgically grafted into giant lumbering diving suits who were psychologically compelled to protect the Little Sisters at all costs.<ref name=\"bit-tech\" /> Ryan also created his army of plasmid-enhanced soldiers, named \"Splicers\", which he controlled using pheromones distributed through Rapture's air system.\n\nTension came to a head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas ordered an all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane survivors barricaded themselves away.

Steinman or [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Sander Cohen|Sander Cohen]], a former musician and art dealer who now [[Schadenfreude|takes enjoyment]] in watching the death and misery of others.\n\nEventually, Jack enters Ryan's office, where Ryan is patiently waiting for Jack by casually playing golf. Ryan explains he fully knew of Atlas' plan, and explains that Jack is his illegitimate child, taken from his mother by Fontaine who placed him out of Ryan's reach on the surface, and genetically modified to age rapidly. Fontaine had planned to use Jack as a trump card in his war with Ryan, bringing him back to Rapture when the time was right; Jack's genetics would allow him to access systems such as the bathysphere that Ryan had locked out long ago. With no place to run, Ryan is willing to accept death by his own free will, quoting one of his principles: \"A man chooses. A slave obeys.\" He asks Jack \"would you kindly\" kill him with the golf club, and Jack is compelled to do so.<ref name=\"vox sept2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/3/13112826/bioshock-video-games-art-choice |title=Bioshock proved that video games could be art |first=Peter |last=Suderman |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003194002/http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/3/13112826/bioshock-video-games-art-choice |archivedate=October 3, 2016 }}</ref> As Ryan dies, Jack becomes aware that the phrase \"would you kindly\" has preceded many of Atlas' commands as a hypnotic trigger forcing him to follow Atlas' orders without question; a flashback reveals Jack himself was responsible for crashing his plane near the lighthouse after reading a letter containing the trigger phrase. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having used the Atlas alias to hide his identity while providing a figure for the lower class to rally behind. Without Ryan, Fontaine takes over control of Ryan's systems and leaves Jack to die as he releases hostile security drones into Ryan's locked office.\n\nJack is saved by Dr. Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters who had previously been rescued. Dr. Tenenbaum helps Jack to remove Fontaine's conditioned responses, including one that would have stopped his heart. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack makes his way to Fontaine's lair to face him. Fontaine, being cornered by Jack, injects himself with a large amount of ADAM, becoming an inhuman monster. The Little Sisters aid Jack in draining the ADAM in Fontaine's body and eventually killing him.\n\nThe ending depends on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters:\n*If the player rescues ''all'' of the Little Sisters (or harvests only one of them), Jack takes them back to the surface with him and adopts five of them as his daughters, and Tenenbaum happily narrates how they go on to live full lives under his care, eventually surrounding him on his deathbed.

The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects multiple weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types that can be used instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage.

He saw the uniqueness of the [[art deco]] styling of the building along with imagery around the building such as the [[Atlas (statue)|statue of Atlas]] near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been experienced in the first-player shooter genre.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The history of the Rockefeller Center also fed into the story concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1920s; when the primary financiers had pulled out, [[John D. Rockefeller]] backed the remaining construction to complete the project himself, as stated by ''Edge'' magazine \"a great man building an architectural triumph against all the odds\".<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The history of Rapture and the character of Andrew Ryan is loosely based on Rockefeller's story.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> He also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in their lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt resonated throughout human history.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/>\n\nAt this point in the development, the backdrop of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of ''[[Night Trap]]''.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including [[Ayn Rand]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[George Orwell]], and considered their ideas \"fascinating\".<ref name=\"ign myths\">{{cite web|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames |first=Douglass C. |last=Perry |publisher=IGN |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104025910/http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}</ref> He brought in the ideas of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] that Rand primarily outlined in the book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their benefit.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game \"where the player gets punished for doing the right thing\".<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this \"a massive kludge\" into the game's fiction.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/><ref name=\"edge history\"/> The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the broader gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters \"much more ambiguous\", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/> Levine also noted that \"it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |title=Q&A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |publisher=Gamespot |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011144853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |archivedate=October 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOther elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in \"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around <nowiki>[it]</nowiki>\".<ref name=\"ign myths\"/> Regarding artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have \"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |title=Big Daddy speaks |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Johnny |last=Minkley |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821030637/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}</ref> The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon \"Would you kindly\" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \"Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?\", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/>\n\nNumerous tensions within the team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful of some of the more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of ''BioShock''.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role playing game hybrid they set out for.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that he was in charge of at that time.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> This left some hard-to-discover bugs and issues in the game undiscovered. One such case was an apparent [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] found in the remastered version in 2018, where under certain conditions, the player can end up looking at an object with the description \"Paul Hellquist did not do his Job\". Both Levine and Chris Kline, the game's lead programmer confirmed the message was a cheeky jab at Hellquist left as a debugging message; Kline and Hellquist were developing the systems to show descriptions of objects to players when looked at, and Hellquist offered to complete all the necessary descriptions in-game; to jokingly help prod Hellquist along, Kline put \"Paul Hellquist did not do his Job\" as the default message within the executable code. While the code message was changed for the original release, the remastered version likely used a pre-final version of the ''BioShock'' code, according to Kline.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/bioshock-developer-confirms-that-obscure-easter-egg-debug-message-is-real/ | title = BioShock developer confirms that obscure Easter egg debug message is real | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = January 9, 2018 | accessdate = January 9, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180109235001/http://www.pcgamer.com/bioshock-developer-confirms-that-obscure-easter-egg-debug-message-is-real/ | archive-date = January 9, 2018 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Hellquist took the revelation in good humor and tweeted that other Easter eggs should have been added to the game to display, \"If you are enjoying this, Paul Hellquist did his job.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/obscure-hidden-message-in-bioshock-re-surfaces-a-decade-after-release/ |title=Obscure Hidden Message In BioShock Re-Surfaces A Decade After Release |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110044506/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/obscure-hidden-message-in-bioshock-re-surfaces-a-decade-after-release/ |archive-date=January 10, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nA critical playtest of the game occurred in January 2007, where initial feedback from the players was mostly negative, including issues of the setting being too dark, having no idea where to go, and distrusting Atlas, who at the time was voiced in a southern drawl, described as a \"lecherous Colonel Sanders\".<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> The team took this criticism to heart, revamping several elements during those extra months such as improving the lighting, implementing a quest marker, and using an Irish voice for Atlas to make him sound more trustworthy.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> During another late-stage playtest with the title \"ninety-nine percent\" complete according to Levine, the playtesters did not like the game at all as they felt no connection to the player-character Jack, and the person overseeing the tests told Levine that the game was likely to be a failure. At this point, ''BioShock'' did not have many cutscenes, as Levine was ideologically opposed to them. However, the following day, Levine and the lead group came up with a \"cheap\" way to correct this, by adding the initial cut scene within the plane and the subsequent plane crash, as this helped to set the time frame, place the player in the role of the character, and alluded to the \"would you kindly\" line later in the game.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |title=Inside the Making of 'BioShock' Series With Creator Ken Levine |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=September 14, 2016 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112859/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |archivedate=September 16, 2016 }}</ref> Levine likened this approach to the initial aircraft crash at the onset of the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' to quickly establish character and setting.<ref name=\"edge history\"/>\n\nThe game was successfully released in August 2007 with a final budget of about $25 million.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> In a 2016 interview, Levine felt that the game could have used about six more months of development to improve the gun combat system and fix lagging issues that occurred during the final boss fight.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/> Despite the critical success of the title, many of those on the team would leave Irrational to pursue other projects due to late development strife that occurred.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/>\n\nIn an interview in 2018, Levine had come to recognize that ''BioShock'' reflected several [[Jews|Jewish]] themes, though this was not intentional.

Please bring up on the talk page if you feel differently - before adding the genre.  --> developed by 2K Boston (later [[Irrational Games]]) and [[2K Australia]], and published by [[2K Games]]. It is the first game in the [[BioShock (series)|''Bioshock'' series]]. The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], and incorporates ideas by 20th century [[dystopian]] and [[utopian]] thinkers such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[George Orwell]], and [[Aldous Huxley]], as well as historical figures such as [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Walt Disney]]. The game is considered a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[System Shock]]'' series, on which many of Irrational's team, including Levine, had worked previously.\n\n''BioShock'' is set in 1960. The player guides the protagonist, Jack, after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the [[bathysphere]] terminus that leads to the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. Built by the [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]], while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, can defeat foes in several ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's defenses against them. it was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] platforms in August 2007; a [[PlayStation 3]] port by Irrational, [[2K Marin]], [[2K Australia]] and [[Digital Extremes]] was released in October 2008, and an [[OS X]] port by [[Feral Interactive]] in October 2009. A scaled-down mobile version was developed by IG Fun, which contained the first few levels of the game.\n\n''BioShock'' includes elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by [[Stealth game|stealth]], as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters. Additionally, the game and [[biopunk]] theme borrow concepts from the [[survival horror]] genre, notably the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series.\n\n''BioShock'' received critical acclaim and was particularly praised by critics for its [[morality]]-based storyline, immersive environments, and its unique setting. It is considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] and a demonstration of [[video games as an art form|video game as an art form]]. It received several ''Game of the Year'' awards from different media outlets, including from [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], ''[[Game Informer]]'', [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]], and ''[[X-Play]]''.\n\nSince its release a direct sequel has been released, ''[[BioShock 2]]'' by 2K Marin, as well as a third game titled ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' by Irrational Games. A remastered version of the original game was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in September 2016, as part of ''[[BioShock: The Collection]]'', along with ''BioShock 2'' and ''Infinite''. A standalone version of ''BioShock Remastered'' was released for [[macOS]] by Feral Interactive in August 2017. Releases of both the standalone remastered version along with ''The Collection'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]] are set for release in May 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''BioShock'' is set in 1960 in the underwater city of Rapture; the city's history is mostly revealed via audio recordings the player can collect during the game.<ref name=\"bit-tech\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |title=Xbox Preview: BioShock |publisher=CVG |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116175332/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref> Rapture was planned and constructed in the 1940s by [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] who wanted to create a [[utopia]] for society's elite to flourish outside of government control and \"petty morality\". Scientific progress greatly expanded, including the discovery of the genetic material \"ADAM\" created by [[sea slug]]s on the ocean floor. ADAM allows its users to alter their DNA to grant them super-human powers like [[telekinesis]] and [[pyrokinesis]]. To protect Rapture, Ryan imposed a law that no contact with the surface world was allowed.<ref name=\"John 18\u201320\">{{cite journal|last=John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201320 |doi= |access-date=October 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005125352/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |archivedate=October 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence over the lower class to plan a coup over Rapture. Fontaine profited by creating black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implantation of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed \"Little Sisters\".  Fontaine used his plasmid-enhanced army to attack Ryan, but reportedly was killed in the battle. Ryan took the opportunity to seize his assets, including the plasmid factories. In the months that followed, a second figure named Atlas rose to speak for the lower class, creating further strife. Atlas led attacks on the factories housing the Little Sisters, and Ryan countered by creating \"Big Daddies\", plasmid-enhanced humans surgically grafted into giant lumbering diving suits who were psychologically compelled to protect the Little Sisters at all costs.<ref name=\"bit-tech\" /> Ryan also created his army of plasmid-enhanced soldiers, named \"Splicers\", which he controlled using pheromones distributed through Rapture's air system.\n\nTension came to a head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas ordered an all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane survivors barricaded themselves away.

Ryan explains he fully knew of Atlas' plan, and explains that Jack is his illegitimate child, taken from his mother by Fontaine who placed him out of Ryan's reach on the surface, and genetically modified to age rapidly. Fontaine had planned to use Jack as a trump card in his war with Ryan, bringing him back to Rapture when the time was right; Jack's genetics would allow him to access systems such as the bathysphere that Ryan had locked out long ago.

Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having used the Atlas alias to hide his identity while providing a figure for the lower class to rally behind. Without Ryan, Fontaine takes over control of Ryan's systems and leaves Jack to die as he releases hostile security drones into Ryan's locked office.\n\nJack is saved by Dr. Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters who had previously been rescued. Dr. Tenenbaum helps Jack to remove Fontaine's conditioned responses, including one that would have stopped his heart. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack makes his way to Fontaine's lair to face him. Fontaine, being cornered by Jack, injects himself with a large amount of ADAM, becoming an inhuman monster. The Little Sisters aid Jack in draining the ADAM in Fontaine's body and eventually killing him.\n\nThe ending depends on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters:\n*If the player rescues ''all'' of the Little Sisters (or harvests only one of them), Jack takes them back to the surface with him and adopts five of them as his daughters, and Tenenbaum happily narrates how they go on to live full lives under his care, eventually surrounding him on his deathbed.

He saw the uniqueness of the [[art deco]] styling of the building along with imagery around the building such as the [[Atlas (statue)|statue of Atlas]] near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been experienced in the first-player shooter genre.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The history of the Rockefeller Center also fed into the story concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1920s; when the primary financiers had pulled out, [[John D. Rockefeller]] backed the remaining construction to complete the project himself, as stated by ''Edge'' magazine \"a great man building an architectural triumph against all the odds\".<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The history of Rapture and the character of Andrew Ryan is loosely based on Rockefeller's story.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> He also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in their lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt resonated throughout human history.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/>\n\nAt this point in the development, the backdrop of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of ''[[Night Trap]]''.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including [[Ayn Rand]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[George Orwell]], and considered their ideas \"fascinating\".<ref name=\"ign myths\">{{cite web|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames |first=Douglass C. |last=Perry |publisher=IGN |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104025910/http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}</ref> He brought in the ideas of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] that Rand primarily outlined in the book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their benefit.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game \"where the player gets punished for doing the right thing\".<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this \"a massive kludge\" into the game's fiction.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/><ref name=\"edge history\"/> The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the broader gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets.<ref name=\"edge history\"/> Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters \"much more ambiguous\", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/> Levine also noted that \"it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |title=Q&A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |publisher=Gamespot |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011144853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |archivedate=October 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOther elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in \"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around <nowiki>[it]</nowiki>\".<ref name=\"ign myths\"/> Regarding artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have \"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |title=Big Daddy speaks |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Johnny |last=Minkley |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821030637/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}</ref> The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon \"Would you kindly\" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \"Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?\", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/>\n\nNumerous tensions within the team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful of some of the more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of ''BioShock''.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role playing game hybrid they set out for.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that he was in charge of at that time.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> This left some hard-to-discover bugs and issues in the game undiscovered. One such case was an apparent [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] found in the remastered version in 2018, where under certain conditions, the player can end up looking at an object with the description \"Paul Hellquist did not do his Job\". Both Levine and Chris Kline, the game's lead programmer confirmed the message was a cheeky jab at Hellquist left as a debugging message; Kline and Hellquist were developing the systems to show descriptions of objects to players when looked at, and Hellquist offered to complete all the necessary descriptions in-game; to jokingly help prod Hellquist along, Kline put \"Paul Hellquist did not do his Job\" as the default message within the executable code.

At this point, ''BioShock'' did not have many cutscenes, as Levine was ideologically opposed to them. However, the following day, Levine and the lead group came up with a \"cheap\" way to correct this, by adding the initial cut scene within the plane and the subsequent plane crash, as this helped to set the time frame, place the player in the role of the character, and alluded to the \"would you kindly\" line later in the game.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |title=Inside the Making of 'BioShock' Series With Creator Ken Levine |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=September 14, 2016 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112859/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |archivedate=September 16, 2016 }}</ref> Levine likened this approach to the initial aircraft crash at the onset of the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' to quickly establish character and setting.<ref name=\"edge history\"/>\n\nThe game was successfully released in August 2007 with a final budget of about $25 million.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/> In a 2016 interview, Levine felt that the game could have used about six more months of development to improve the gun combat system and fix lagging issues that occurred during the final boss fight.<ref name=\"glixel sept2016\"/> Despite the critical success of the title, many of those on the team would leave Irrational to pursue other projects due to late development strife that occurred.<ref name=\"eurogamer truestory\"/>\n\nIn an interview in 2018, Levine had come to recognize that ''BioShock'' reflected several [[Jews|Jewish]] themes, though this was not intentional.

Levine stated that after Warner's ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the ''BioShock'' film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this.<ref name=\"eurogamer film\"/> In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew was about eight weeks from starting filming,<ref name=\"ign film 8 weeks\"/> with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rating]] when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film.<ref name=\"film ama\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14635490/bioshock-director-deadpool |title=BioShock film could have been made today, director says |first=Julia |last=Alexander |date=February 16, 2017 |accessdate=February 16, 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216202222/http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14635490/bioshock-director-deadpool |archivedate=February 16, 2017 }}</ref> Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material.
