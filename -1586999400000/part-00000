After the [[CSNY 1974|1974 stadium tour]] with [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and another abandoned attempt at the second CSNY studio album, Young formed a new version of Crazy Horse in 1975 with guitarist [[Frank Sampedro]] slotted in alongside Talbot and Molina.

According to these accounts, during the lifetime of [[Nahor, son of Serug|Nahor]] (Abraham's grandfather), a certain Canaanite named [[Armonius]] had two sons named Sodom and Gomorrah, for whom he named two newly built towns, naming a third (Zoara) after their mother.\n\nZoara is not mentioned in the [[Ebla tablets]] though there has also been some [[conjecture]] that [[Admah]], with which it biblically tied, is mentioned in the [[Ebla tablets]].<ref> Thomas O'Toole, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/12/09/ebla-tablets-no-biblical-claims/89f81380-1350-415a-b836-570cfec84b68/  Ebla Tablets: No Biblical Claims]  [[Washington Post]]December 9, 1979 </ref>\n\n==Archaeology==\nPrior to the major archaeological excavations in the 1980s and 1990s that took place in Zoara, scholars proposed that several sites in the area of Khirbet Sheikh 'Isa and al-Naq' offered further evidence of Zoara's location and history. Further information regarding Zoara in different historical epochs were obtained through the descriptions of Arabian geographers, suggesting that Zoara served as an important station in the [[Aqaba]]-to-Jericho trade route, and through Eusebius' statement that the Dead Sea was situated between Zoar and Jericho. Researchers who have studied ancient texts portray Zoara as a town erected in the middle of a flourishing oasis, watered by rivers flowing down from the high Moab Mountains in the east. The sweet dates that grew abundantly on the palm trees surrounding Zoara are also mentioned in some historical texts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSeveral excavation surveys have been conducted in this area in the years 1986-1996. Ruins of a basilical church that were discovered in the site of Deir 'Ain 'Abata (\"Monastery at the Abata Spring\" in Arabic), were identified as the Sanctuary of Agios (Saint) Lot. An adjacent cave is ascribed as the location where Lot and his daughters took refuge during the destruction of Sodom. About 300 engraved funerary steles in the Khirbet Sheikh 'Isa area in [[Ghor as-Safi]] were found in 1995. Most gravestones were inscribed in Greek and thus attributed to Christian burials, while several stones were inscribed in Aramaic, suggesting that they belong to Jewish burials. Of these, two inscriptions reveal the origins of the deceased as being Jews that hailed from [[Himyarite Kingdom|\u1e24imyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) and are funerary inscriptions dating back to 470 and 477 A.D., written in the combined [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean script]]s. In one of them it was noted that the deceased was brought from [[Zafar, Yemen|\u1e92af\u0101r]], the capital of the Kingdom of \u1e24imyar, to be buried in Zoar.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Naveh |first=Joseph |title=Aramaic Tombstones from Zoar |journal= Tarbi\u1e95  (Hebrew) |volume= |issue=64|pages= 477\u2013497 |jstor= 23599945|date=1995}};  {{cite journal |last=Naveh |first=Joseph |title=Seven New Epitaphs from Zoar |journal= Tarbi\u1e95  (Hebrew) |volume= |issue= 69|pages= 619\u2013636 |jstor= 23600873 |date=2000}}; Joseph Naveh, ''A Bi-Lingual Tomb Inscription from Sheba'', Journal: ''Leshonenu'' (issue 65), 2003, pp. 117\u2013120 (Hebrew); G.W.

According to these accounts, during the lifetime of [[Nahor, son of Serug|Nahor]] (Abraham's grandfather), a certain Canaanite named [[Armonius]] had two sons named Sodom and Gomorrah, for whom he named two newly built towns, naming a third (Zoara) after their mother.\n\nZoara is not mentioned in the [[Ebla tablets]] though there has also been some [[conjecture]] that [[Admah]], with which it biblically tied, is mentioned in the [[Ebla tablets]].<ref> Thomas O'Toole, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/12/09/ebla-tablets-no-biblical-claims/89f81380-1350-415a-b836-570cfec84b68/  Ebla Tablets: No Biblical Claims]  [[Washington Post]]December 9, 1979 </ref>\n\n==Archaeology==\nPrior to the major archaeological excavations in the 1980s and 1990s that took place in Zoara, scholars proposed that several sites in the area of Khirbet Sheikh 'Isa and al-Naq' offered further evidence of Zoara's location and history. Further information regarding Zoara in different historical epochs were obtained through the descriptions of Arabian geographers, suggesting that Zoara served as an important station in the [[Aqaba]]-to-Jericho trade route, and through Eusebius' statement that the Dead Sea was situated between Zoar and Jericho. Researchers who have studied ancient texts portray Zoara as a town erected in the middle of a flourishing oasis, watered by rivers flowing down from the high Moab Mountains in the east. The sweet dates that grew abundantly on the palm trees surrounding Zoara are also mentioned in some historical texts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSeveral excavation surveys have been conducted in this area in the years 1986-1996. Ruins of a basilical church that were discovered in the site of Deir 'Ain 'Abata (\"Monastery at the Abata Spring\" in Arabic), were identified as the Sanctuary of Agios (Saint) Lot. An adjacent cave is ascribed as the location where Lot and his daughters took refuge during the destruction of Sodom. About 300 engraved funerary steles in the Khirbet Sheikh 'Isa area in [[Ghor as-Safi]] were found in 1995. Most gravestones were inscribed in Greek and thus attributed to Christian burials, while several stones were inscribed in Aramaic, suggesting that they belong to Jewish burials. Of these, two inscriptions reveal the origins of the deceased as being Jews that hailed from [[Himyarite Kingdom|\u1e24imyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) and are funerary inscriptions dating back to 470 and 477 A.D., written in the combined [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean script]]s. In one of them it was noted that the deceased was brought from [[Zafar, Yemen|\u1e92af\u0101r]], the capital of the Kingdom of \u1e24imyar, to be buried in Zoar.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Naveh |first=Joseph |title=Aramaic Tombstones from Zoar |journal= Tarbi\u1e95  (Hebrew) |volume= |issue=64|pages= 477\u2013497 |jstor= 23599945|date=1995}};  {{cite journal |last=Naveh |first=Joseph |title=Seven New Epitaphs from Zoar |journal= Tarbi\u1e95  (Hebrew) |volume= |issue= 69|pages= 619\u2013636 |jstor= 23600873 |date=2000}}; Joseph Naveh, ''A Bi-Lingual Tomb Inscription from Sheba'', Journal: ''Leshonenu'' (issue 65), 2003, pp. 117\u2013120 (Hebrew); G.W.

After their 8th century conquest of nearly all of [[Hispania]], which they renamed [[Al-Andalus]], the Muslims were a small minority for quite some time, greatly outnumbered by the majority Christians and a smaller community of Jews, who had their own styles of music. With their arrival, the Muslims and Arabs introduced new styles of music, and the main cities of Iberia soon became well known centers for music within the Islamic world.<ref name=Marin/> During the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to Iberia. While many were talented, Ziryab surpassed them all.<ref name=Menocal/>\n\nZiryab was most likely born in Baghdad{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, though Arab sources<ref>[[:ar:\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0628]]{{Better source|date=January 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> say he was born in Mosul and was trained in the art of music from a young age. During that time, Baghdad was an important center of music in the Muslim world. The sources all agree that the accomplished and talented musician Ishaq al-Mawsili was Ziryab's teacher. There is some debate about how he arrived in al-Andalus, but he may have offended his patron or some powerful figure with his musical talent.<ref name=Constable>{{Citation|title=Medieval Iberia|editor=Constable, Olivia Remie|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nOne account recorded by [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]] says that Ziryab inspired the jealousy of his mentor by giving an impressive performance for the caliph Harun al-Rashid (d. 809), with the result that al-Mawsili told him to leave the city.<ref name=Marin/><ref name=Menocal>{{Citation|title=The Literature of Al-Andalus|editor=Menocal, Mar\u00eda Rosa|editor2=Raymond P.

He then traveled first to ([[Syria]]), then to Ifriqiya ([[Tunisia]]), where he lived at the [[Aghlabid]] court of [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya|Ziyadat Allah]] (ruled 816\u2013837).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Language of the Heart|last=Epstein|first=Joel|publisher=KDP|year=2019|isbn=978-1070100906|location=https://www.amazon.com/Language-Heart-musical-fantastical-journey/dp/1070100900|pages=234 - 237}}</ref> Ziryab fell out with Ziyadat Allah but was invited to [[Al-Andalus]] by the Umayyad prince, [[Al-Hakam I]] (ruled 796\u2013822). He found on arrival in 822 that the prince had died, but the prince's son, [[Abd ar-Rahman II]], renewed his father's invitation.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/> Ziryab settled in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] he was honored a monthly salary of 200 Gold [[Dinars]], he soon became even more celebrated as the court's aficionado of food, fashion, singing and music. He introduced standards of excellence in all these fields as well as setting new norms for elegant and noble manners. Ziryab became such a prominent cultural figure, and was given a huge salary from Abd al Rahman II.<ref name=Menocal/> He was an intimate companion of the prince and established a school of music that trained singers and musicians which influenced musical performance for at least two generations after him.\n\nAl-Maqqari states in his ''Nafh al-Tib'' (Fragrant Breeze): \"There never was, either before or after him (Ziryab), a man of his profession who was more generally beloved and admired\".\n\n===Music===\nZiryab is said to have improved the [[Oud]] (or [[La\u00fad]]) by adding a fifth pair of strings, and using an eagle's beak or quill instead of a wooden pick. Ziryab also dyed the four strings a color to symbolize the Aristotelian humors, and the fifth string to represent the soul.<ref name=Marin/> He is said to have created a unique and influential style of musical performance, and written songs that were performed in Iberia for generations. He was a great influence on Spanish music, and is considered the founder of the [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian music]] traditions of North Africa.\n\nZiryab's Baghdadi musical style became very popular in the court of Abd al-Rahman II.<ref name=Constable/> Ziryab also became the example of how a courtier, a person who attended aristocratic courts, should act. According to Ibn Hayyan, in common with erudite men of his time he was well versed in many areas of classical study such as astronomy, history, and geography.\n\nAccording to al-Tifashi, Ziryab appears to have popularized an early song-sequence, which may have been a precursor to the nawba (originally simply a performer's \"turn\" to perform for the prince), or [[Andalusi nubah|Nuba]], which is known today as the classical Arabic music of North Africa, though the connections are tenuous at best.\n\nAbd al-Rahman II was a great patron of the arts and Ziryab was given a great deal of freedom. He established one of the first schools of music in C\u00f3rdoba. This school incorporated both male and female students, who were very popular amongst the aristocracy of the time.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/> According to Ibn Hayyan, Ziryab developed various tests for them. If a student didn't have a large vocal capacity, for instance, he would put pieces of wood in their jaw to force them to hold their mouth open. Or he would tie a sash tightly around the waist to make them breathe in a particular way, and he would test incoming students by having them sing as loudly and as long a note as they possibly could to see whether they had lung capacity.\n\n===Family===\nAccording to the main source, Ibn Hayyan, Ziryab had eight sons and two daughters. Five of the sons and both daughters became musicians of some prominence.<ref name=Menocal/> These children kept their father's music school alive, but the female slave singers he trained also were regarded as reliable sources for his repertoire in the following generation.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/>\n\n===Fashion and hygiene===\nZiryab started a vogue by changing clothes according to the weather and season.<ref name=Menocal/> He suggested different clothing for mornings, afternoons and evenings. Henri Terrasse, a French historian of North Africa, commented that legend attributes winter and summer clothing styles and \"the luxurious dress of the Orient\" found in Morocco today to Ziryab, but argues that \"Without a doubt, a lone man could not achieve this transformation. It is rather a development which shook the Muslim world in general&nbsp;...\"<ref>Terrasse, H. (1958) 'Islam d'Espagne' une rencontre de l'Orient et de l'Occident\", Librairie Plon, Paris, pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nHe created a new type of deodorant to get rid of bad odors<ref name=Menocal/> and also promoted morning and evening baths and emphasized the maintenance of personal hygiene. Ziryab is thought to have invented an early [[toothpaste]], which he popularized throughout [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]]. The exact ingredients of this toothpaste are not currently known, but it was reported to have been both \"functional and pleasant to taste\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robert W. |first1=Lebling Jr. |title=Flight of the Blackbird |url=https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200304/flight.of.the.blackbird.htm |website=Saudi Aramco World}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Al-Maqqari before the arrival of Ziryab, all the people of al-Andalus, in the Cordoban court, wore their long hair parted in the middle and hung down loose down to the shoulders, men and women; Ziryab had his hair cut with bangs down to his eyebrows and straight across his forehead, \"new short hairstyles leaving the neck, ears and eyebrows free,\".<ref name=Marin>Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Manuela Marin (1994), ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'', p. 117, Brill Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-09599-3}}</ref> He popularized [[shaving]] among men and set new [[haircut]] trends.

Whether introducing new clothes, styles, foods, hygiene products, or music, Ziryab changed Andalusian culture forever. The musical contributions of Ziryab alone are staggering, laying the early groundwork for classic Spanish music.

According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', he was born around 175 AH/790 CE into a family of [[mawali]] of the caliph [[al-Mahdi]].<ref name=\"brill\">{{cite journal|last1=H.G.|first1=Farmer|last2=E.|first2=Neubauer|title=ZIRY\u0100B|publisher=Brill|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_sim_8172}}</ref> His ethnic origin is disputed, different sources list him as either [[Persian people|Persian]]<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ziryab, \u201cZiry\u0101b\nPERSIAN MUSICIAN\u201d</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xVMJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT208&lpg=PT208&dq=ziryab+persian+a+history+of+medieval+spain#v=onepage&q=ziryab%20persian%20a%20history%20of%20medieval%20spain&f=false|title=A History of Medieval Spain|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801468711|language=en|quote=\"The most influential courtier was the musician Ziryab, a Persian, who had held high position in the court at Baghdad\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Monroe |first=James T. |title=Hispano-Arabic poetry: a student anthology |publisher=Gorgias Press LLC |date=30 January 2004 |quote=Modernism had been brought from the court of Harun ar-Rashid by Ziryab, the Persian singer who became an arbiter&nbsp;...}}</ref>, [[Arab]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}, [[Kurds|Kurdish]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|last2=Yassin-Kassab|first2=Robin|title=Critical Muslim 06: Reclaiming Al-Andalus|date=2013|publisher=Hurst|isbn=9781849043830|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0X71AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=Ziryab+kurdish#v=onepage&q=Ziryab%20kurdish&f=false|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge Scholars Publishing\"/>   or African.<ref name=\"Cambridge Scholars Publishing\">{{cite book|last1=Grajter|first1=Ma\u0142gorzata|title=The Orient in Music - Music of the Orient|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781527510265|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IvlVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=Ziryab+ethnic+black#v=snippet&q=Zaryab%20%22freed%20African%22&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Historical context/early life==\nAs the Islamic armies conquered more and more territories, their musical culture spread with them, as far as western China in the east and Iberia in the west. After their 8th century conquest of nearly all of [[Hispania]], which they renamed [[Al-Andalus]], the Muslims were a small minority for quite some time, greatly outnumbered by the majority Christians and a smaller community of Jews, who had their own styles of music. With their arrival, the Muslims and Arabs introduced new styles of music, and the main cities of Iberia soon became well known centers for music within the Islamic world.<ref name=Marin/> During the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to Iberia. While many were talented, Ziryab surpassed them all.<ref name=Menocal/>\n\nZiryab was most likely born in Baghdad{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, though Arab sources<ref>[[:ar:\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0628]]{{Better source|date=January 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> say he was born in Mosul and was trained in the art of music from a young age. During that time, Baghdad was an important center of music in the Muslim world. The sources all agree that the accomplished and talented musician Ishaq al-Mawsili was Ziryab's teacher. There is some debate about how he arrived in al-Andalus, but he may have offended his patron or some powerful figure with his musical talent.<ref name=Constable>{{Citation|title=Medieval Iberia|editor=Constable, Olivia Remie|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nOne account recorded by [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]] says that Ziryab inspired the jealousy of his mentor by giving an impressive performance for the caliph Harun al-Rashid (d. 809), with the result that al-Mawsili told him to leave the city.<ref name=Marin/><ref name=Menocal>{{Citation|title=The Literature of Al-Andalus|editor=Menocal, Mar\u00eda Rosa|editor2=Raymond P.

He then traveled first to ([[Syria]]), then to Ifriqiya ([[Tunisia]]), where he lived at the [[Aghlabid]] court of [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya|Ziyadat Allah]] (ruled 816\u2013837)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Language of the Heart|last=Epstein|first=Joel|publisher=KDP|year=2019|isbn=978-1070100906|location=https://www.amazon.com/Language-Heart-musical-fantastical-journey/dp/1070100900|pages=234 - 237}}</ref>. Ziryab fell out with Ziyadat Allah but was invited to [[Al-Andalus]] by the Umayyad prince, [[Al-Hakam I]] (ruled 796\u2013822). He found on arrival in 822 that the prince had died, but the prince's son, [[Abd ar-Rahman II]], renewed his father's invitation.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/> Ziryab settled in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] he was honored a monthly salary of 200 Gold [[Dinars]], he soon became even more celebrated as the court's aficionado of food, fashion, singing and music. He introduced standards of excellence in all these fields as well as setting new norms for elegant and noble manners. Ziryab became such a prominent cultural figure, and was given a huge salary from Abd al Rahman II.<ref name=Menocal/> He was an intimate companion of the prince and established a school of music that trained singers and musicians which influenced musical performance for at least two generations after him.\n\nAl-Maqqari states in his ''Nafh al-Tib'' (Fragrant Breeze): \"There never was, either before or after him (Ziryab), a man of his profession who was more generally beloved and admired\".\n\n===Music===\nZiryab is said to have improved the [[Oud]] (or [[La\u00fad]]) by adding a fifth pair of strings, and using an eagle's beak or quill instead of a wooden pick. Ziryab also dyed the four strings a color to symbolize the Aristotelian humors, and the fifth string to represent the soul.<ref name=Marin/> He is said to have created a unique and influential style of musical performance, and written songs that were performed in Iberia for generations. He was a great influence on Spanish music, and is considered the founder of the [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian music]] traditions of North Africa.\n\nZiryab's Baghdadi musical style became very popular in the court of Abd al-Rahman II.<ref name=Constable/> Ziryab also became the example of how a courtier, a person who attended aristocratic courts, should act. According to Ibn Hayyan, in common with erudite men of his time he was well versed in many areas of classical study such as astronomy, history, and geography.\n\nAccording to al-Tifashi, Ziryab appears to have popularized an early song-sequence, which may have been a precursor to the nawba (originally simply a performer's \"turn\" to perform for the prince), or [[Andalusi nubah|Nuba]], which is known today as the classical Arabic music of North Africa, though the connections are tenuous at best.\n\nAbd al-Rahman II was a great patron of the arts and Ziryab was given a great deal of freedom. He established one of the first schools of music in C\u00f3rdoba. This school incorporated both male and female students, who were very popular amongst the aristocracy of the time.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/> According to Ibn Hayyan, Ziryab developed various tests for them. If a student didn't have a large vocal capacity, for instance, he would put pieces of wood in their jaw to force them to hold their mouth open. Or he would tie a sash tightly around the waist to make them breathe in a particular way, and he would test incoming students by having them sing as loudly and as long a note as they possibly could to see whether they had lung capacity.\n\n===Family===\nAccording to the main source, Ibn Hayyan, Ziryab had eight sons and two daughters. Five of the sons and both daughters became musicians of some prominence.<ref name=Menocal/> These children kept their father's music school alive, but the female slave singers he trained also were regarded as reliable sources for his repertoire in the following generation.<ref name=\"Davila?\"/>\n\n===Fashion and hygiene===\nZiryab started a vogue by changing clothes according to the weather and season.<ref name=Menocal/> He suggested different clothing for mornings, afternoons and evenings. Henri Terrasse, a French historian of North Africa, commented that legend attributes winter and summer clothing styles and \"the luxurious dress of the Orient\" found in Morocco today to Ziryab, but argues that \"Without a doubt, a lone man could not achieve this transformation. It is rather a development which shook the Muslim world in general&nbsp;...\"<ref>Terrasse, H. (1958) 'Islam d'Espagne' une rencontre de l'Orient et de l'Occident\", Librairie Plon, Paris, pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nHe created a new type of deodorant to get rid of bad odors<ref name=Menocal/> and also promoted morning and evening baths and emphasized the maintenance of personal hygiene. Ziryab is thought to have invented an early [[toothpaste]], which he popularized throughout [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]]. The exact ingredients of this toothpaste are not currently known, but it was reported to have been both \"functional and pleasant to taste\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robert W. |first1=Lebling Jr. |title=Flight of the Blackbird |url=https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200304/flight.of.the.blackbird.htm |website=Saudi Aramco World}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Al-Maqqari before the arrival of Ziryab, all the people of al-Andalus, in the Cordoban court, wore their long hair parted in the middle and hung down loose down to the shoulders, men and women; Ziryab had his hair cut with bangs down to his eyebrows and straight across his forehead, \"new short hairstyles leaving the neck, ears and eyebrows free,\".<ref name=Marin>Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Manuela Marin (1994), ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'', p. 117, Brill Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-09599-3}}</ref> He popularized [[shaving]] among men and set new [[haircut]] trends.

However, this is not supported by the early sources.\n\n===Cuisine===\nHe was an arbiter of culinary fashion and taste, who also \"revolutionized the local cuisine\" by introducing new fruit and vegetables such as [[asparagus]], and by introducing the three-course meal served on leathern tablecloths, insisting that meals should be served in three separate courses consisting of [[soup]], the [[main course]], and dessert.<ref name=\"ZDF\">{{cite AV media |people=Susanne Utzt, Sahar Eslah, Martin Carazo Mendez, Christian Twente |date=30 October 2016 |title=Gro\u00dfe V\u00f6lker 2: Die Araber |trans-title=Great peoples 2: The Arabs |medium=Video documentary |language=German |url=https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/terra-x/grosse-voelker-die-araber-100.html |access-date=13 January 2017 |time=24:05 min |location=Germany |publisher=Terra X via [[ZDF]]}}</ref> He also introduced the use of [[crystal]] as a container for drinks, which was more effective than metal. This claim is supported by accounts of him cutting large crystal [[Chalice (cup)|goblets]].<ref name=Marin/> Prior to his time, food was served plainly on platters on bare tables, as was the case with the Romans.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Peacock|section|date=August 2019}}{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nZiryab revolutionized the court at C\u00f3rdoba and made it the stylistic capital of its time. Whether introducing new clothes, styles, foods, hygiene products, or music, Ziryab changed Andalusian culture forever. The musical contributions of Ziryab alone are staggering, laying the early groundwork for classic Spanish music. Ziryab transcended music and style and became a revolutionary cultural figure in 8th and 9th century Iberia.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Titus Burckhardt, \"Die Maurische Kultur in Spanien.\n*[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200407/flight.of.the.blackbird-.compilation..htm Flight of the Blackbird] Robert W.
