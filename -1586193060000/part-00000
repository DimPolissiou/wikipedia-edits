The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

From 1992 to 2017, Toms was a member of the [[PGA Tour]], where he won 13 events, including one [[Men's major golf championships|major]], the [[2001 PGA Championship]]. He was in the top 10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for 175 weeks between 2001 and 2006,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> and ranked as high as fifth in 2002 and 2003.\n\n==Early life and amateur career==\nToms was born in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]]<ref name=PGApro/> in northeastern [[Louisiana]]. He is the son of Thomas Edward \"Buster\" Toms of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in northwestern Louisiana. Toms won the 15-17 Boys' event at the 1984 [[Junior World Golf Championships]]. Toms also played little league baseball with future [[Major League Baseball]] players [[Albert Belle]] and [[Ben McDonald]].<ref name=villas/><ref name=media>{{cite web |title=PGA Tour Media Guide \u2013 David Toms |publisher=PGA Tour  |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02206.david-toms.html/media-guide/#uber |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> After graduating from Airline High School in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], he attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]],<ref name=PGApro>{{cite web |title=PGA Tour Profile \u2013 David Toms |publisher=PGA Tour |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02206.html |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> where he was a member of the golf team.<ref name=media/>\n\n==Professional career==\n===1989\u201398: Early years and first win===\nIn 1991, Toms finished T23 at the [[PGA Tour]] [[qualifying school]] to earn his first full tour card for the 1992 season. Toms made his first three cuts on tour including a third-place finish at the [[Northern Telecom Open]], although this was the only top 10 he would earn all season. The following season was also a struggle for Toms as he made just 12 of 32 cuts for the season, of which three were top-10 finishes. In 1994, Toms' lack of success continued on the PGA Tour and he lost his playing rights for the 1995 season.\n\nIn 1995, Toms played the entire season on the [[Nike Tour]] (now Web.com Tour) with greater success, winning two tournaments, the Greater Greenville Classic and the Wichita Open. This success earned Toms his PGA Tour card for the 1996 season.\n\nUpon his return to the PGA Tour in 1996, Toms had a disappointing season with just two top 10s. However, he did manage to qualify for his first major championship of his career at the 1996 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut.\n\nIn 1997, Toms won his first PGA Tour event at the [[Quad City Classic]], winning by three strokes over [[Brandel Chamblee]]. He followed this success in the 1998 season with a runner-up finish at the [[Tucson Chrysler Classic]]. At his first visit to [[Augusta National]], he recorded his best finish in a major championship at the time with a T-6 at the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]]. In his defense of the Quad City Classic title, Toms finished fourth.\n\n===1999\u20132000: Three more wins===\nIn 1999, Toms enjoyed seven top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour. In September, he won his second title at the [[The International (golf)|Sprint International]], by three strokes over [[David Duval]]. Toms almost added another title the following week when he narrowly missed out at the [[Reno-Tahoe Open]], finishing in T-2 behind [[Notah Begay III]]. Toms did, however, win his third PGA Tour title a month later at the [[Buick Challenge]], defeating [[Stuart Appleby]] by three strokes.\n\nIn 2000, Toms made 26 of 31 cuts, including a tie for fourth at [[The Open Championship]]. He won the [[Michelob Championship at Kingsmill]], defeating Canadian [[Mike Weir]] in a sudden-death playoff, giving Toms his fourth Tour victory.\n\n===2001: PGA Championship===\n{{Main|2001 PGA Championship}}\nThe standout year of Toms' career came in 2001. He had nine top-10 finishes and three wins on tour, one of which was his first [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]].<ref name=media/> Toms won the [[Compaq Classic of New Orleans]] by two strokes over [[Phil Mickelson]] for his fifth PGA Tour title. That summer, Toms won a major, the PGA Championship, by one stroke over Mickelson. His winning score of 265 in the [[2001 PGA Championship]] was the lowest absolute 72-hole score ever recorded in a major championship, until [[Henrik Stenson]] shot 264 in the [[2016 Open Championship]].<ref name=villas>{{cite web |title=David Toms bio |publisher=The Villas at Carter Plantation |url=http://thevillasatcarterplantation.com/david-toms.html |accessdate=August 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330182947/http://thevillasatcarterplantation.com/david-toms.html |archivedate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> Toms followed up his first major win by successfully defending his title at the Michelob Championship at Kingsmill.<ref name=mwjwtn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aGJPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AQQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4738%2C2463255 |work=Toledo Blade |location=(Ohio) |agency=Associated Press |title=Michelob win just what Toms needed |date=October 8, 2001 |page=C2}}</ref> At the last event of the year, Toms entered a four-man playoff at [[The Tour Championship]] where he, [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Ernie Els]] lost on the first extra hole to [[Mike Weir]].\n\n=== 2002\u201306: Five more wins ===\nIn 2002, Toms lost in a playoff at the season opening [[Mercedes Championship]] to Garc\u00eda when the Spaniard made birdie on the first extra hole. He did record a further 12 top-10 finishes with runner -up finishes at the [[MasterCard Colonial]] and the [[Buick Challenge]] followed by a sole third-place finish at The Tour Championship.\n\nToms finished runner-up at the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] in 2003 to [[Tiger Woods]], losing 2&1, and also finished tied for eighth at The Masters. At the [[Wachovia Championship]], he won his eighth PGA Tour title, by two strokes over [[Robert Gamez]], and then recorded his best showing ever at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], finishing T-5. A few weeks later, Toms won his ninth PGA Tour title at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] by three strokes over [[Nick Price]].\n\nIn 2004, he defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic by finishing six strokes clear of American [[Bob Estes]] for his 10th victory on the PGA Tour. Despite this win, Toms endured a steady yet unspectacular season earning over 2.3&nbsp;million dollars.\n\nToms enjoyed a much better start to the 2005 season in which he had top-10 finishes in five of his first seven events, including a win at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship to record his first [[World Golf Championship]] victory. He defeated fellow American [[Chris DiMarco]] 6&5 in the 36-hole final on Sunday for his 11th PGA Tour win. Along the way, Toms defeated notables including [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] and [[Ian Poulter]]. Later in the season, he almost defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic title for a third successive year but finished one stroke behind [[Justin Leonard]].\n\nEarly in 2006, Toms won his 12th PGA Tour title at the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]], finishing five strokes ahead of [[Chad Campbell]] and [[Rory Sabbatini]]. He followed up this early season form with a T-2 finish at the [[Ford Championship at Doral]] behind Tiger Woods and then a T-3 finish a week later at [[The Honda Classic]]. Toms' form dipped during the rest of season, only recording a further two top-10 finishes.\n\n===2007\u201312: Injuries and comeback===\nIn 2007, Toms had solid season with a succession of top-10 finishes, most notably a ninth-place finish at The Masters and an equal-best T-5 at the U.S. Open. Toms made just over $2&nbsp;million in prize money and finished 33rd in the [[FedEx Cup]] standings.\n\nToms struggled during the 2008 season with injuries that forced him to miss large parts of the season and underperform. He only participated in 20 events during the season with only one top 10. He finished the season 136th on the FedEx Cup standings, making just under $800,000.\n\nToms enjoyed a much better season in 2009, with three runner-up finishes at the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]], [[St. Jude Classic]] and the [[Travelers Championship]] amongst four other top-10 finishes. This form earned Toms a place in the season-ending [[The Tour Championship]]. He would finish 19th in the FedEx Cup standings with earnings over $3&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2010, Toms had just two top-10 finishes, his best placing coming at the [[Wyndham Championship]] where he finished in second place, one stroke behind winner [[Arjun Atwal]]. Toms made it to the third FedEx Cup playoff event the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] but did not make it into the top 30 to advance and eventually finished the season 55th in the standings.\n\nToms started the 2011 season well with a T-5 at the [[Mayakoba Golf Classic at Riviera Maya-Cancun]] and a T-3 at the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]]. Toms then came close to his first PGA Tour win in five years at [[2011 Players Championship|The Players Championship]] where he eventually lost on the first extra hole to South Korean [[K. J. Choi]]. This came despite leading the tournament for the majority of rounds two, three and four. Toms held the lead for the entire final round until he reached the par five 16th hole where he found the water with his second shot. This enabled Choi to take a one shot lead down the 18th hole; however Toms would make a birdie to Choi's par to take the event into a sudden-death playoff. At the first extra hole, the 17th, both players found the green with their tee shots. They would both go on to run their birdie attempts past the hole, but Toms would also see his par putt lip out from four feet, allowing Choi to make a three-foot putt for the victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/13407180.stm |title=Toms misses out in playoff to K. J. Choi |date=May 15, 2011 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nToms bounced back the week after his playoff loss to win the [[Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial]] by one shot over [[Charlie Wi]]. Toms tied the PGA Tour scoring record for 36 holes after shooting a pair of 8-under-par 62s for a seven shot lead at the halfway stage. Toms' lead disappeared after a third round 74 when he trailed Wi by one stroke entering the final round. However, in the final round he shot a 67, which included a holed-out eagle from the fairway on the 11th hole for a one stroke victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12176_6946145,00.html |title=Toms claims Colonial crown |date=June 6, 2011 |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> This was Toms' first win in over five years on the PGA Tour. The win guaranteed Toms a place in the U.S. Open and moved him up to 28th in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nIn June 2012, Toms recorded his best-ever performance in a U.S. Open when he finished T-4. Toms had been one of the co-leaders after 36 holes at one under par alongside fellow Americans Tiger Woods and [[Jim Furyk]], but his challenge fell apart on day three when he found himself five over for his first six holes on his way to a 76. Toms did perform well on Sunday with a two-under round of 68, but fell short by two strokes.\n\n==Other ventures==\n===Golf course design===\nToms owns a [[golf course design]] business, which he describes as what he plans to do after his playing days are over. His early works, all in Louisiana, were as a player-consultant, and in renovation and redesign of existing courses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Golf Course Design |publisher=davidtoms.com |url=http://www.davidtoms.com/design.cfm |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323102410/http://www.davidtoms.com/design.cfm |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}</ref> The first course for which he was the lead designer was Carter Plantation in [[Springfield, Louisiana]].<ref name=villas/><ref>{{cite web |title=David Toms |publisher=The Carter Plantation |url=http://www.carterplantation.com/golf/proto/carterplantation/david/david.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Philanthropy===\nIn 2003, Toms created the David Toms Foundation for the purpose of helping underprivileged, abused and abandoned children. Grants are made to programs that are designed to bolster a child's self-esteem, and help him or her develop into a productive citizen. His foundation raised more than $1.5&nbsp;million for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief.

Tour]]. From 1992 to 2017, Toms was a member of the [[PGA Tour]], where he won 13 events, including one [[Men's major golf championships|major]], the [[2001 PGA Championship]]. He was in the top 10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for 175 weeks between 2001 and 2006,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> and ranked as high as fifth in 2002 and 2003.\n\n==Early life and amateur career==\nToms was born in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]]<ref name=PGApro/> in northeastern [[Louisiana]]. He is the son of Thomas Edward \"Buster\" Toms of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in northwestern Louisiana. Toms won the 15-17 Boys' event at the 1984 [[Junior World Golf Championships]]. Toms also played little league baseball with future [[Major League Baseball]] players [[Albert Belle]] and [[Ben McDonald]].<ref name=villas/><ref name=media>{{cite web |title=PGA Tour Media Guide \u2013 David Toms |publisher=PGA Tour  |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02206.david-toms.html/media-guide/#uber |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> After graduating from Airline High School in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], he attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]],<ref name=PGApro>{{cite web |title=PGA Tour Profile \u2013 David Toms |publisher=PGA Tour |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02206.html |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> where he was a member of the golf team.<ref name=media/>\n\n==Professional career==\n===1989\u201398: Early years and first win===\nIn 1991, Toms finished T23 at the [[PGA Tour]] [[qualifying school]] to earn his first full tour card for the 1992 season. Toms made his first three cuts on tour including a third-place finish at the [[Northern Telecom Open]], although this was the only top 10 he would earn all season. The following season was also a struggle for Toms as he made just 12 of 32 cuts for the season, of which three were top-10 finishes. In 1994, Toms' lack of success continued on the PGA Tour and he lost his playing rights for the 1995 season.\n\nIn 1995, Toms played the entire season on the [[Nike Tour]] (now Web.com Tour) with greater success, winning two tournaments, the Greater Greenville Classic and the Wichita Open. This success earned Toms his PGA Tour card for the 1996 season.\n\nUpon his return to the PGA Tour in 1996, Toms had a disappointing season with just two top 10s. However, he did manage to qualify for his first major championship of his career at the 1996 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut.\n\nIn 1997, Toms won his first PGA Tour event at the [[Quad City Classic]], winning by three strokes over [[Brandel Chamblee]]. He followed this success in the 1998 season with a runner-up finish at the [[Tucson Chrysler Classic]]. At his first visit to [[Augusta National]], he recorded his best finish in a major championship at the time with a T-6 at the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]]. In his defense of the Quad City Classic title, Toms finished fourth.\n\n===1999\u20132000: Three more wins===\nIn 1999, Toms enjoyed seven top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour. In September, he won his second title at the [[The International (golf)|Sprint International]], by three strokes over [[David Duval]]. Toms almost added another title the following week when he narrowly missed out at the [[Reno-Tahoe Open]], finishing in T-2 behind [[Notah Begay III]]. Toms did, however, win his third PGA Tour title a month later at the [[Buick Challenge]], defeating [[Stuart Appleby]] by three strokes.\n\nIn 2000, Toms made 26 of 31 cuts, including a tie for fourth at [[The Open Championship]]. He won the [[Michelob Championship at Kingsmill]], defeating Canadian [[Mike Weir]] in a sudden-death playoff, giving Toms his fourth Tour victory.\n\n===2001: PGA Championship===\n{{Main|2001 PGA Championship}}\nThe standout year of Toms' career came in 2001. He had nine top-10 finishes and three wins on tour, one of which was his first [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]].<ref name=media/> Toms won the [[Compaq Classic of New Orleans]] by two strokes over [[Phil Mickelson]] for his fifth PGA Tour title. That summer, Toms won a major, the PGA Championship, by one stroke over Mickelson. His winning score of 265 in the [[2001 PGA Championship]] was the lowest absolute 72-hole score ever recorded in a major championship, until [[Henrik Stenson]] shot 264 in the [[2016 Open Championship]].<ref name=villas>{{cite web |title=David Toms bio |publisher=The Villas at Carter Plantation |url=http://thevillasatcarterplantation.com/david-toms.html |accessdate=August 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330182947/http://thevillasatcarterplantation.com/david-toms.html |archivedate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> Toms followed up his first major win by successfully defending his title at the Michelob Championship at Kingsmill.<ref name=mwjwtn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aGJPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AQQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4738%2C2463255 |work=Toledo Blade |location=(Ohio) |agency=Associated Press |title=Michelob win just what Toms needed |date=October 8, 2001 |page=C2}}</ref> At the last event of the year, Toms entered a four-man playoff at [[The Tour Championship]] where he, [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]] and [[Ernie Els]] lost on the first extra hole to [[Mike Weir]].\n\n=== 2002\u201306: Five more wins ===\nIn 2002, Toms lost in a playoff at the season opening [[Mercedes Championship]] to Garc\u00eda when the Spaniard made birdie on the first extra hole. He did record a further 12 top-10 finishes with runner -up finishes at the [[MasterCard Colonial]] and the [[Buick Challenge]] followed by a sole third-place finish at The Tour Championship.\n\nToms finished runner-up at the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] in 2003 to [[Tiger Woods]], losing 2&1, and also finished tied for eighth at The Masters. At the [[Wachovia Championship]], he won his eighth PGA Tour title, by two strokes over [[Robert Gamez]], and then recorded his best showing ever at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], finishing T-5. A few weeks later, Toms won his ninth PGA Tour title at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] by three strokes over [[Nick Price]].\n\nIn 2004, he defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic by finishing six strokes clear of American [[Bob Estes]] for his 10th victory on the PGA Tour. Despite this win, Toms endured a steady yet unspectacular season earning over 2.3&nbsp;million dollars.\n\nToms enjoyed a much better start to the 2005 season in which he had top-10 finishes in five of his first seven events, including a win at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship to record his first [[World Golf Championship]] victory. He defeated fellow American [[Chris DiMarco]] 6&5 in the 36-hole final on Sunday for his 11th PGA Tour win. Along the way, Toms defeated notables including [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] and [[Ian Poulter]]. Later in the season, he almost defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic title for a third successive year but finished one stroke behind [[Justin Leonard]].\n\nEarly in 2006, Toms won his 12th PGA Tour title at the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]], finishing five strokes ahead of [[Chad Campbell]] and [[Rory Sabbatini]]. He followed up this early season form with a T-2 finish at the [[Ford Championship at Doral]] behind Tiger Woods and then a T-3 finish a week later at [[The Honda Classic]]. Toms' form dipped during the rest of season, only recording a further two top-10 finishes.\n\n===2007\u201312: Injuries and comeback===\nIn 2007, Toms had solid season with a succession of top-10 finishes, most notably a ninth-place finish at The Masters and an equal-best T-5 at the U.S. Open. Toms made just over $2&nbsp;million in prize money and finished 33rd in the [[FedEx Cup]] standings.\n\nToms struggled during the 2008 season with injuries that forced him to miss large parts of the season and underperform. He only participated in 20 events during the season with only one top 10. He finished the season 136th on the FedEx Cup standings, making just under $800,000.\n\nToms enjoyed a much better season in 2009, with three runner-up finishes at the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]], [[St. Jude Classic]] and the [[Travelers Championship]] amongst four other top-10 finishes. This form earned Toms a place in the season-ending [[The Tour Championship]]. He would finish 19th in the FedEx Cup standings with earnings over $3&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2010, Toms had just two top-10 finishes, his best placing coming at the [[Wyndham Championship]] where he finished in second place, one stroke behind winner [[Arjun Atwal]]. Toms made it to the third FedEx Cup playoff event the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] but did not make it into the top 30 to advance and eventually finished the season 55th in the standings.\n\nToms started the 2011 season well with a T-5 at the [[Mayakoba Golf Classic at Riviera Maya-Cancun]] and a T-3 at the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]]. Toms then came close to his first PGA Tour win in five years at [[2011 Players Championship|The Players Championship]] where he eventually lost on the first extra hole to South Korean [[K. J. Choi]]. This came despite leading the tournament for the majority of rounds two, three and four. Toms held the lead for the entire final round until he reached the par five 16th hole where he found the water with his second shot. This enabled Choi to take a one shot lead down the 18th hole; however Toms would make a birdie to Choi's par to take the event into a sudden-death playoff. At the first extra hole, the 17th, both players found the green with their tee shots. They would both go on to run their birdie attempts past the hole, but Toms would also see his par putt lip out from four feet, allowing Choi to make a three-foot putt for the victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/13407180.stm |title=Toms misses out in playoff to K. J. Choi |date=May 15, 2011 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nToms bounced back the week after his playoff loss to win the [[Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial]] by one shot over [[Charlie Wi]]. Toms tied the PGA Tour scoring record for 36 holes after shooting a pair of 8-under-par 62s for a seven shot lead at the halfway stage. Toms' lead disappeared after a third round 74 when he trailed Wi by one stroke entering the final round. However, in the final round he shot a 67, which included a holed-out eagle from the fairway on the 11th hole for a one stroke victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12176_6946145,00.html |title=Toms claims Colonial crown |date=June 6, 2011 |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> This was Toms' first win in over five years on the PGA Tour. The win guaranteed Toms a place in the U.S. Open and moved him up to 28th in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nIn June 2012, Toms recorded his best-ever performance in a U.S. Open when he finished T-4. Toms had been one of the co-leaders after 36 holes at one under par alongside fellow Americans Tiger Woods and [[Jim Furyk]], but his challenge fell apart on day three when he found himself five over for his first six holes on his way to a 76. Toms did perform well on Sunday with a two-under round of 68, but fell short by two strokes.\n\n==Other ventures==\n===Golf course design===\nToms owns a [[golf course design]] business, which he describes as what he plans to do after his playing days are over. His early works, all in Louisiana, were as a player-consultant, and in renovation and redesign of existing courses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Golf Course Design |publisher=davidtoms.com |url=http://www.davidtoms.com/design.cfm |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323102410/http://www.davidtoms.com/design.cfm |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}</ref> The first course for which he was the lead designer was Carter Plantation in [[Springfield, Louisiana]].<ref name=villas/><ref>{{cite web |title=David Toms |publisher=The Carter Plantation |url=http://www.carterplantation.com/golf/proto/carterplantation/david/david.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Philanthropy===\nIn 2003, Toms created the David Toms Foundation for the purpose of helping underprivileged, abused and abandoned children. Grants are made to programs that are designed to bolster a child's self-esteem, and help him or her develop into a productive citizen. His foundation raised more than $1.5&nbsp;million for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief. For his efforts, Toms shared the 2006 Golf Writers Association of America's ''Charlie Bennett Award'' with fellow Louisianans [[Kelly Gibson]] and [[Hal Sutton]].<ref name=media/>\n\n==Personal life==\nToms currently resides in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] in northwestern Louisiana. He and wife, Sonya, have two children, Carter and Anna.  In 2015, his son Carter signed to play for Louisiana State University.\n\n==Professional wins (18)==\n===PGA Tour wins (13)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" \n|'''Legend''' \n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|Major championships (1) \n|-style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\" \n|World Golf Championships (1) \n|-\n|Other PGA Tour (11) \n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!To par\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|Jul 13, [[1997 PGA Tour|1997]]\n|[[Quad City Classic]]\n|67-66-67-65=265\n|align=center|\u221215\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Brandel Chamblee]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Robert Gamez]],<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jimmy Johnston (golfer, born 1969)|Jimmy Johnston]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|Aug 22, [[1999 PGA Tour|1999]]\n|[[The International (golf)|Sprint International]]\n|align=center colspan=2|47 pts (16-13-10-8=47)\n|3 points\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[David Duval]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|Oct 3, 1999\n|[[Buick Challenge]]\n|68-66-66-71=271\n|align=center|\u221217\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Stuart Appleby]]\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|Oct 8, [[2000 PGA Tour|2000]]\n|[[Michelob Championship at Kingsmill]]\n|68-70-67-66=271\n|align=center|\u221213\n|Playoff\n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Mike Weir]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|May 6, [[2001 PGA Tour|2001]]\n|[[Compaq Classic of New Orleans]]\n|66-73-63-64=266\n|align=center|\u221222\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]]\n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|6\n|align=right|Aug 19, 2001\n|'''[[2001 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]]'''\n|66-65-65-69=265\n|align=center|\u221215\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Phil Mickelson]]\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|align=right|Oct 7, 2001\n|[[Michelob Championship at Kingsmill]] <small>(2)</small>\n|64-70-67-68=269\n|align=center|\u221215\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Kirk Triplett]] \n|-\n|align=center|8\n|align=right|May 11, [[2003 PGA Tour|2003]]\n|[[Wachovia Championship]]\n|70-69-66-73=278\n|align=center|\u221210\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Robert Gamez]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Brent Geiberger]],<br>{{flagicon|FJI}} [[Vijay Singh]]\n|-\n|align=center|9\n|align=right|Jun 29, 2003\n|[[FedEx St. Jude Classic]]\n|68-67-65-64=264\n|align=center|\u221220\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|ZWE}} [[Nick Price]]\n|-\n|align=center|10\n|align=right|May 30, [[2004 PGA Tour|2004]]\n|[[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] <small>(2)</small>\n|67-63-65-73=268\n|align=center|\u221216\n|6 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bob Estes]]\n|-style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\" \n|align=center|11\n|align=right|Feb 27, [[2005 PGA Tour|2005]]\n|[[2005 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship|WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]]\n|colspan=3 align=center|6 & 5\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chris DiMarco]]\n|-\n|align=center|12\n|align=right|Jan 15, [[2006 PGA Tour|2006]]\n|[[Sony Open in Hawaii]]\n|66-69-61-65=261\n|align=center|\u221219\n|5 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chad Campbell]], {{flagicon|ZAF}} [[Rory Sabbatini]]\n|-\n|align=center|13\n|May 22, [[2011 PGA Tour|2011]]\n|[[Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial]]\n|62-62-74-67=265\n|align=center|\u221215\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Charlie Wi]]\n|}\n\n'''PGA Tour playoff record (1\u20133)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent(s)!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"\n|align=center|1\n|2000\n|[[Michelob Championship at Kingsmill]]\n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Mike Weir]]\n|Won with par on first extra hole\n|-style=\"background:#F08080;\"\n|align=center|2\n|2001\n|[[The Tour Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|RSA}} [[Ernie Els]], {{flagicon|ESP}} [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]],<br>{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Mike Weir]]\n|Weir won with birdie on first extra hole\n|-style=\"background:#F08080;\"\n|align=center|3\n|2002\n|[[Mercedes Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]]\n|Lost to birdie on first extra hole\n|-style=\"background:#F08080;\"\n|align=center|4\n|2011\n|[[2011 Players Championship|The Players Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[K.

He spent 167 weeks in the top-10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] from its introduction, in 1986, until 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> Lyle was inducted to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in May 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7355035/world-golf-hall-fame-sandy-lyle-peter-alliss-join-class-2012 |title=Sandy Lyle, Peter Alliss picked for Hall |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLyle was born in [[Shrewsbury]], England and now lives in Scotland with his wife Jolande and children Lonneke and Quintin. He represented [[Scotland]] during his professional career. He was introduced to golf by his father, Alex, who had taken the family from Scotland to England in 1955 when he became resident professional at [[Hawkstone Park]] golf course. Their family home was just 40 yards from the pro-shop and 18th green. He began playing with miniature clubs at the age of 3. At schoolboy, junior and amateur level Lyle represented England. As an amateur Lyle made his debut in [[The Open Championship]] at age 16 in 1974, and won the [[Brabazon Trophy]] in 1975 and 1977. He was a member of the [[Walker Cup]] team in 1977.\n\n==Turns professional==\nIn 1977 he turned professional and decided to represent Scotland. He was medalist at the 1977 Qualifying School tournament for the [[European Tour]]. His first professional win came in the 1978 Nigerian Open, and he also won the Sir [[Henry Cotton (golfer)|Henry Cotton]] Award as European Rookie of the Year that season. Lyle attained the first of an eventual 18 European Tour titles in 1979.\n\nLyle partnered with [[Sam Torrance]] for Scotland to finish runner-up at the [[World Cup of Golf]] team event in both 1979 and 1980; in the latter year Lyle captured the low individual trophy in that event.\n\n==Wins major championships, Ryder Cup success==\nLyle showed his quality by winning [[The Open Championship]] at [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] in 1985. He was the first British winner since [[Tony Jacklin]] in 1969, and continued the rise of European golfers in the world scene.\n\nLyle was a member of five European [[Ryder Cup]] teams, from 1979 to 1987 inclusive. Highlights from those years included the team that was victorious at the [[The De Vere Belfry|Belfry]] in the autumn of 1985, and the 1987 team which won for the first time ever on American soil, at [[Muirfield Village]].\n\nFor many golf fans he is best known for the [[bunker shot]] at the 18th hole in the final round of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] in 1988 when he became the first Briton to wear the green jacket.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/sandy-lyle-i-dont-know-whether-theres-ever-been-a-better-shot-in-a-major-801647.html |title=Sandy Lyle: 'I don't know whether there's ever been a better shot in a major' |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |first=Brian |last=Viner |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> He also won two other events on the PGA Tour that season, along with the [[HSBC World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]], after being a losing finalist on several occasions.\n\nLyle topped the [[European Tour]]'s [[European Tour Order of Merit|order of merit]] in 1979, 1980 and 1985. He finished in the top ten nine times between 1979 and 1992. He was also a member of the [[PGA Tour]] for several years and finished seventh on the US money list in 1988, despite a limited playing schedule. He won the 1987 [[Tournament Players Championship]], one of the most prestigious American titles. Lyle's form dropped after 1992, when he was 34, and he has not won a significant event since.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs a player, Lyle is known for his cool temperament and placid exterior. In his peak years, he was very long from the tee and through the set, and had enough accuracy to master any course. His achievements inspired fellow rivals such as [[Nick Faldo]] and [[Ian Woosnam]] to raise their games, and go on to win the [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]. Lyle published his first book, \"To the Fairway Born\" in 2006. In the same year he was assistant captain to [[Ian Woosnam]] when Europe won the [[Ryder Cup]]. He had been hoping to be picked as the captain for the 2010 European Ryder Cup team but missed out to [[Colin Montgomerie]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/7857780.stm |title=Lyle downcast over Cup decision |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, Lyle got into a very public row with Colin Montgomerie where he unfavourably compared Montgomerie's actions at the [[Indonesia Open (golf)|Indonesian Open]] four years previously with his own actions in not completing a round at the [[2008 Open Championship]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Donegan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/14/sandy-lyle-colin-montgomerie-cheating |title=Sandy Lyle accuses Colin Montgomerie of a 'form of cheating' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=12 July 2009}}</ref> Reaction to this was mixed with some players supporting Lyle while other players and commentators felt that Lyle's timing was unfortunate and that any point he may have had was lost in the ensuing controversy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/lyles+montgomerie+outburst+condemned/3265727 |title=Lyle's Montgomerie outburst condemned |publisher=Channel 4 |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718042933/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/lyles+montgomerie+outburst+condemned/3265727 |archivedate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Senior career==\nOn turning 50 in 2008, Lyle played on the [[Champions Tour]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.01717.sandy-lyle.html |title=PGA Tour profile |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> and the [[European Senior Tour]].\n\nLyle won his first tournament in 19 years when he captured his first European Senior Tour title at the 2011 ISPS Handa Senior World Championship, held in China.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://progolftalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/13/sandy-lyle-wins-for-first-time-in-nearly-two-decades/ |title=Sandy Lyle wins for first time in nearly two decades |work=[[NBC Sports]] |first=Ryan |last=Ballengee |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417180353/http://progolftalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/13/sandy-lyle-wins-for-first-time-in-nearly-two-decades |archivedate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe took up [[hickory golf]], winning the World Hickory Open in his native Scotland in 2014 and 2016.

{{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 9 February 1958) is a Scottish [[professional golfer]]. Lyle has won two major championships during his career. Along with [[Nick Faldo]] and [[Ian Woosnam]], he became one of Britain's top golfers during the 1980s. He spent 167 weeks in the top-10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] from its introduction, in 1986, until 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> Lyle was inducted to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in May 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7355035/world-golf-hall-fame-sandy-lyle-peter-alliss-join-class-2012 |title=Sandy Lyle, Peter Alliss picked for Hall |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLyle was born in [[Shrewsbury]], England and now lives in Scotland with his wife Jolande and children Lonneke and Quintin. He represented [[Scotland]] during his professional career. He was introduced to golf by his father, Alex, who had taken the family from Scotland to England in 1955 when he became resident professional at [[Hawkstone Park]] golf course. Their family home was just 40 yards from the pro-shop and 18th green. He began playing with miniature clubs at the age of 3. At schoolboy, junior and amateur level Lyle represented England. As an amateur Lyle made his debut in [[The Open Championship]] at age 16 in 1974, and won the [[Brabazon Trophy]] in 1975 and 1977. He was a member of the [[Walker Cup]] team in 1977.\n\n==Turns professional==\nIn 1977 he turned professional and decided to represent Scotland. He was medalist at the 1977 Qualifying School tournament for the [[European Tour]]. His first professional win came in the 1978 Nigerian Open, and he also won the Sir [[Henry Cotton (golfer)|Henry Cotton]] Award as European Rookie of the Year that season. Lyle attained the first of an eventual 18 European Tour titles in 1979.\n\nLyle partnered with [[Sam Torrance]] for Scotland to finish runner-up at the [[World Cup of Golf]] team event in both 1979 and 1980; in the latter year Lyle captured the low individual trophy in that event.\n\n==Wins major championships, Ryder Cup success==\nLyle showed his quality by winning [[The Open Championship]] at [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] in 1985. He was the first British winner since [[Tony Jacklin]] in 1969, and continued the rise of European golfers in the world scene.\n\nLyle was a member of five European [[Ryder Cup]] teams, from 1979 to 1987 inclusive. Highlights from those years included the team that was victorious at the [[The De Vere Belfry|Belfry]] in the autumn of 1985, and the 1987 team which won for the first time ever on American soil, at [[Muirfield Village]].\n\nFor many golf fans he is best known for the [[bunker shot]] at the 18th hole in the final round of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] in 1988 when he became the first Briton to wear the green jacket.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/sandy-lyle-i-dont-know-whether-theres-ever-been-a-better-shot-in-a-major-801647.html |title=Sandy Lyle: 'I don't know whether there's ever been a better shot in a major' |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |first=Brian |last=Viner |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> He also won two other events on the PGA Tour that season, along with the [[HSBC World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]], after being a losing finalist on several occasions.\n\nLyle topped the [[European Tour]]'s [[European Tour Order of Merit|order of merit]] in 1979, 1980 and 1985. He finished in the top ten nine times between 1979 and 1992. He was also a member of the [[PGA Tour]] for several years and finished seventh on the US money list in 1988, despite a limited playing schedule. He won the 1987 [[Tournament Players Championship]], one of the most prestigious American titles. Lyle's form dropped after 1992, when he was 34, and he has not won a significant event since.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs a player, Lyle is known for his cool temperament and placid exterior. In his peak years, he was very long from the tee and through the set, and had enough accuracy to master any course. His achievements inspired fellow rivals such as [[Nick Faldo]] and [[Ian Woosnam]] to raise their games, and go on to win the [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]. Lyle published his first book, \"To the Fairway Born\" in 2006. In the same year he was assistant captain to [[Ian Woosnam]] when Europe won the [[Ryder Cup]]. He had been hoping to be picked as the captain for the 2010 European Ryder Cup team but missed out to [[Colin Montgomerie]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/7857780.stm |title=Lyle downcast over Cup decision |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, Lyle got into a very public row with Colin Montgomerie where he unfavourably compared Montgomerie's actions at the [[Indonesia Open (golf)|Indonesian Open]] four years previously with his own actions in not completing a round at the [[2008 Open Championship]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Donegan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/14/sandy-lyle-colin-montgomerie-cheating |title=Sandy Lyle accuses Colin Montgomerie of a 'form of cheating' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=28 May 2011 |date=12 July 2009}}</ref> Reaction to this was mixed with some players supporting Lyle while other players and commentators felt that Lyle's timing was unfortunate and that any point he may have had was lost in the ensuing controversy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/lyles+montgomerie+outburst+condemned/3265727 |title=Lyle's Montgomerie outburst condemned |publisher=Channel 4 |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718042933/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/lyles+montgomerie+outburst+condemned/3265727 |archivedate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Senior career==\nOn turning 50 in 2008, Lyle played on the [[Champions Tour]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.01717.sandy-lyle.html |title=PGA Tour profile |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> and the [[European Senior Tour]].\n\nLyle won his first tournament in 19 years when he captured his first European Senior Tour title at the 2011 ISPS Handa Senior World Championship, held in China.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://progolftalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/13/sandy-lyle-wins-for-first-time-in-nearly-two-decades/ |title=Sandy Lyle wins for first time in nearly two decades |work=[[NBC Sports]] |first=Ryan |last=Ballengee |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417180353/http://progolftalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/13/sandy-lyle-wins-for-first-time-in-nearly-two-decades |archivedate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe took up [[hickory golf]], winning the World Hickory Open in his native Scotland in 2014 and 2016.

{"title_page": "Deep Throat (Watergate)", "text_new": "{{short description|Alias of Mark Felt, the whistleblower who exposed the Watergate scandal}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:MarkFelt.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Felt]] a.k.a. \"Deep Throat\"]]\n\n'''Deep Throat''' is the [[pseudonym]] given to the secret informant who provided information in 1972 to [[Bob Woodward]], who shared it with [[Carl Bernstein]]. Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney's claim.\n\n==Background==\nDeep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''The Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]]. The [[All the President's Men (film)|film based on the book]] was released two years later; having been nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], it won two.\n\n[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat,\" alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.<ref>[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html \"Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.</ref>\n\nOn May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.<ref>Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon & Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}</ref> [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's overseer, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.\n\n==Role in the Watergate scandal==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\n{{Watergate|Intelligence}}\n\nOn June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|2300|1972|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), plastic gloves to hide fingerprints, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie and radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras with 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, multiple electronic devices which they intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], popularly known as \"CREEP\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-mccord-jr-watergate-conspirator-who-linked-break-in-to-the-white-house-dies-at-93/2019/04/18/11c2082e-6195-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html</ref>; a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]].\n\n''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of Nixon's White House, culminating in Nixon becoming the only United States president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed \"Deep Throat\".\n\n===Methods of communication===\nWoodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions \"Deep Throat\" on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling \"''an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office''\". Later, he describes him as \"''a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House''\". The book also calls him \"''an incurable gossip''\" and states \"''in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch''\", and as a man \"''whose fight had been worn out in too many battles''\".\n\nWoodward claimed that he would signal to \"Deep Throat\" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When \"Deep Throat\" wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met \"on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]\", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as \"Deep Throat\" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, \"I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.\"<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10328832\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFurther, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called \"Deep Throat\" on the telephone at his home. Felt's wife recalls answering Woodward's telephone calls for Felt.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2005/07/deepthroat200507</ref>\n\n===Controversy over motives===\nIn public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.\n\nIn his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist to and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] had no law ''enforcement'' experience and was appointed as Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.\n\nSome conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office,<ref name=\"traitor\">Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101420.html \"Contemporaries Have Mixed Views\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 2005.</ref> often claiming it a \"Witch Hunt\"<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14811140/1973-07-22-witch-hunt/</ref>\n\n== Speculation concerning W. Mark Felt ==\n{{Copy edit|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}\n=== Speculation within the White House ===\nAlthough confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005. In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked information to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters did not reveal their source, ''Time'' correspondent Sandy Smith told ''Time''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Roswell Gilpatric]], a partner of [[Cravath, Swaine & Moore]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}</ref> Gilpatric then passed the information to [[Henry E. Peterson]], the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in the Department of Criminal Justice. In turn, Peterson revealed the information to White House Counsel [[John W. Dean]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}</ref> who finally reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}</ref>\n\nNixon did not publicly acknowledge anything about learning Deep Throat's identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions. In the [[Nixon White House tapes#The \"smoking_gun\" tape|\"smoking gun\" tape]], Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, stated that Felt \"knows everything there is to know in the FBI.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neikirk |first1=William |last2=Dorning |first2=Mike |title=President Called Felt a 'Traitor' in '73 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-06-02-0506020166-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 June 2005}}</ref> Haldeman implied that Nixon's motives for not outing Felt were not entirely altruistic, especially because Nixon may have been damaged by Felt's revelations.\n\n=== Speculation in the press and the public ===\nAmong other evidence, it had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other public hints, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: \"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\"<ref>[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.</ref> However, Woodward and Bernstein were famously tight-lipped concerning their informant's identity. Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, \"I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was, \"100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI.\"<ref name=\"Courant\">{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=David |title=Deep Throat |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-07-28-9907280810-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=The Hartford Courant |date=28 July 1999}}</ref> Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her \"speculations\"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward had done for many others.<ref name=\"Courant\"/> James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref>Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann \"Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis\"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.</ref> Mann recalled that before  the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWoodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal himself as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt \"the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat\".<ref>Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/05/why_did_bob_woodward_lunch_with_mark_felt_in_1999.html \"Why Did Bob Woodward Lunch With Mark Felt in 1999?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', May 2, 2002.</ref> In 1976, Assistant Attorney General [[John Stanley Pottinger]] had convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins that Felt had authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, \"Are you Deep Throat?\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger reports that Felt, \"went white with fear\".{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully, but since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.\n\nIn his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', [[Ronald Kessler]] wrote that Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home where Felt was staying with his daughter Joan and took Felt to lunch.<ref name=\"Kessler\">{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}</ref> Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\"<ref name=\"Kessler\"/> Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \"credence\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. \"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, the page reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that \"Deep Throat\" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].\n\n=== Felt's confirmation of his identity ===\nOn May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as \"Deep Throat\".<ref>{{cite news|first=John D.|last= O'Connor|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&currentPage=all|title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat|date=May 31, 2005|accessdate =November 28, 2008|publisher= VanityFair.com}}</ref> Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate.<ref>{{cite news|first= Bob|last= Woodward|authorlink=Bob Woodward|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html|title=How Mark Felt Became 'Deep Throat'|date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate =November 28, 2008|work= [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.\n\nAfter deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.\n\nCommenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, \"Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.\n\n==Composite character theory==\nPrior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/>\n\nEd Gray, the son of [[L.

In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003</ref> Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.\n\nDean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.\n\nOne reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that \"Deep Throat\" worked in the intelligence community:\n\n: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate\u2014among them the fabled Deep Throat\u2014may have been people in the intelligence community?\n\n: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.<ref>Noah, Timothy.

Mitchell]]. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to \"Deep Throat\". In February 2005, Dean reported that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was \"Deep Throat\". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.\n* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with \"Deep Throat\".\n* [[George H.

Havill had argued in his biography that \"Deep Throat\" was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to ''[[Poynter Online]]'' that based on more recent events and research, he now believed \"Deep Throat\" was George H. W. Bush.\n* General [[Alexander Haig]]: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' that Haig may have been \"Deep Throat\". Died in 2010.\n* [[Diane Sawyer]]: Was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Richard Nixon Administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter [[Baruch Korff]] wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.\n* [[Ben Stein]]: A Nixon speechwriter and the son of Nixon economic advisor [[Herbert Stein]]; later an [[actor]], political commentator, and [[game show host]].\n* [[Gerald R. Ford]]: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency.\n* [[Pat Buchanan]]: Served as special assistant to the President, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his June 2002 book ''Unmasking Deep Throat''. Buchanan repeatedly denied the claim, stating in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article on the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in that \"The last time I cooperated with ''The Washington Post''...was in 1952, when I was a paperboy delivering the damn thing in Northwest Washington.\" Buchanan was very interested in the mystery, however, and had a number of theories. He was most sympathetic to the idea of a composite Deep Throat.\n* [[Richard Nixon]] himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media which backfired horrifically.

Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney's claim.\n\n==Background==\nDeep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''The Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]]. The [[All the President's Men (film)|film based on the book]] was released two years later; having been nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], it won two.\n\n[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat,\" alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.<ref>[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html \"Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.</ref>\n\nOn May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.<ref>Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon & Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}</ref> [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's overseer, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.\n\n==Role in the Watergate scandal==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\n{{Watergate|Intelligence}}\n\nOn June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|2300|1972|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), plastic gloves to hide fingerprints, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie and radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras with 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, multiple electronic devices which they intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], popularly known as \"CREEP\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-mccord-jr-watergate-conspirator-who-linked-break-in-to-the-white-house-dies-at-93/2019/04/18/11c2082e-6195-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html</ref>; a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]].\n\n''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of Nixon's White House, culminating in Nixon becoming the only United States president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed \"Deep Throat\".\n\n===Methods of communication===\nWoodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions \"Deep Throat\" on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling \"''an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office''\". Later, he describes him as \"''a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House''\". The book also calls him \"''an incurable gossip''\" and states \"''in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch''\", and as a man \"''whose fight had been worn out in too many battles''\".\n\nWoodward claimed that he would signal to \"Deep Throat\" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When \"Deep Throat\" wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met \"on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]\", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as \"Deep Throat\" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, \"I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.\"<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10328832\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFurther, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called \"Deep Throat\" on the telephone at his home. Felt's wife recalls answering Woodward's telephone calls for Felt.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2005/07/deepthroat200507</ref>\n\n===Controversy over motives===\nIn public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.\n\nIn his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist to and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] had no law ''enforcement'' experience and was appointed as Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.\n\nSome conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office,<ref name=\"traitor\">Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005).

In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked information to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters did not reveal their source, ''Time'' correspondent Sandy Smith told ''Time''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Roswell Gilpatric]], a partner of [[Cravath, Swaine & Moore]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}</ref> Gilpatric then passed the information to [[Henry E. Peterson]], the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in the Department of Criminal Justice. In turn, Peterson revealed the information to White House Counsel [[John W. Dean]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}</ref> who finally reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}</ref>\n\nNixon did not publicly acknowledge anything about learning Deep Throat's identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions. In the [[Nixon White House tapes#The \"smoking_gun\" tape|\"smoking gun\" tape]], Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, stated that Felt \"knows everything there is to know in the FBI.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neikirk |first1=William |last2=Dorning |first2=Mike |title=President Called Felt a 'Traitor' in '73 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-06-02-0506020166-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 June 2005}}</ref> Haldeman implied that Nixon's motives for not outing Felt were not entirely altruistic, especially because Nixon may have been damaged by Felt's revelations.\n\n=== Speculation in the press and the public ===\nAmong other evidence, it had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other public hints, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: \"Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie.\"<ref>[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.</ref> However, Woodward and Bernstein were famously tight-lipped concerning their informant's identity. Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, \"I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was \"100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI.\"<ref name=\"Courant\">{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=David |title=Deep Throat |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-07-28-9907280810-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=The Hartford Courant |date=28 July 1999}}</ref> Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her \"speculations\"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward had done for many others.<ref name=\"Courant\"/> James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref>Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann \"Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis\"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.</ref> Mann recalled that before  the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWoodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal him as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt \"the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat\".<ref>Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/05/why_did_bob_woodward_lunch_with_mark_felt_in_1999.html \"Why Did Bob Woodward Lunch With Mark Felt in 1999?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', May 2, 2002.</ref> In 1976, Assistant Attorney General [[John Stanley Pottinger]] had convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins that Felt had authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, \"Are you Deep Throat?\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger reports that Felt \"went white with fear\".{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully, but since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.\n\nIn his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', [[Ronald Kessler]] wrote that Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home where Felt was staying with his daughter Joan and took Felt to lunch.<ref name=\"Kessler\">{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}</ref> Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. \"Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. \"He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine.\"<ref name=\"Kessler\"/> Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent \"credence\" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. \"There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, the page reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that \"Deep Throat\" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].\n\n=== Felt's confirmation of his identity ===\nOn May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as \"Deep Throat\".<ref>{{cite news|first=John D.|last= O'Connor|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&currentPage=all|title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat|date=May 31, 2005|accessdate =November 28, 2008|publisher= VanityFair.com}}</ref> Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate.<ref>{{cite news|first= Bob|last= Woodward|authorlink=Bob Woodward|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html|title=How Mark Felt Became 'Deep Throat'|date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate =November 28, 2008|work= [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.\n\nAfter deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.\n\nCommenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, \"Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.\"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.\n\n==Composite character theory==\nPrior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.<ref name=\" Greenberg\"/> It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/>\n\nEd Gray, the son of [[L. Patrick Gray III]], stated in ''In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate'' that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provided \"convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication\".<ref name=\" Gray & Gray\">{{cite book |last1=Gray III |first1=L.

Fielding]]. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003</ref> Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.\n\nDean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.\n\nOne reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that \"Deep Throat\" worked in the intelligence community:\n\n: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate\u2014among them the fabled Deep Throat\u2014may have been people in the intelligence community?\n\n: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.<ref>Noah, Timothy.

Mitchell]]. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to \"Deep Throat\". In February 2005, Dean reported that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was \"Deep Throat\". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.\n* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with \"Deep Throat\".\n* [[George H. W. Bush]]: Was nominated in February 2005 by [[Adrian Havill]]\u2013author of a 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, ''Deep Truth'' ({{ISBN|1-55972-172-3}})-following the unveiling of Woodward's notes at the [[the University of Texas System|University of Texas]]. Havill had argued in his biography that \"Deep Throat\" was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to ''[[Poynter Online]]'' that based on more recent events and research, he now believed \"Deep Throat\" was George H. W. Bush.\n* General [[Alexander Haig]]: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' that Haig may have been \"Deep Throat\". Died in 2010.\n* [[Diane Sawyer]]: Was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Richard Nixon Administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter [[Baruch Korff]] wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.\n* [[Ben Stein]]: A Nixon speechwriter and the son of Nixon economic advisor [[Herbert Stein]]; later an [[actor]], political commentator, and [[game show host]].\n* [[Gerald R. Ford]]: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency.\n* [[Pat Buchanan]]: Served as special assistant to the President, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his June 2002 book ''Unmasking Deep Throat''. Buchanan repeatedly denied the claim, stating in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article on the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in that \"The last time I cooperated with ''The Washington Post''...was in 1952, when I was a paperboy delivering the damn thing in Northwest Washington.\" Buchanan was very interested in the mystery, however, and had a number of theories. He was most sympathetic to the idea of a composite Deep Throat.\n* [[Richard Nixon]] himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media which backfired horrifically. This theory was largely discredited.\n* [[J. Fred Buzhardt]]: White House counsel to President Nixon.\n* [[G. Gordon Liddy]]: Member of the [[White House Plumbers]]. Largely dismissed.\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n===Audio dramas===\n* 3Sol used the name Deep Throat to lure Tyler Steele to his attempted assassination in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]'s ''[[Torchwood (audio drama series)#Aliens Among Us (2017\u201318)|Torchwood: Aliens Among Us 1]]''.\n\n===Films===\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] portrayed Deep Throat in the film adaptation of ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), in which he uttered the catchphrase, \"[[Follow the money]]\".\n* In the comedy film ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' (1999), Deep Throat is revealed as being two teenage Washingtonian girls, portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], who worked as Nixon's dog walkers.\n* In the Nickelodeon animated film ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'' (2002), Helga Pataki takes on a similar role under the guise of Deep Voice. She is a shadowy character who aids Arnold and Gerald in trying to save the neighborhood from the evil developer Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck through a series of anonymous phone calls and cryptic advice. At the end of the film, her identity is revealed, and she finally confesses her love to Arnold and successfully saves the neighborhood.\n* In the [[Spy film|spy]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'' (2017), [[Liam Neeson]] portrays Mark Felt.\n\n===Games===\n*In the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998), the cyborg ninja informant [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Gray Fox]] goes by the name Deepthroat until revealing his identity to protagonist [[Solid Snake]].\n**Similarly, in the sequel, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' (2001), the name is briefly assumed by [[List of Metal Gear characters#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]], until the protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] realizes her connection to Gray Fox of the previous game, at which point she uses the less explicit name \"Mr. X\", instead.\n\n===Literature===\n* In Terry Pratchett's   [[Discworld]] novel ''The Truth'' (2000), in a reference to or parody of Deep Throat, the talking dog Gaspode takes on the role of Deep Bone, acting as an informant to the novel's protagonist William de Worde regarding the attempted framing of Patrician Vetinari.\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[Fairly OddParents]]'' episode \"[[Channel Chasers]]\", Tootie uses the \"Deep Toot\" undercover persona to help out Mr. and Mrs. Turner against Vicky.\n*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Deep Throats]]\", [[Kermit the Frog]] plays a similar role to provide evidence of [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]]'s corruption to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]].\n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]\", [[Waylon Smithers]] played a similar role to Deep Throat's when covertly helping the Simpson children find a way to depose the newly elected mayor of Springfield, Sideshow Bob (he even paraphrased one of Deep Throat's statements).\n*''[[The X-Files]]'' featured an informant who was identified by the name \"[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]\".  This \"Deep Throat\" leaked secret government information to the series character [[Agent Mulder]] in a manner similar to the meetings described by Woodward. The character never identified himself as \"Deep Throat\"\u2014the name was used by other characters when referring to him.  It was never specifically mentioned whether he was initially intended to be the same Deep Throat from Watergate; eventually, the character was revealed to be a government official named Ronald Pakula.\n* In season 1 of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Perry White has a government contact called Sore Throat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0635154/|title=Honeymoon in Metropolis|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n*In ''[[Frasier]]'', season 4 episode 11 \"[[Three Days of the Condo]]\", [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] meets a secretive informant in an underground parking garage who supplies him with information.\n*In the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Drippy Pony\", there is a sketch where a shadowed man approaches a man in a parking garage.

The following year he was one of [[Hal Sutton]]'s two captain's picks for the [[Ryder Cup]], and made his third appearance in that event.\n\nHaas was known for being one of the most consistent players on the PGA Tour over the course of his career and ended up playing 798 events.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.01457.jay-haas.html |title=Jay Haas \u2013 Profile |publisher=PGA Tour |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> He is only five starts off [[Mark Brooks (golfer)|Mark Brooks]]' record.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/davis-love-iii-takes-another-162300118.html |title=Davis Love III takes another step toward a PGA Tour record he isn't sure he can break anymore |work=Yahoo Sports |first=Alex |last=Myers |date=November 21, 2019 |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> He has made the cut 592 times on the PGA Tour, more than any other player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2017/05/20/which-pga-tour-golfer-made-most-cuts-career-105025/ |title=Which PGA Tour golfer has made the most cuts in their career?|date=May 20, 2017 |publisher=Golf News Net |accessdate=March 15, 2020}}</ref> Haas also has the distinction of playing in the most major tournaments without a win, with 87 during his PGA Tour career.\n\nHaas was eligible to play in [[Champions Tour]] (now PGA Tour Champions) events from the start of the 2004 season and he lost to Hale Irwin by one stroke at the [[Senior PGA Championship]] in his first appearance at that level.

He was elected to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in 2004.\n\nAoki was born in [[Abiko, Chiba]], Japan. He was introduced to golf while caddying at the Abiko Golf Club as a schoolboy. He turned professional in 1964. He went on to win more than fifty events on the [[Japan Golf Tour]] between 1972 and 1990, trailing only [[Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki]] on the [[list of golfers with most Japan Golf Tour wins]]. He won the Japan Golf Tour money list five times in six years: 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981. His career earnings are 980&nbsp;million yen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jgto.org/pc/WG03022200Init.do |title=All-time money list on the Japan Tour |access-date=24 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305131329/http://www.jgto.org/pc/WG03022200Init.do |archive-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Aoki won the [[Hawaiian Open]] on the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour]], the first Japanese player to do so, and the [[Panasonic European Open]] on the [[European Tour]]. He also won the prestigious [[HSBC World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]] in England in 1978, which was not a European Tour event at that time, and picked up a win on the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]]. Aoki is also one of nine players in the history of the [[Open Championship]] to shoot a round of just 63 shots (which he achieved in the third round of the [[1980 Open Championship|1980 event]]). Despite this being the joint-best round in the history of the tournament at the time, Aoki would only finish tied for 12th that year.\n\nAoki played 165 times on the PGA Tour between 1974 and 1999, primarily from 1981 to 1990. His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] was a second-place finish to [[Jack Nicklaus]] (by two strokes) in the 1980 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. That finish, combined with his recent record in Japan and around the globe, meant that Aoki would finish 1980 ranked third in the unofficial [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]], a position he would hold at the end of 1981. After the [[Official World Golf Rankings]] debuted in 1986, he was ranked in the top-10 for several weeks in 1987.<ref>[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf 69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking]</ref>\n\nIn December 1984 after receiving an invitation from [[Gary Player]], Aoki traveled to South Africa to participate in the [[Nedbank Golf Challenge|Million Dollar Challenge]].

He was elected to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in 2004.\n\nAoki was born in [[Abiko, Chiba]], Japan. He was introduced to golf while caddying at the Abiko Golf Club as a schoolboy. He turned professional in 1964. He went on to win more than fifty events on the [[Japan Golf Tour]] between 1972 and 1990, trailing only [[Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki]] on the [[list of golfers with most Japan Golf Tour wins]]. He won the Japan Golf Tour money list five times in six years: 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981. His career earnings are 980&nbsp;million yen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jgto.org/pc/WG03022200Init.do |title=All-time money list on the Japan Tour |access-date=24 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305131329/http://www.jgto.org/pc/WG03022200Init.do |archive-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Aoki won the [[Hawaiian Open]] on the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour]], the first Japanese player to do so, and the [[Panasonic European Open]] on the [[European Tour]]. He also won the prestigious [[HSBC World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]] in England in 1978, which was not a European Tour event at that time, and picked up a win on the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]]. Aoki is also one of nine players in the history of the [[Open Championship]] to shoot a round of just 63 shots (which he achieved in the third round of the [[1980 Open Championship|1980 event]]). Despite this being the joint-best round in the history of the tournament at the time, Aoki would only finish tied for 12th that year.\n\nAoki played 165 times on the PGA Tour between 1974 and 1999, primarily from 1981 to 1990. His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] was a second-place finish to [[Jack Nicklaus]] (by two strokes) in the 1980 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. That finish, combined with his recent record in Japan and around the globe, meant that Aoki would finish 1980 ranked third in the unofficial [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]], a position he would hold at the end of 1981.

Thus you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt as long as you live.|[[Deuteronomy]] 16:3|source=}}\n{{quote|For six days you are to eat '''''matzo'''''; on the seventh day there is to be a festive assembly for [[Tetragrammaton|''Ha Shem'']] your God; do not do any kind of work.|[[Deuteronomy]] 16:8|source=}}\n\n==Religious significance==\nThere are numerous explanations behind the symbolism of matzo. One is historical: Passover is a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The biblical narrative relates that the [[Israelites]] left Egypt in such haste they could not wait for their bread dough to rise; the bread, when baked, was matzo. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:39). The other reason for eating matzo is symbolic: On the one hand, matzo symbolizes redemption and freedom, but it is also ''lechem oni'', \"poor man's bread\". Thus it serves as a reminder to be humble, and to not forget what life was like in servitude. Also, leaven symbolizes corruption and pride as leaven \"puffs up\". Eating the \"bread of affliction\" is both a lesson in humility and an act that enhances the appreciation of freedom.\n\nAnother explanation is that matzo has been used to replace the [[pesach]], or the traditional Passover offering that was made before the destruction of the Temple. During the Seder the third time the matzo is eaten it is preceded with the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] rite, \"zekher l'korban pesach hane'ekhal al hasova\". This means \"remembrance of the Passover offering, eaten while full\". This last piece of the matzo eaten is called [[afikoman]] and many explain it as a symbol of salvation in the future.\n\nThe Passover Seder meal is full of symbols of salvation, the closing line, \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]],\" but the use of matzo is the oldest symbol of salvation in the Seder.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul F., and Hoffman, Lawrence A. ''Passover and Easter: The Symbolic Structuring of Sacred Seasons''. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1999.</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\n\n{{Nutritional value\n| note = (Values are for matzo made with [[enriched flour]])\n| kJ              = 1653\n| carbs           = 83.70 g\n| fat             = 1.40 g\n| protein         = 10.00 g\n| water           = 4.30 g\n| calcium_mg      = 13\n| iron_mg         = 3.16\n| phosphorus_mg   = 89\n| magnesium_mg    = 25\n| manganese_mg    = 0.650\n| sodium_mg       = 0\n| potassium_mg    = 112\n| zinc_mg         = 0.68\n| vitA_iu         = 0\n| thiamin_mg      = 0.387\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.291\n| niacin_mg       = 3.892\n| pantothenic_mg  = 0.443\n| vitB6_mg        = 0.115\n| folate_ug       = 17.1\n| source_usda     = 1\n|name=Matzo}}\n\nAt the [[Passover seder]], simple matzo made of flour and water is mandatory.  Sephardic tradition additionally permits the inclusion of eggs in the recipe. The flour must be ground from one of the five grains specified in Jewish law for Passover matzo: wheat, barley, spelt, rye or oat. Per Ashkenazic tradition, matzo made with [[wine]], [[fruit juice]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], etc., is not acceptable for use at any time during the Passover festival except by the elderly or unwell.<ref>Mishna Brurah 462:1 1</ref><ref name=egg />\n\n==Preparation==\nMatzo dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an [[Autolysis (biology)#Use|autolyse]] step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness.  Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzo takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzo bakeries.\n\nAfter baking, matzo may be ground into fine crumbs, known as matzo meal.  Matzo meal can be used like flour during the week of Passover when flour can otherwise be used only to make matzo.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Matzo-forming machine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Matzo-forming machine, ca. early 20th century (the [[Lviv]] Museum of the History of Religion)]]\nThere are two major forms of matzo. In many western countries the most common form is the hard form of matzo which is cracker-like in appearance and taste and is used in all [[Ashkenazic]] and most [[Sephardic]] communities. [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenites]], and [[Iraqi Jews]] traditionally made a form of soft matzo which looks like Greek [[pita]] or like a [[tortilla]]. Soft matzo is made only by hand, and generally with ''shmurah'' flour.<ref name= intime />\n\nFlavored varieties of matzo are produced commercially, such as [[poppy seed]]- or [[onion]]-flavored. Oat and spelt matzo with kosher certification are produced.  Oat matzo is generally suitable for those who cannot eat gluten.  Whole wheat, bran and organic matzo are also available.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://swordsandploughshares.blogspot.com/2007/04/why-is-this-matzah-different-from-all.html |title=On organic matzah |website= Swordsandploughshares.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> [[Chocolate]]-covered matzo is a favorite among children, although some consider it \"enriched matzo\" and will not eat it during the Passover holiday.

There is a custom among some Ashkenazi Jews not to eat them during Passover, except for the elderly, infirm, or children, who cannot digest plain matzo; these matzot are considered to be kosher for Passover if prepared otherwise properly. The issue of whether egg matzo is allowed for Passover comes down to whether there is a difference between the various liquids that can be used.  Water facilitates [[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]] of grain flour, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so.\n[[File:Matsa yey\u0259n u\u015faqlar - 1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Kids eating commercially made matzo.]]\nThe [[Pesachim (Talmud)|''Talmud'', Pesachim 35a]], states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does.

The ''[[Tosafot]]'' (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour ''if'' they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.\n\nAs a result, [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]], author of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' or \"Code of Jewish Law\" ([[Orach Chayim|Orach Chayim 462:4]]) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzo made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzo, on Passover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=168&o=2068731 |title= Is Egg Matzah okay for Passover use?| author= Rabbi Shais Taub of Chabad-Lubavitch |website= Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> Many egg matzo boxes no longer include the message, \"Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzo is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.\" Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be ''eaten'' during Passover, it is permissible to ''retain'' it in the home.\n\n====Chocolate-covered matzo====\n'''Chocolate-covered matzo'''<ref>these are chocolate covered egg matzo, not the subsequently originated \"chocolate matzo\"</ref> was sold in boxes as a standard product, alongside boxes of egg matzo.<ref name=YeaRound>{{cite web\n   |url=https://parade.com/842225/pambeth/chocolate-and-candy-covered-matzo-enjoy-all-year-round\n   |quote=... was a little girl ... on the shelves \n   |author=Pam Beth  |date=April 14, 2017\n   |title=Chocolate and Candy Covered Matzo-Enjoy All Year Round!}}</ref>\n\nThe matzo itself is not ''Hamotzi'' (meaning that it is ''Mezonot'').\n\n== Cooking with matzo ==\n{{main article|Jewish cuisine#Passover}}\n[[File:Matzah balls.JPG|thumb|[[Matzo ball]]s]]\nMatzo may be used whole, broken, chopped (\"matzo [[farfel]]\"), or finely ground (\"matzo meal\") to make numerous matzo-based cooked dishes.

All [[Byzantine Rite]] churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist as this symbolizes the risen Christ.\n\nSome [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] Christians use leavened bread, as in the east there is the tradition, based upon the [[gospel of John]], that leavened bread was on the table of the Last Supper.

One is historical: Passover is a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The biblical narrative relates that the [[Israelites]] left Egypt in such haste they could not wait for their bread dough to rise; the bread, when baked, was matzo. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:39). The other reason for eating matzo is symbolic: On the one hand, matzo symbolizes redemption and freedom, but it is also ''lechem oni'', \"poor man's bread\". Thus it serves as a reminder to be humble, and to not forget what life was like in servitude. Also, leaven symbolizes corruption and pride as leaven \"puffs up\". Eating the \"bread of affliction\" is both a lesson in humility and an act that enhances the appreciation of freedom.\n\nAnother explanation is that matzo has been used to replace the [[pesach]], or the traditional Passover offering that was made before the destruction of the Temple. During the Seder the third time the matzo is eaten it is preceded with the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] rite, \"zekher l'korban pesach hane'ekhal al hasova\". This means \"remembrance of the Passover offering, eaten while full\". This last piece of the matzo eaten is called [[afikoman]] and many explain it as a symbol of salvation in the future.\n\nThe Passover Seder meal is full of symbols of salvation, the closing line, \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]],\" but the use of matzo is the oldest symbol of salvation in the Seder.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul F., and Hoffman, Lawrence A.

Sephardic tradition additionally permits the inclusion of eggs in the recipe. The flour must be ground from one of the five grains specified in Jewish law for Passover matzo: wheat, barley, spelt, rye or oat. Per Ashkenazic tradition, matzo made with [[wine]], [[fruit juice]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], etc., is not acceptable for use at any time during the Passover festival except by the elderly or unwell.<ref>Mishna Brurah 462:1 1</ref><ref name=egg />\n\n==Preparation==\nMatzo dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an [[Autolysis (biology)#Use|autolyse]] step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness.  Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzo takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzo bakeries.\n\nAfter baking, matzo may be ground into fine crumbs, known as matzo meal.  Matzo meal can be used like flour during the week of Passover when flour can otherwise be used only to make matzo.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Matzo-forming machine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Matzo-forming machine, ca. early 20th century (the [[Lviv]] Museum of the History of Religion)]]\nThere are two major forms of matzo. In many western countries the most common form is the hard form of matzo which is cracker-like in appearance and taste and is used in all [[Ashkenazic]] and most [[Sephardic]] communities. [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenites]], and [[Iraqi Jews]] traditionally made a form of soft matzo which looks like Greek [[pita]] or like a [[tortilla]]. Soft matzo is made only by hand, and generally with ''shmurah'' flour.<ref name= intime />\n\nFlavored varieties of matzo are produced commercially, such as [[poppy seed]]- or [[onion]]-flavored.

Water facilitates [[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]] of grain flour, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so.\n[[File:Matsa yey\u0259n u\u015faqlar - 1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Kids eating commercially made matzo.]]\nThe [[Pesachim (Talmud)|''Talmud'', Pesachim 35a]], states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does.  According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would not need to be treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The ''[[Tosafot]]'' (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour ''if'' they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.\n\nAs a result, [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]], author of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' or \"Code of Jewish Law\" ([[Orach Chayim|Orach Chayim 462:4]]) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzo made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzo, on Passover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=168&o=2068731 |title= Is Egg Matzah okay for Passover use?| author= Rabbi Shais Taub of Chabad-Lubavitch |website= Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> Many egg matzo boxes no longer include the message, \"Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzo is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.\" Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be ''eaten'' during Passover, it is permissible to ''retain'' it in the home.\n\n====Chocolate-covered matzo====\n'''Chocolate-covered matzo'''<ref>these are chocolate covered egg matzo, not the subsequently originated \"chocolate matzo\"</ref> was sold in boxes as a standard product, alongside boxes of egg matzo.<ref name=YeaRound>{{cite web\n   |url=https://parade.com/842225/pambeth/chocolate-and-candy-covered-matzo-enjoy-all-year-round\n   |quote=... was a little girl ... on the shelves \n   |author=Pam Beth  |date=April 14, 2017\n   |title=Chocolate and Candy Covered Matzo-Enjoy All Year Round!}}</ref>\n\nThe matzo itself is not ''Hamotzi'' (meaning that it is ''Mezonot'').\n\n== Cooking with matzo ==\n{{main article|Jewish cuisine#Passover}}\n[[File:Matzah balls.JPG|thumb|[[Matzo ball]]s]]\nMatzo may be used whole, broken, chopped (\"matzo [[farfel]]\"), or finely ground (\"matzo meal\") to make numerous matzo-based cooked dishes.

The main reason for the use of this bread is the belief that, because [[the last supper]] was described in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] as a passover meal, the unleavened matzo bread was used by Jesus when he held it up and said \"this is my body\". All [[Byzantine Rite]] churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist as this symbolizes the risen Christ.\n\nSome [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] Christians use leavened bread, as in the east there is the tradition, based upon the [[gospel of John]], that leavened bread was on the table of the Last Supper. In the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], unleavened bread called ''q\u01ddddus qurban'' in [[Ge'ez]], the liturgical language of the Eritreans and Ethiopians, is used for communion.\n\n[[Saint Thomas Christian denominations#Churches within Saint Thomas Christian tradition|Catholic Christians]] living on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[Kerala]], [[India]] have the customary celebration of Pesaha in their homes. On the evening before Good Friday, [[Pesaha Appam|Pesaha bread]] is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they consume a sweet drink made up of [[coconut milk]] and [[jaggery]] along with this bread. On the Pesaha night, the bread is baked (steamed) immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out steam so that the bread will not rise (this custom is called \"juthante kannu kuthal\" in the Malayalam language meaning \"piercing the bread according to the custom of Jews\"). This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members.<ref>{{cite journal| work= Journal of Indo Judaic Studies |url= |number= 13| year= 2013 |pages= 57\u201371| title= [Unknown title] | access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn Israel, the Saint James Vicariate For Hebrew Speaking Catholics uses matzo as the host for the Eucharistic celebration in the Mass as a form of inculturation.\n\n==World War II==\nAt the end of [[World War II]], the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]] had a matzo factory (according to the [[American Jewish Historical Society]], it was probably the [[Manischewitz]] matzo factory in [[New Jersey]]) produce matzo in the form of a giant [[V sign|\"V\" for \"Victory\"]], for shipment to military bases overseas and in the U.S., for [[Passover seder]]s for Jewish military personnel.<ref>[http://www.ajhs.org/hai/entry.cfm?id=27 American Jewish Historical Society, March 22, 2007 retrieved Oct. 21, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070811083827/http://www.ajhs.org/hai/entry.cfm?id=27 |date=August 11, 2007 }}</ref> Passover in 1945 began on 1 April, when the collapse of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in Europe was clearly imminent; [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[German Instrument of Surrender|surrendered]] [[Victory in Europe Day|five weeks later]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Matzah}}\n\n*[http://www.manischewitz.com/product_category/matzo/#cat_matzo/ Manischewitz Matzo Products]\n\n{{Flatbreads}}\n{{Jewish baked goods}}\n{{Passover Footer}}\n\n[[Category:Jewish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Matzo| ]]\n[[Category:Passover]]\n[[Category:Passover foods]]\n[[Category:Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish prayers and blessings]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n", "name_user": "104.33.202.90", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(sterling)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzo"}

The roots of [[Ethiopia]]n historical writing can be traced back to the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (c. AD 100 \u2013 c. 940). These early texts were written in either the Ethiopian [[Ge'ez script]] or the [[Greek alphabet]], and included a variety of mediums such as [[manuscript]]s and [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] inscriptions on monumental [[stelae]] and [[obelisk]]s documenting contemporary events. The writing of history became an established genre in [[Ethiopian literature]] during the early [[Solomonic dynasty]] (1270\u20131974). In this period, written histories were usually in the form of royal biographies and dynastic [[chronicle]]s, supplemented by [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] literature and [[Universal history|universal histories]] in the form of [[annal]]s. [[Christian mythology]] became a linchpin of medieval Ethiopian [[historiography]] due to works such as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Orthodox]] ''[[Kebra Nagast]]''. This reinforced the genealogical traditions of Ethiopia's Solomonic dynasty [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|rulers]], which asserted that they were descendants of [[Solomon]], the legendary [[Kings of Israel and Judah|King of Israel]].\n\nEthiopian historiographic literature has been traditionally dominated by [[Christian theology]] and the [[chronology of the Bible]]. There was also considerable influence from [[Islam|Muslim]], [[pagan]] and foreign elements from within the [[Horn of Africa]] and beyond. Diplomatic ties with [[Christendom]] were established in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] under Ethiopia's first Christian king, [[Ezana of Axum]], in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with embassies traveling to and from [[medieval Europe]]. Building on the legacy of ancient [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman]] historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical [[Prester John]], who was viewed as a potential ally against [[History of Islam|Islamic powers]]. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval [[Historiography of early Islam|Islamic historiography]] and even [[Chinese historiography|Chinese]] [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[travel literature]], and [[Official history|official]] [[Twenty-Four Histories|histories]].\n\nDuring the 16th century and onset of the [[early modern period]], military alliances with the [[Portuguese Empire]] were made, the [[Jesuit]] [[Christian mission|Catholic missionaries]] arrived, and prolonged warfare with [[Islam in Africa|Islamic foes]] including the [[Adal Sultanate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], as well as with the [[polytheistic]] [[Oromo people]], threatened the security of the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of [[ethnography]], by authors such as the monk and historian [[Bahrey]], which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader view in historical [[chronicle]]s for [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's place in the world]]. The [[Jesuit missions|Jesuit missionaries]] [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]] (1564\u20131622) and [[Manuel de Almeida]] (1580\u20131646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of [[Portuguese India]] and was not published in [[Western world|the West]] until modern times.\n\n[[Outline of Ethiopia|Modern Ethiopian]] historiography was developed locally by native Ethiopians as well as by foreign historians, most notably [[Hiob Ludolf]] (1624\u20131704), the German [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] who British historian [[Edward Ullendorff]] (1920\u20132011) considered the founder of [[Ethiopian Studies]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a period where Western historiographic methods were introduced and synthesized with traditionalist practices, embodied by works such as those by [[Heruy Wolde Selassie]] (1878\u20131938). The discipline has since developed new approaches in studying the nation's past and offered criticism of some traditional [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-dominated views that have been prevalent, sometimes at the expense of Ethiopia's traditional ties with the [[Middle East]]. [[Marxist historiography]] and [[African studies]] have also played significant roles in developing the discipline. Since the 20th century, historians have given greater consideration to issues of class, gender, and ethnicity. Traditions pertaining mainly to other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic-speaking]] populations have also been accorded more importance, with literary, linguistic, and archaeological analyses reshaping the perception of their roles in historical Ethiopian society. Historiography of the 20th century focused largely on the [[Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1935 and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], whereas the Ethiopian victory over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]] played a major role in the historiographic literature of these two countries immediately following the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].\n\nphilimon\n\n==Medieval historiography==\n{{further|Ethiopian manuscript collections|Book of Aksum|Giyorgis of Segla|Medieval literature}}\n{{multiple image|width1 = 200 |width2= 238 | image1 = Bete Giyorgis 06.jpg| alt1 = Bete Giyorgis (Church of St. George), Lalibela, Ethiopia.| image2 = St. George Astride His Horse, Church of Bet Giorgis, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3268383996).jpg| alt2 = St. George Astride His Horse, Church of Bet Giorgis, Lalibela, Ethiopia.| footer = The [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela]] and a [[panel painting]] inside depicting [[Saint George]] [[St George and the Dragon|slaying a dragon]]; it is one of eleven monumental [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches built in [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, allegedly under [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe-dynasty]] ruler [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]] (r. 1185\u20131221),{{sfnp|Riches|2015|pp=43\u201344}}{{sfnp|Sobania|2012|p=462}} while archaeology reveals the [[Architecture of Ethiopia|religious structures]] to have been built between the 10th and early 13th centuries.{{sfnp|Sobania|2012|p=462}}}}\n\n===Zagwe dynasty===\nThe power of the Aksumite Kingdom declined after the 6th century due to the rise of other regional states in the [[History of the Horn of Africa|Horn of Africa]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=17}} Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure [[Gudit]] (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum.{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|pp=16\u201317}} The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk [[Tekle Haymanot]], who compiled historical writings gathered from various [[Christianity in Ethiopia|Ethiopian churches and monasteries]].{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|p=16}} The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to [[Judaism]].

The royal biographical genre was established during the reign of [[Amda Seyon I]] (r. 1314\u20131344), whose biography not only recounted the diplomatic exchanges and military conflicts with the rival Islamic powers of the [[Ifat Sultanate]] and [[Adal Sultanate]], but also depicted the Ethiopian ruler as the [[Messiah|Christian savior]] of his nation.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=18}} The origins of the dynastic history (''tarika nagast'') are perhaps found in the biographical [[chronicle]] of [[Baeda Maryam I]] (r. 1468\u20131478), which provides a narrative of his life and that of his children and was most likely written by the [[preceptor]] of the royal court.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=18}} Teshale Tibebu asserts that Ethiopian court historians were \"professional flatterers\" of their ruling monarchs, akin to their [[Byzantine literature#Historians and annalists|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Imperial China|Imperial]] [[Chinese historiography|Chinese counterparts]].{{sfnp|Tibebu|1995|p=13}} For instance, the anonymously written biography of the emperor [[Gelawdewos]] (r. 1540\u20131549) speaks glowingly of the ruler, albeit in an [[elegiac]] tone, while attempting to place him and his deeds within a greater moral and historical context.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=13}}\n\nThere are also [[hagiographies]] of previous Zagwe dynastic rulers composed during the Solomonic period.

The roots of [[Ethiopia]]n historical writing can be traced back to the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (c. AD 100 \u2013 c. 940). These early texts were written in either the Ethiopian [[Ge'ez script]] or the [[Greek alphabet]], and included a variety of mediums such as [[manuscript]]s and [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] inscriptions on monumental [[stelae]] and [[obelisk]]s documenting contemporary events. The writing of history became an established genre in [[Ethiopian literature]] during the early [[Solomonic dynasty]] (1270\u20131974). In this period, written histories were usually in the form of royal biographies and dynastic [[chronicle]]s, supplemented by [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] literature and [[Universal history|universal histories]] in the form of [[annal]]s. [[Christian mythology]] became a linchpin of medieval Ethiopian [[historiography]] due to works such as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Orthodox]] ''[[Kebra Nagast]]''. This reinforced the genealogical traditions of Ethiopia's Solomonic dynasty [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|rulers]], which asserted that they were descendants of [[Solomon]], the legendary [[Kings of Israel and Judah|King of Israel]].\n\nEthiopian historiographic literature has been traditionally dominated by [[Christian theology]] and the [[chronology of the Bible]]. There was also considerable influence from [[Islam|Muslim]], [[pagan]] and foreign elements from within the [[Horn of Africa]] and beyond. Diplomatic ties with [[Christendom]] were established in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] under Ethiopia's first Christian king, [[Ezana of Axum]], in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with embassies traveling to and from [[medieval Europe]]. Building on the legacy of ancient [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman]] historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical [[Prester John]], who was viewed as a potential ally against [[History of Islam|Islamic powers]]. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval [[Historiography of early Islam|Islamic historiography]] and even [[Chinese historiography|Chinese]] [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[travel literature]], and [[Official history|official]] [[Twenty-Four Histories|histories]].\n\nDuring the 16th century and onset of the [[early modern period]], military alliances with the [[Portuguese Empire]] were made, the [[Jesuit]] [[Christian mission|Catholic missionaries]] arrived, and prolonged warfare with [[Islam in Africa|Islamic foes]] including the [[Adal Sultanate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], as well as with the [[polytheistic]] [[Oromo people]], threatened the security of the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of [[ethnography]], by authors such as the monk and historian [[Bahrey]], which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader view in historical [[chronicle]]s for [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's place in the world]]. The [[Jesuit missions|Jesuit missionaries]] [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]] (1564\u20131622) and [[Manuel de Almeida]] (1580\u20131646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of [[Portuguese India]] and was not published in [[Western world|the West]] until modern times.\n\n[[Outline of Ethiopia|Modern Ethiopian]] historiography was developed locally by native Ethiopians as well as by foreign historians, most notably [[Hiob Ludolf]] (1624\u20131704), the German [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] who British historian [[Edward Ullendorff]] (1920\u20132011) considered the founder of [[Ethiopian Studies]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a period where Western historiographic methods were introduced and synthesized with traditionalist practices, embodied by works such as those by [[Heruy Wolde Selassie]] (1878\u20131938). The discipline has since developed new approaches in studying the nation's past and offered criticism of some traditional [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-dominated views that have been prevalent, sometimes at the expense of Ethiopia's traditional ties with the [[Middle East]]. [[Marxist historiography]] and [[African studies]] have also played significant roles in developing the discipline. Since the 20th century, historians have given greater consideration to issues of class, gender, and ethnicity. Traditions pertaining mainly to other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic-speaking]] populations have also been accorded more importance, with literary, linguistic, and archaeological analyses reshaping the perception of their roles in historical Ethiopian society. Historiography of the 20th century focused largely on the [[Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1935 and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], whereas the Ethiopian victory over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]] played a major role in the historiographic literature of these two countries immediately following the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].\n\n==Ancient origins==\n{{further|D\u02bfmt|King Ezana's Stela|Obelisk of Axum|Aethiopia}}\n[[File:Ethio w11.jpg|thumb|alt=Epigraphy in ancient boustrophedon, pre-axoumitic period, found near Aksum \u2013 Aksum museum.|An [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] text in the [[Ancient South Arabian script|Ancient South Arabian]] [[boustrophedon]], from the period preceding the foundation of the Kingdom of Aksum (c. 100 AD), found near Axum, Ethiopia]]\n\nWriting was introduced to Ethiopia [[D\u02bfmt|as far back as the 5th century BC]] with the [[ancient South Arabian script]].{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} This [[South Semitic]] script served as the basis for the creation of Ethiopia's [[Ge'ez]] script, the oldest evidence of which was found in [[Matara, Eritrea]], and dated to the 2nd century AD.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} However, the 1st-century AD [[Latin literature|Roman]] ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' asserts that the local ruler of Adulis could speak and write [[Ancient Greek|in Greek]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=273}} This embrace of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] could also be found in the [[coin]]age of [[Aksumite currency]], in which legends were usually [[History of the Greek alphabet|written in Greek]], much like [[ancient Greek coinage]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=273}}\n\n===Epigraphy===\nThe roots of the [[Historiography|historiographic]] tradition in Ethiopia date back to the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite period]] (c. 100 \u2013 c. 940 AD) and are found in [[epigraphic]] texts commissioned by monarchs to recount the deeds of their reign and royal house. Written in an autobiographical style, in either the native [[Ge'ez script]], the [[Greek alphabet]], or both, they are preserved on [[stelae]], [[throne]]s, and [[obelisk]]s found in a wide geographical span that includes [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]], and Ethiopia.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=14\u201315}} In commemorating the contemporary ruler or aristocrats and elite members of society, these documents record various historical events such as military campaigns, diplomatic missions, and acts of [[philanthropy]]. For instance, 4th-century stelae erected by [[Ezana of Axum]] memorialize his achievements in battle and expansion of the realm in the [[Horn of Africa]], while the ''[[Monumentum Adulitanum]]'' inscribed on a throne in [[Adulis]], Eritrea, contains descriptions of [[Kaleb of Axum]]'s conquests in the [[Red Sea]] region during the 6th century, including parts of the [[Arabian peninsula]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=15}} It is clear that such texts influenced the [[epigraphy]] of later Aksumite rulers who still considered their lost Arabian territories as part of their realm.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Ezana.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin of the Axumite king Ezana.|left|A silver coin of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite]] [[List of kings of Axum|king]] [[Ezana]], mid-4th century AD]]\n\nIn [[Roman historiography]], the [[ecclesiastical]] history of [[Tyrannius Rufinus]], a [[History of Latin|Latin translation]] and extension of the work of [[Eusebius]] dated circa 402, offers an account of the Christian conversion of Ethiopia (labeled as \"India ulterior\") by the missionary [[Frumentius]] of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=273\u2013274}} The text explains that Frumentius, in order to complete this task, was ordained a bishop by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (298\u2013373), most likely after 346 during the latter's third tenure as [[Bishop of Alexandria]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=274\u2013275}} The mission certainly took place before 357, when Athanasius was deposed, replaced by [[George of Cappadocia]], and forced into flight, during which he wrote an apologetic letter to [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantius II]] (r. 337\u2013361) that coincidentally preserved an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] letter to the royal court of Aksum.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=275}} In this letter, Constantius II addresses two \"tyrants\" of Ethiopia, Aizanas and Sazanas, who are undoubtedly Ezana and his brother Saiazana, or Sazanan, a military commander.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=275\u2013276}} The letter also hints that the ruler of Aksum was already a [[Christian monarchy|Christian monarch]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=275}} From the early inscriptions of Ezana's reign it is clear that he was once a [[Polytheism|polytheist]],{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=276}} who erected bronze, silver, and gold statues to [[Ares]], [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god of war]].{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} But the dual Greek and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean-style]] Ge'ez inscriptions on the [[Ezana Stone]], commemorating Ezana's conquests of the [[Kingdom of Kush]] (located in [[Nubia]], i.e. modern Sudan), mention his [[conversion to Christianity]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=276}} \n\n{{multiple image|align = right| total_width = 390| image1 =

Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the [[Sabaeans]] in what is now [[Yemen]], along with other parts of western Arabia.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=372}}{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=277}} Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler [[GDRT|Gadara]], who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the [[Himyar]]ite ruler [[Shammar Yahri'sh]] (r. c. 265 \u2013 c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=277\u2013278}} It is only from Sabaean and [[Himyaritic language|Himyarite inscriptions]] that we know the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs [[`DBH]] and [[DTWNS]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=278}} Inscriptions of king Ezana mention [[Architecture of Ethiopia|stone-carved thrones]] near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary

This objective gradually ebbed due to political tension over control of the [[Nile]] waters.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|pp=5 & 85}} Consequently, after the 1950s, Egyptian scholars adopted a more distant if not apathetic approach to Ethiopian affairs and academic studies.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} For instance, the Fifth Nile 2002 Conference held in [[Addis Ababa]] in 1997 was attended by hundreds of scholars and officials, among whom were 163 Ethiopians and 16 Egyptians.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=11}} By contrast, there were no Egyptian attendees at the Fourteenth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies later held in Addis Ababa in 2000, similar to all previous ICES conferences since the 1960s.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}}\n\nErlich argues that, in deference to their training as [[African studies|Africanists]], native and foreign Ethiopianists of the post-1950 generation focused more on historiographic matters pertaining to Ethiopia's place within the African continent.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} This trend had the effect of marginalizing Ethiopia's traditional bonds with the Middle East in historiographic works.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} In [[Bahru Zewde]]'s retrospective on Ethiopian historiography published in 2000, he highlighted Ethiopia's ancient tradition of historiography, observing that it dates from at least the fourteenth century and distinguishes the territory from most other areas in Africa.{{sfnp|Zewde|2000|p=5}} He also noted a shift in emphasis in Ethiopian studies away from the field's traditional fixation on Ethiopia's northern Semitic-speaking groups, with an increasing focus on the territory's other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking communities. Zewde suggested that this development was made possible by a greater critical usage of oral traditions.{{sfnp|Zewde|2000|p=10}} He offered no survey of Ethiopia's role in [[Middle Eastern studies]] and made no mention of [[Egypt\u2013Ethiopia relations|Egyptian-Ethiopian historical relations]].{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=225, note #19}} Zewde also observed that historiographic studies in Africa were centered on methods and schools that were primarily developed in [[Nigeria]] and [[Tanzania]], and concluded that \"the integration of Ethiopian historiography into the African mainstream, a perennial concern, is still far from being achieved to a satisfactory degree.\"{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=225, note #19}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Outline of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Hatata]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Index of Ethiopia-related articles]]\n* [[Menelik I]]\n* [[Military history of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n* [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)]]\n* [[Rosetta stone]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{citation|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=Ethiopia and the Red Sea: The Rise and Decline of the Solomonic Dynasty and Muslim-European Rivalry in the Region|location=Abingdon, UK|publisher=[[Frank Cass]]|year=1980|isbn=0-7146-3164-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fArBgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Adejumobi|first=Saheed A.|title=The History of Ethiopia|location=Westport, CT|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-32273-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U7aydmefrgC| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Africanus|first=Leo|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Brown|translator=John Pory|title=The History and Description of Africa|location=London|publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1896|orig-year=1600|volume=1|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr03porygoog#page/n150/|postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Anfray|first=F.|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|chapter=The Civilisation of Aksum from the First to the Seventh Century|location=Paris|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2000|orig-year=1981|edition=reprint|isbn=0-435-94805-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3LNzqo5i0IC|editor-last=|editor-first=|pages=362\u2013381|postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Augustyniak|first=Zuzanna|title=Dictionary of African Biography|chapter=Gudit|pp=511\u2013512|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-538207-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ|editor1-first=Emmanuel|editor1-last=Akyeampong|editor2-first=Henry Louis, Jr.|editor2-last=Gates| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Bai|first=Shouyi|author-link=Bai Shouyi|title=A History of Chinese Muslim|location=Beijing|publisher=Zhonghua Shuju|year=2003|isbn=7-101-02890-X|volume=2| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Baldridge|first=Cates|title=Prisoners of Prester John: The Portuguese Mission to Ethiopia in Search of the Mythical King, 1520-1526|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7864-6800-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-UASH0jE5cC| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Bekerie|first=Ayele|title=Themes in Modern African History and Culture: Festschrift for Tekeste Negash|chapter=The 1896 Battle of Adwa and the Forging of the Ethiopian Nation|location=Padua|publisher=Libreria Universitaria|year=2013|isbn=978-88-6292-363-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_C72Gm9kivUC|editor1-last=Berge|editor1-first=Lars|editor2-last=Taddia|editor2-first=Irma|pages=177\u2013192|postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Bizuneh|first=Belete|title=Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review|journal=Northeast African Studies|year=2001|publisher=Michigan State University Press|jstor=41931268|pages=7\u201332|volume=8|number=3|postscript = .|doi=10.1353/nas.2006.0004}}\n* {{citation|last=Brauk\u00e4mper|first=Ulrich|title=Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays|location=M\u00fcnster|publisher=[[Lit Verlag]]|year=2004|isbn=3-8258-5671-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC| postscript = .}}\n* {{citation|last=Budge|first=E.
