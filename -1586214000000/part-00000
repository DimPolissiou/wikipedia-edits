The primary charge against Johnson was violation of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in March 1867, over his [[veto]]. Specifically, he had removed from office [[Edwin M. Stanton]], the [[United States Secretary of War|secretary of war]]\u2014whom the act was largely designed to protect\u2014and attempted to replace him with [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Major General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. (Earlier, while the Congress was not in session, Johnson had suspended Stanton and appointed General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as secretary of war ''[[ad interim]]''.) The impeachment of Andrew Johnson did not lead to his removal from office.\n\nJohnson became the first American president to be impeached on March 2\u20133, 1868, when the House formally adopted the [[articles of impeachment]] and forwarded them to the [[United States Senate]] for {{Linktext|adjudication}}. The trial in the Senate began three days later, with [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] presiding. On May 16, the Senate did not convict Johnson on one of the articles, with the 35\u201319 vote in favor of conviction falling short of the necessary [[two-thirds majority]] by a single vote. A 10-day recess was called before attempting to convict him on additional articles. The delay did not change the outcome, however, as on May 26, the Senate did not convict the president on two articles, both by the same margin, after which the trial was adjourned without considering the remaining eight articles of impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson had important political implications for the [[Separation of powers|balance of federal legislative\u2013executive power]]. It maintained the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy, style, and administration of the office. It also resulted in diminished presidential influence on public policy and overall governing power, fostering a system of governance which [[Woodrow Wilson]] referred to in the 1870s as \"Congressional Government.\"<ref name=JohnsonDA>{{cite web| url=http://millercenter.org/president/johnson/domestic-affairs| last=Varon| first=Elizabeth R.| title=Andrew Johnson: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref> Johnson remained the only U.S. president to have been impeached and face a Senate trial for over a century, until [[Bill Clinton]] became the second [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton |in 1998]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Glass| first=Andrew| title=President Clinton impeached Dec. 19, 1998| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2007/12/president-clinton-impeached-dec-19-1998-007464| date=December 19, 2007| publisher=Politico| accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| website=millercenter.org| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Presidential Reconstruction===\n[[File:Andrew Johnson photo portrait head and shoulders, c1870-1880-Edit1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.85|President [[Andrew Johnson]]]]\nTension between the executive and legislative branches had been high prior to Johnson's ascension to the presidency. Following [[Union Army]] victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] in July 1863, President Lincoln began contemplating the issue of how to bring the South back into the Union. He wished to offer an olive branch to the rebel states by pursuing a lenient plan for their reintegration. The forgiving tone of the president's plan, plus the fact that he implemented it by [[presidential directive]] without consulting Congress, incensed [[Radical Republican]]s, who countered with a more stringent plan. Their proposal for Southern reconstruction, the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], passed both houses of Congress in July 1864, but was [[Pocket veto#United States|pocket vetoed]] by the president and never took effect.<ref name=LincolnDA>{{cite web| url=http://millercenter.org/president/lincoln/domestic-affairs| last=Burlingame| first=Michael| title=Abraham Lincoln: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BCnoAJ>{{cite journal| last=Whittington| first=Keith E.| title=Bill Clinton Was No Andrew Johnson: Comparing Two Impeachments| url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume2/issue2/Whittington2U.Pa.J.Const.L.422(2000).pdf| journal=Journal of Constitutional Law| volume=2| issue=2| publisher=University of Pennsylvania| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| pages=422\u2013465| date=March 2000| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865, just days after the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s [[surrender at Appomattox]], briefly lessened the tension over who would set the terms of peace. The radicals, while suspicious of the new president and his policies, believed, based upon his record, that Andrew Johnson would defer, or at least acquiesce to their hardline proposals. Though a Democrat from Tennessee, Johnson had been a fierce critic of the Southern secession. Then after several states left the Union, including his own, he chose to stay in Washington (rather than resign his U.S. Senate seat), and later, when Union troops occupied Tennessee, Johnson was appointed military governor. While in that position he had exercised his powers with vigor, frequently stating that \"treason must be made odious and traitors punished\".<ref name=BCnoAJ/> Johnson, however, embraced Lincoln's more lenient policies, thus rejecting the Radicals, and setting the stage for a showdown between the president and Congress.<ref>{{cite book| title=Reconstruction: People and Perspectives| editor1-last=Campbell| editor1-first=James M.| editor2-last=Fraser| editor2-first=Rebecca J.| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGmD0Zl27GIC&pg=PR15#v=onepage&q&f=false| page=xv| publisher=ABC-CLIO| location=Santa Barbara, California| date=2008| isbn=978-1-59884-021-6}}</ref> During the first months of [[Presidency of Andrew Johnson|his presidency]], Johnson issued proclamations of general amnesty for most former Confederates, both government and military officers, and oversaw creation of new governments in the hitherto rebellious states{{snd}}governments dominated by ex-Confederate officials.<ref>{{cite book| last=Trefousse| first=Hans L.| title=Andrew Johnson: A Biography| publisher=W.

The tour backfired on Johnson, however, when reports of his undisciplined, vitriolic speeches and ill-advised confrontations with hecklers swept the nation.

Chase]] presiding, and proceeded to develop a set of rules for the trial and its officers.<ref name=AJimpeachUSS/> The extent of Chase's authority as presiding officer to render unilateral rulings was a frequent point of contention during the rules debate and trial. He initially maintained that deciding certain procedural questions on his own was his prerogative; but after the Senate challenged several of his rulings, he gave up making rulings.<ref>{{cite web| last=Gerhardt| first=Michael J.| title=Essays on Article I: Trial of Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref> On one occasion, when he ruled that Johnson should be permitted to present evidence that Thomas' appointment to replace Stanton was intended to provide a test case to challenge the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act, the Senate reversed the ruling.<ref>{{cite book| last=Herrick| first=Neal Q.| title=After Patrick Henry: A Second American Revolution| url=https://archive.org/details/afterpatrickhenr0000herr| url-access=registration| date=2009| page=[https://archive.org/details/afterpatrickhenr0000herr/page/207 207]| publisher=Black Rose Books| location=New York City| isbn=978-1-55164-320-5}}</ref>\n\nWhen it came time for senators to take the [[juror's oath]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] questioned Benjamin Wade's [[impartiality]] and suggested that Wade [[Judicial disqualification|abstain]] from voting due to a conflict of interest. As there was no constitutional provision at the time for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency (accomplished a century later by the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]]), the office had been vacant since Johnson succeeded to the presidency. Therefore, Wade, as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], would, under the [[Presidential Succession Act]] then in force and effect, become president if Johnson were removed from office. Reviled by the Radical Republican majority, Hendricks withdrew his objection a day later and left the matter to Wade's own conscience; he subsequently voted for conviction.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson| last=Hearn| first=Chester G.| publisher=McFarland| location=Jefferson, North Carolina| date=2000| isbn=0-7864-0863-4| url=https://archive.org/details/impeachmentofand00hear}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Foner| first=Eric| author-link=Eric Foner| title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060158514| url-access=registration| year=1988| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=9780062035868| page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060158514/page/336 336]}}</ref>\n\nThe House impeachment committee was made up of: [[John Bingham]], [[George S.

Public interest was so great that the Senate issued admission passes for the first time in its history.

The proceedings began on March 23. Senator [[Garrett Davis]] argued that because not all states were represented in the Senate the trial could not be held and that it should therefore be adjourned. The motion was voted down. After the charges against the president were made, [[Henry Stanbery]] asked for another 30 days to assemble evidence and summon witnesses, saying that in the 10 days previously granted there had only been enough time to prepare the president's reply. [[John A. Logan]] argued that the trial should begin immediately and that Stanbery was only trying to stall for time. The request was turned down in a vote 41 to 12. However, the Senate voted the next day to give the defense six more days to prepare evidence, which was accepted.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Committee on the Judiciary| first1=House of Representatives| last2=Ninety-third Congress| first2=Second Session| title=Impeachment: Selected Materials on Procedure| year=1974| publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office| location=Washington, D.C.| oclc=868888| pages=104\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nThe trial commenced again on March 30. Benjamin Butler opened for the prosecution with a three-hour speech reviewing historical impeachment trials, dating from [[John, King of England|King John of England]]. For days Butler spoke out against Johnson's violations of the Tenure of Office Act and further charged that the president had issued orders directly to Army officers without sending them through General Grant. The defense argued that Johnson had not violated the Tenure of Office Act because President Lincoln did not reappoint Stanton as Secretary of War at the beginning of his second term in 1865 and that he was therefore a leftover appointment from the 1860 cabinet, which removed his protection by the Tenure of Office Act. The prosecution called several witnesses in the course of the proceedings until April 9, when they rested their case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sav95Z-KDZcC|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=207\u2013212|isbn=9781416547495}}</ref>\n\nBenjamin Curtis called attention to the fact that after the House passed the Tenure of Office Act, the Senate had amended it, meaning that it had to return it to a Senate\u2013House conference committee to resolve the differences. He followed up by quoting the minutes of those meetings, which revealed that while the House members made no notes about the fact, their sole purpose was to keep Stanton in office, and the Senate had disagreed. The defense then called their first witness, Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. He did not provide adequate information in the defense's cause and Butler made attempts to use his information to the prosecution's advantage. The next witness was General William T. Sherman, who testified that President Johnson had offered to appoint Sherman to succeed Stanton as secretary of war in order to ensure that the department was effectively administered. This testimony damaged the prosecution, which expected Sherman to testify that Johnson offered to appoint Sherman for the purpose of obstructing the operation, or overthrow, of the government. Sherman essentially affirmed that Johnson only wanted him to manage the department and not to execute directions to the military that would be contrary to the will of Congress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=231}}</ref>\n\n===Verdict===\n[[File:Two admission cards to the U.S. Senate impeachment proceedings (for President Andrew Johnson), May 16, 1868.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|Andrew Johnson impeachment trial admission ticket dated March 24, 1868]]\nThe Senate was composed of 54 members representing 27 states (10 former Confederate states had not yet been readmitted to representation in the Senate) at the time of the trial. At its conclusion, senators voted on three of the articles of impeachment. On each occasion the vote was 35\u201319, with 35 senators voting ''guilty'' and 19 ''not guilty''. As the constitutional threshold for a conviction in an impeachment trial is a [[two-thirds majority]] guilty vote, 36 votes in this instance, Johnson was not convicted. He remained in  office through the end of his term on March 4, 1869, though as a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] without influence on public policy.<ref name=JohnsonDA/>\n\nSeven Republican senators were concerned that the proceedings had been manipulated to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators [[William P. Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\"].</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]], who provided the decisive vote,<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party by voting against conviction. In addition to the aforementioned seven, three more Republicans [[James Dixon]], [[James Rood Doolittle]], [[Daniel Sheldon Norton]], and all nine Democratic senators voted not guilty.\n\nThe first vote was taken on May 16 for the eleventh article. Prior to the vote, Samuel Pomeroy, the senior senator from Kansas, told the junior Kansas Senator Ross that if Ross voted for acquittal that Ross would become the subject of an investigation for bribery.<ref>Curt Anders \"Powerlust: Radicalism in the Civil War Era\" p. 531</ref> Afterward, in hopes of persuading at least one senator who voted not guilty to change his vote, the Senate adjourned for 10 days before continuing voting on the other articles. During the hiatus, under Butler's leadership, the House put through a resolution to investigate alleged \"improper or corrupt means used to influence the determination of the Senate.\" Despite the Radical Republican leadership's heavy-handed efforts to change the outcome, when votes were cast on May 26 for the second and third articles, the results were the same as the first. After the trial, Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal. In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash bribes. Political deals were struck as well. Grimes received assurances that acquittal would not be followed by presidential reprisals; Johnson agreed to enforce the Reconstruction Acts, and to appoint General [[John Schofield]] to succeed Stanton. Nonetheless, the investigations never resulted in charges, much less convictions, against anyone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=240\u2013249, 284\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that the prosecution attempted to bribe the senators voting for acquittal to switch their votes to conviction. Maine Senator Fessenden was offered the ministership to Great Britain. Prosecutor Butler said, \"Tell [Kansas Senator Ross] that if he wants money there is a bushel of it here to be had.\"<ref>Gene Davis ''High Crimes and Misdemeanors (New York: William Morrow & Company, 1977), 266\u20137, 290\u20131''</ref> Butler's investigation also boomeranged when it was discovered that Kansas Senator Pomeroy, who voted for conviction, had written a letter to Johnson's postmaster general seeking a $40,000 bribe for Pomeroy's acquittal vote along with three or four others in his caucus.<ref>Curt Anders \"Powerlust: Radicalism in the Civil War Era,\" p. 532-3</ref> Butler was himself told by Wade that Wade would appoint Butler as secretary of state when Wade assumed the presidency after a Johnson conviction.<ref>Eric McKitrick \"Andrew Johnson\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), 507\u20138</ref> An opinion that Senator Ross was mercilessly persecuted for his courageous vote to sustain the independence of the presidency as a branch of the federal government is the subject of an entire chapter in President John F.

Blinded by partisan zeal, with such an example before them, they will not scruple to remove out of the way any obstacle to the accomplishment of their purposes, and what then becomes of the checks and balances of the Constitution, so carefully devised and so vital to its perpetuity?

The primary charge against Johnson was violation of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in March 1867, over his [[veto]]. Specifically, he had removed from office [[Edwin M. Stanton]], the [[United States Secretary of War|secretary of war]]\u2014whom the act was largely designed to protect\u2014and attempted to replace him with [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Major General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. (Earlier, while the Congress was not in session, Johnson had suspended Stanton and appointed General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as secretary of war ''[[ad interim]]''.)\n\nJohnson became the first American president to be impeached on March 2\u20133, 1868, when the House formally adopted the [[articles of impeachment]] and forwarded them to the [[United States Senate]] for {{Linktext|adjudication}}. The trial in the Senate began three days later, with [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] presiding. On May 16, the Senate did not convict Johnson on one of the articles, with the 35\u201319 vote in favor of conviction falling short of the necessary [[two-thirds majority]] by a single vote. A 10-day recess was called before attempting to convict him on additional articles. The delay did not change the outcome, however, as on May 26, the Senate did not convict the president on two articles, both by the same margin, after which the trial was adjourned without considering the remaining eight articles of impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson had important political implications for the [[Separation of powers|balance of federal legislative\u2013executive power]]. It maintained the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy, style, and administration of the office. It also resulted in diminished presidential influence on public policy and overall governing power, fostering a system of governance which [[Woodrow Wilson]] referred to in the 1870s as \"Congressional Government.\"<ref name=JohnsonDA>{{cite web| url=http://millercenter.org/president/johnson/domestic-affairs| last=Varon| first=Elizabeth R.| title=Andrew Johnson: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref> Johnson remained the only U.S. president to have been impeached and face a Senate trial for over a century, until [[Bill Clinton]] became the second [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton |in 1998]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Glass| first=Andrew| title=President Clinton impeached Dec. 19, 1998| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2007/12/president-clinton-impeached-dec-19-1998-007464| date=December 19, 2007| publisher=Politico| accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| website=millercenter.org| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Presidential Reconstruction===\n[[File:Andrew Johnson photo portrait head and shoulders, c1870-1880-Edit1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.85|President [[Andrew Johnson]]]]\nTension between the executive and legislative branches had been high prior to Johnson's ascension to the presidency. Following [[Union Army]] victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] in July 1863, President Lincoln began contemplating the issue of how to bring the South back into the Union. He wished to offer an olive branch to the rebel states by pursuing a lenient plan for their reintegration. The forgiving tone of the president's plan, plus the fact that he implemented it by [[presidential directive]] without consulting Congress, incensed [[Radical Republican]]s, who countered with a more stringent plan. Their proposal for Southern reconstruction, the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], passed both houses of Congress in July 1864, but was [[Pocket veto#United States|pocket vetoed]] by the president and never took effect.<ref name=LincolnDA>{{cite web| url=http://millercenter.org/president/lincoln/domestic-affairs| last=Burlingame| first=Michael| title=Abraham Lincoln: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BCnoAJ>{{cite journal| last=Whittington| first=Keith E.| title=Bill Clinton Was No Andrew Johnson: Comparing Two Impeachments| url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume2/issue2/Whittington2U.Pa.J.Const.L.422(2000).pdf| journal=Journal of Constitutional Law| volume=2| issue=2| publisher=University of Pennsylvania| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| pages=422\u2013465| date=March 2000| accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865, just days after the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s [[surrender at Appomattox]], briefly lessened the tension over who would set the terms of peace. The radicals, while suspicious of the new president and his policies, believed, based upon his record, that Andrew Johnson would defer, or at least acquiesce to their hardline proposals. Though a Democrat from Tennessee, Johnson had been a fierce critic of the Southern secession. Then after several states left the Union, including his own, he chose to stay in Washington (rather than resign his U.S. Senate seat), and later, when Union troops occupied Tennessee, Johnson was appointed military governor. While in that position he had exercised his powers with vigor, frequently stating that \"treason must be made odious and traitors punished\".<ref name=BCnoAJ/> Johnson, however, embraced Lincoln's more lenient policies, thus rejecting the Radicals, and setting the stage for a showdown between the president and Congress.<ref>{{cite book| title=Reconstruction: People and Perspectives| editor1-last=Campbell| editor1-first=James M.| editor2-last=Fraser| editor2-first=Rebecca J.| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGmD0Zl27GIC&pg=PR15#v=onepage&q&f=false| page=xv| publisher=ABC-CLIO| location=Santa Barbara, California| date=2008| isbn=978-1-59884-021-6}}</ref> During the first months of [[Presidency of Andrew Johnson|his presidency]], Johnson issued proclamations of general amnesty for most former Confederates, both government and military officers, and oversaw creation of new governments in the hitherto rebellious states{{snd}}governments dominated by ex-Confederate officials.<ref>{{cite book| last=Trefousse| first=Hans L.| title=Andrew Johnson: A Biography| publisher=W.

The tour backfired on Johnson, however, when reports of his undisciplined, vitriolic speeches and ill-advised confrontations with hecklers swept the nation.

The motion was voted down. After the charges against the president were made, [[Henry Stanbery]] asked for another 30 days to assemble evidence and summon witnesses, saying that in the 10 days previously granted there had only been enough time to prepare the president's reply. [[John A. Logan]] argued that the trial should begin immediately and that Stanbery was only trying to stall for time. The request was turned down in a vote 41 to 12.

Benjamin Butler opened for the prosecution with a three-hour speech reviewing historical impeachment trials, dating from [[John, King of England|King John of England]]. For days Butler spoke out against Johnson's violations of the Tenure of Office Act and further charged that the president had issued orders directly to Army officers without sending them through General Grant. The defense argued that Johnson had not violated the Tenure of Office Act because President Lincoln did not reappoint Stanton as Secretary of War at the beginning of his second term in 1865 and that he was therefore a leftover appointment from the 1860 cabinet, which removed his protection by the Tenure of Office Act. The prosecution called several witnesses in the course of the proceedings until April 9, when they rested their case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sav95Z-KDZcC|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=207\u2013212|isbn=9781416547495}}</ref>\n\nBenjamin Curtis called attention to the fact that after the House passed the Tenure of Office Act, the Senate had amended it, meaning that it had to return it to a Senate\u2013House conference committee to resolve the differences. He followed up by quoting the minutes of those meetings, which revealed that while the House members made no notes about the fact, their sole purpose was to keep Stanton in office, and the Senate had disagreed. The defense then called their first witness, Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. He did not provide adequate information in the defense's cause and Butler made attempts to use his information to the prosecution's advantage. The next witness was General William T. Sherman, who testified that President Johnson had offered to appoint Sherman to succeed Stanton as secretary of war in order to ensure that the department was effectively administered. This testimony damaged the prosecution, which expected Sherman to testify that Johnson offered to appoint Sherman for the purpose of obstructing the operation, or overthrow, of the government. Sherman essentially affirmed that Johnson only wanted him to manage the department and not to execute directions to the military that would be contrary to the will of Congress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=231}}</ref>\n\n===Verdict===\n[[File:Two admission cards to the U.S. Senate impeachment proceedings (for President Andrew Johnson), May 16, 1868.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|Andrew Johnson impeachment trial admission ticket dated March 24, 1868]]\nThe Senate was composed of 54 members representing 27 states (10 former Confederate states had not yet been readmitted to representation in the Senate) at the time of the trial. At its conclusion, senators voted on three of the articles of impeachment. On each occasion the vote was 35\u201319, with 35 senators voting ''guilty'' and 19 ''not guilty''. As the constitutional threshold for a conviction in an impeachment trial is a [[two-thirds majority]] guilty vote, 36 votes in this instance, Johnson was not convicted. He remained in  office through the end of his term on March 4, 1869, though as a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] without influence on public policy.<ref name=JohnsonDA/>\n\nSeven Republican senators were concerned that the proceedings had been manipulated to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators [[William P. Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\"].</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]], who provided the decisive vote,<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party by voting against conviction. In addition to the aforementioned seven, three more Republicans [[James Dixon]], [[James Rood Doolittle]], [[Daniel Sheldon Norton]], and all nine Democratic senators voted not guilty.\n\nThe first vote was taken on May 16 for the eleventh article. Prior to the vote, Samuel Pomeroy, the senior senator from Kansas, told the junior Kansas Senator Ross that if Ross voted for acquittal that Ross would become the subject of an investigation for bribery.<ref>Curt Anders \"Powerlust: Radicalism in the Civil War Era\" p. 531</ref> Afterward, in hopes of persuading at least one senator who voted not guilty to change his vote, the Senate adjourned for 10 days before continuing voting on the other articles. During the hiatus, under Butler's leadership, the House put through a resolution to investigate alleged \"improper or corrupt means used to influence the determination of the Senate.\" Despite the Radical Republican leadership's heavy-handed efforts to change the outcome, when votes were cast on May 26 for the second and third articles, the results were the same as the first. After the trial, Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal. In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash bribes. Political deals were struck as well. Grimes received assurances that acquittal would not be followed by presidential reprisals; Johnson agreed to enforce the Reconstruction Acts, and to appoint General [[John Schofield]] to succeed Stanton. Nonetheless, the investigations never resulted in charges, much less convictions, against anyone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=David O.|title=Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=240\u2013249, 284\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that the prosecution attempted to bribe the senators voting for acquittal to switch their votes to conviction. Maine Senator Fessenden was offered the ministership to Great Britain. Prosecutor Butler said, \"Tell [Kansas Senator Ross] that if he wants money there is a bushel of it here to be had.\"<ref>Gene Davis ''High Crimes and Misdemeanors (New York: William Morrow & Company, 1977), 266\u20137, 290\u20131''</ref> Butler's investigation also boomeranged when it was discovered that Kansas Senator Pomeroy, who voted for conviction, had written a letter to Johnson's postmaster general seeking a $40,000 bribe for Pomeroy's acquittal vote along with three or four others in his caucus.<ref>Curt Anders \"Powerlust: Radicalism in the Civil War Era,\" p. 532-3</ref> Butler was himself told by Wade that Wade would appoint Butler as secretary of state when Wade assumed the presidency after a Johnson conviction.<ref>Eric McKitrick \"Andrew Johnson\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), 507\u20138</ref> An opinion that Senator Ross was mercilessly persecuted for his courageous vote to sustain the independence of the presidency as a branch of the federal government is the subject of an entire chapter in President John F.

''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'' March 28, 1868]]\nIn 1887, the Tenure of Office Act was repealed by Congress, and subsequent rulings by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] seemed to support Johnson's position that he was entitled to fire Stanton without congressional approval. The Supreme Court's ruling on a similar piece of later legislation in ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' (1926) affirmed the ability of the president to remove a [[postmaster]] without congressional approval, and stated in its majority opinion \"that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867...was invalid.\"<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=272&invol=52 MYERS v. UNITED STATES], Findlaw {{!}} Cases and Codes</ref>\n\nLyman Trumbull of Illinois, one of the 10 Republican senators whose refusal to vote for conviction prevented Johnson's removal from office, noted, in the speech he gave explaining his vote for acquittal, that had Johnson been convicted, the main source of the president's political power\u2014the freedom to disagree with the Congress without consequences\u2014would have been destroyed, and the Constitution's system of checks and balances along with it:<ref>White, Horace. ''The Life of Lyman Trumble.'' Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1913, p. 319.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Once set the example of impeaching a President for what, when the excitement of the hour shall have subsided, will be regarded as insufficient causes, as several of those now alleged against the President were decided to be by the House of Representatives only a few months since, and no future President will be safe who happens to differ with a majority of the House and two thirds of the Senate on any measure deemed by them important, particularly if of a political character. Blinded by partisan zeal, with such an example before them, they will not scruple to remove out of the way any obstacle to the accomplishment of their purposes, and what then becomes of the checks and balances of the Constitution, so carefully devised and so vital to its perpetuity? They are all gone.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon]]\n* [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]]\n* [[Impeachment of Donald Trump]]\n* [[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Benedict, Michael Les. \"A New Look at the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson,\" ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Sep 1973, Vol. 88 Issue 3, pp 349\u2013367 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2148988 in JSTOR]\n* Benedict, Michael Les.

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n<br />\n==Main sights==\n* The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia.

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842.
