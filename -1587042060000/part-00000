{"title_page": "Metre", "text_new": "{{About|the unit of length|other uses of \"metre\" or \"meter\"|Meter (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|SI unit of length}}\n\n\nThe '''metre''' (Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling) or '''meter''' (American spelling) (from the French unit ''m\u00e8tre'', from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"measure\") is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). The SI unit symbol is '''m'''.\nThe metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in {{sfrac|1|299 792 458}} of a second.\nThe metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle, so the Earth's circumference is approximately {{val|40000}}&nbsp;km. In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.\n\n== Spelling ==\n''Metre'' is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations except the United States<ref>The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) uses the spelling ''metre''; an English translation, included to make the SI standard more widely accessible also uses the spelling ''metre'' ([[#bipm2006|BIPM, 2006]], p. 130''ff''). However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) chose to use the spelling ''meter'' in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[#turner|Turner]]). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication ''{{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s}} (SI)'' (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii]]). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with [[#taylor2008b|Taylor and Thompson (2008b)]], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([[#turner|Turner]]). Thus, the spelling ''metre'' is referred to as the \"international spelling\"; the spelling ''meter'', as the \"American spelling\".</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/Spelling_metre_or_meter.pdf |title=Spelling metre or meter |first=Pat |last=Naughtin |website=Metrication Matters |year=2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://grammarist.com/spelling/meter-metre/ |title=Meter vs. metre |website=Grammarist |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> and the Philippines,<ref>The Philippines uses [[Philippine English|English]] as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States.

This range of uses is also found in Latin (''metior'', ''mensura''), French (''m\u00e8tre'', ''mesure''), English and other languages.

The BIPM's [[Temperature measurement|thermometry]] work led to the discovery of special alloys of iron-nickel, in particular [[invar]], for which its director, the Swiss physicist [[Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume|Charles-Edouard Guillaume]], was granted the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for physics]] in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/evolution_metre.html|title=BIPM \u2013 la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GPS-IIR.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIR satellite in orbit.|alt=|left]]\n\nAs [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] stated, the progress of [[metrology]] combined with those of [[gravimetry]] through improvement of [[Kater's pendulum]] led to a new era of [[geodesy]]. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, the latter could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the standards for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimetre would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]], the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe. In 1886 the association of geodesy changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]], which [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] presided up to his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] (German: ''Internationale Erdmessung'') gained worldwide importance with the joining of [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Soler\"/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of [[krypton-86]]. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.\n\n== Spelling ==\n''Metre'' is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations except the United States<ref>The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) uses the spelling ''metre''; an English translation, included to make the SI standard more widely accessible also uses the spelling ''metre'' ([[#bipm2006|BIPM, 2006]], p. 130''ff''). However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) chose to use the spelling ''meter'' in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[#turner|Turner]]). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication ''{{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s}} (SI)'' (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii]]). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with [[#taylor2008b|Taylor and Thompson (2008b)]], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([[#turner|Turner]]). Thus, the spelling ''metre'' is referred to as the \"international spelling\"; the spelling ''meter'', as the \"American spelling\".</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/Spelling_metre_or_meter.pdf |title=Spelling metre or meter |first=Pat |last=Naughtin |website=Metrication Matters |year=2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://grammarist.com/spelling/meter-metre/ |title=Meter vs. metre |website=Grammarist |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> and the Philippines,<ref>The Philippines uses [[Philippine English|English]] as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States.

This range of uses is also found in Latin (''metior'', ''mensura''), French (''m\u00e8tre'', ''mesure''), English and other languages.  The motto ''\u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9 \u03a7\u03a1\u03a9'' (metro chro) in the seal of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM), which was a saying of the Greek statesman and philosopher [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] and may be translated as \"Use measure!\", thus calls for both measurement and moderation.

They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as 3269 thousand [[toise]]s. Picard's geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the magnitude of the Earth considered as a sphere, but the discovery made by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form.

The [[Metre Convention]] (''Convention du M\u00e8tre'') of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM: ''{{lang|fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}'') to be located in [[S\u00e8vres]], France. This new organisation was to construct and preserve a prototype metre bar, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation distributed such bars in 1889 at the first [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures}}''), establishing the ''[[International Prototype Metre]]'' as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]], measured at the melting point of ice.<ref>[[#nistmetre|National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter)]]</ref>\n\nThe comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale. The BIPM's [[Temperature measurement|thermometry]] work led to the discovery of special alloys of iron-nickel, in particular [[invar]], for which its director, the Swiss physicist [[Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume|Charles-Edouard Guillaume]], was granted the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for physics]] in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/evolution_metre.html|title=BIPM \u2013 la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GPS-IIR.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIR satellite in orbit.|alt=|left]]\n\nAs [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] stated, the progress of [[metrology]] combined with those of [[gravimetry]] through improvement of [[Kater's pendulum]] led to a new era of [[geodesy]]. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, the latter could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the standards for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimetre would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]], the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe. In 1886 the association of geodesy changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]], which [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] presided up to his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] (German: ''Internationale Erdmessung'') gained worldwide importance with the joining of [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Soler\"/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

The conversion of a length in wavelengths to a length in metres is based upon the relation\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{c}{n f} </math>\n\nwhich converts the unit of wavelength ''&lambda;'' to metres using ''c'', the speed of light in vacuum in m/s. Here ''n'' is the [[refractive index]] of the medium in which the measurement is made, and ''f'' is the measured frequency of the source.

It is part of the [[Boulder Valley School District]].\n\nBoulder High School was founded in 1875 as a preparatory school to the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]]. In 1876, it was the first high school in Colorado to graduate a class. The school is located in downtown Boulder, adjacent to the university\u2019s campus and four blocks from the [[Pearl Street Mall]].\n\n== Construction ==\nBoulder High School's building at 1604 Arapahoe Avenue was constructed in 1933 by the [[Works Project Administration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boulderhistorymuseum.org/timeline.asp |title=Timeline |publisher=Boulder History Museum |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813142039/http://www.boulderhistorymuseum.org/timeline.asp |archivedate=2010-08-13 }}</ref> The facade is classic [[Streamline Moderne]]. The school's art deco auditorium has also been preserved. The building was constructed with \"Colorado Red\" flagstone and limestone, the same materials from which the University of Colorado is built. With funding from a Boulder Valley School District (BVSD) bond program, parts of the school were renovated or expanded in 2008. The changes include a remodeled ESL wing and counseling office, a new gymnasium, a larger administrative wing, and a bigger auditorium backstage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bvsd.org/bondproject/schools/Pages/boulder.aspx |title=Boulder High School |publisher=Boulder Valley School District |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> Most of the school's recent additions also have flagstone facades, but none retain the original art deco design.\n\n=== Stadium ===\nBoulder High football, soccer, lacrosse, and track teams compete at Christian Recht Field, accessed via a bridge spanning Boulder Creek. Recht Field received a multimillion-dollar upgrade in 2003, which included artificial turf installation to conserve water and reduce injuries caused by frozen turf during the winter. As part of the BVSD bond program, a visitors' field house was constructed at the west end of the field.\n\nFairview High School shares Recht Field for a number of varsity-level events. When Boulder and Fairview football compete against each other in the annual Boulder-Fairview duel, the schools' fans alternate use of the visitor and home stands each year.\n\n=== Flood danger ===\nBoulder High School is in the middle of the [[Boulder Creek (Colorado)|Boulder Creek]] flood zone. The school's adjacent soccer fields were the site of housing as late as the 1970s, but the houses were removed due to the flash-flood risk. The City of Boulder continues to remove residential buildings in the path of the most dangerous portions of the creek, replacing them with parks and fields. The Boulder Creek [[100-year flood]] took place in 1894, destroying all buildings in the area. The [[2013 Colorado floods]] caused the school to be closed for several days. Serious water damage was reported in several areas of the building, including many classrooms, the weight room, and the cafeteria. The soccer fields flooded, as did the softball field, which was the most damaged.{{OR|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Attendance zone ==\nThe neighborhood attendance zone for Boulder High School includes the North and central portions of Boulder and the mountain communities to the West of Boulder.<ref>\"[http://bvsd.org/schoolfinder2/high/High%20Boundary%20Map/HS_No1_-_BOULDER_HS_Area.jpg Boulder H.S.

In this group, students take on the roles of diplomats from countries around the globe to discuss, debate, and propose solutions to today's pressing international issues. Students research and prepare elaborate presentations for both in-state and national Model UN conferences, attempting to compete with delegations represented by schools in Colorado. Boulder MUN has consistently proven itself an outstanding team, recognized throughout the state for the quality of their conference, BHSMUN, and for their numerous awards in competition. Boulder MUN attends a national conference each year and has brought home awards. In 2008 and 2009, Boulder established itself, winning the majority of all delegate awards at every conference attended in the state of Colorado.\n\n=== FIRST Robotics ===\nThe FIRST Robotics club was founded in 2003.

The panels have been well attended by BHS students, have typically been supported by the faculty, and despite a focus on politically sensitive issues, have caused little public controversy with the exception of one on April 10, 2007.\n\nThe panel, entitled \"STDs: Sex, Teens, and Drugs,\" was to debate the merits of teens' different attitudes toward sex and drugs. According to some, the views presented by panel member Dr. Joel Becker, an associate clinical professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], were too extreme. Becker allegedly encouraged students to have sex and use illegal drugs, told them where to easily find [[marijuana]], and poked fun at condom use. Others argue that the objections were unfounded, and he was taken out of context.<ref>[http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ BSVDWatch.org \u2013 Complete Transcript of CWA panel at B.H.S] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022001332/http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ |date=October 22, 2007 }}</ref> A transcript of the panel is available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022001332/http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ BVSDWatch.org].\n\nA Boulder High sophomore and her mother, Priscilla White, complained to the school board and protested some teachers' mandatory panel attendance policy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Amy Boundsdailycamera.com |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13079531 |title=Student complains about CWA sex panel |publisher=[[Daily Camera]] |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> The board reviewed the case, but meanwhile, the complaint attracted the national media's attention.

It is part of the [[Boulder Valley School District]].\n\nBoulder High School was founded in 1875 as a preparatory school to the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]]. In 1876, it was the first high school in Colorado to graduate a class. The school is located in downtown Boulder, adjacent to the university\u2019s campus and four blocks from the [[Pearl Street Mall]].\n\n== Construction ==\nBoulder High School's building at 1604 Arapahoe Avenue was constructed in 1933 by the [[Works Project Administration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boulderhistorymuseum.org/timeline.asp |title=Timeline |publisher=Boulder History Museum |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813142039/http://www.boulderhistorymuseum.org/timeline.asp |archivedate=2010-08-13 }}</ref> The facade is classic [[Streamline Moderne]]. The school's art deco auditorium has also been preserved. The building was constructed with \"Colorado Red\" flagstone and limestone, the same materials from which the University of Colorado is built. With funding from a Boulder Valley School District (BVSD) bond program, parts of the school were renovated or expanded in 2008. The changes include a remodeled ESL wing and counseling office, a new gymnasium, a larger administrative wing, and a bigger auditorium backstage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bvsd.org/bondproject/schools/Pages/boulder.aspx |title=Boulder High School |publisher=Boulder Valley School District |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> Most of the school's recent additions also have flagstone facades, but none retain the original art deco design.\n\n=== Stadium ===\nBoulder High football, soccer, lacrosse, and track teams compete at Christian Recht Field, accessed via a bridge spanning Boulder Creek. Recht Field received a multimillion-dollar upgrade in 2003, which included artificial turf installation to conserve water and reduce injuries caused by frozen turf during the winter. As part of the BVSD bond program, a visitors' field house was constructed at the west end of the field.\n\nFairview High School shares Recht Field for a number of varsity-level events. When Boulder and Fairview football compete against each other in the annual Boulder-Fairview duel, the schools' fans alternate use of the visitor and home stands each year.\n\n=== Flood danger ===\nBoulder High School is in the middle of the [[Boulder Creek (Colorado)|Boulder Creek]] flood zone. The school's adjacent soccer fields were the site of housing as late as the 1970s, but the houses were removed due to the flash-flood risk. The City of Boulder continues to remove residential buildings in the path of the most dangerous portions of the creek, replacing them with parks and fields. The Boulder Creek [[100-year flood]] took place in 1894, destroying all buildings in the area. The [[2013 Colorado floods]] caused the school to be closed for several days. Serious water damage was reported in several areas of the building, including many classrooms, the weight room, and the cafeteria. The soccer fields flooded, as did the softball field, which was the most damaged.{{OR|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Attendance zone ==\nThe neighborhood attendance zone for Boulder High School includes the North and central portions of Boulder and the mountain communities to the West of Boulder.<ref>\"[http://bvsd.org/schoolfinder2/high/High%20Boundary%20Map/HS_No1_-_BOULDER_HS_Area.jpg Boulder H.S.

Boulder MUN has consistently proven itself an outstanding team, recognized throughout the state for the quality of their conference, BHSMUN, and for their numerous awards in competition. Boulder MUN attends a national conference each year, and has brought home awards.

The panels have been well attended by BHS students, have typically been supported by the faculty, and despite a focus on politically sensitive issues, have caused little public controversy with the exception of one on April 10, 2007.\n\nThe panel, entitled \"STDs: Sex, Teens, and Drugs,\" was to debate the merits of teens' different attitudes toward sex and drugs. According to some, the views presented by panel member Dr. Joel Becker, an associate clinical professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], were too extreme. Becker allegedly encouraged students to have sex and use illegal drugs, told them where to easily find [[marijuana]], and poked fun at condom use. Others argue that the objections were unfounded, and he was taken out of context.<ref>[http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ BSVDWatch.org \u2013 Complete Transcript of CWA panel at B.H.S] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022001332/http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ |date=October 22, 2007 }}</ref> A transcript of the panel is available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022001332/http://www.bvsdwatch.org/content/view/91/1/ BVSDWatch.org].\n\nA Boulder High sophomore and her mother, Priscilla White, complained to the school board and protested some teachers' mandatory panel attendance policy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Amy Boundsdailycamera.com |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13079531 |title=Student complains about CWA sex panel |publisher=[[Daily Camera]] |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> The board reviewed the case, but meanwhile, the complaint attracted the national media's attention.
