One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and attacked at first light, as per their rules of engagement for this context. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

He sort of nodded and gave me a warm sympathetic smile and said, \"I forgive you.\"<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\" /></blockquote>For Hastie, the death of the boys was both personally affecting and a turning point in his political outlook:<blockquote>I just felt sick... It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

It has a ward population (Conisbrough and Denaby) of 14,333.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Conisbrough and Denaby - UK Census Data 2011|url = http://www.ukcensusdata.com/conisbrough-and-denaby-e05001004#sthash.oYwSg30X.dpbs|website = UK Census Data|access-date = 13 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Conisbrough'' comes from the Old English 'carpet muucnher (first recorded {{circa|1000}}) meaning \"king's stronghold\" or \"king's fortified place\".<ref>'Conquest, Anarchy and Lordship: Yorkshire, 1066-1154' By Paul Dalton, Cambridge University Press, 2002,{{ISBN|0-521-52464-4}}, pp. 34</ref><ref>'Conisbrough Castle' by Michael Welman Thompson, Great Britain.

In a will of around 1003, Conisbrough was bequeathed by [[Wulfric Spott]], founder of [[Burton Abbey]].  At this point, it appears to have been the centre of a major former royal estate, reaching [[Hatfield Chase]].  The manor became royal again under [[Harold II of England]], and by the [[Norman Conquest]], 28 townships in what is now South Yorkshire belonged to the Lord of Conisbrough.  [[William the Conqueror]] gave the whole lordship to [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]].<ref name=\"hey\" />\n\nThe name of Conisbrough relates to a king's stronghold and this is usually presumed to have either been on the site of [[Conisbrough Castle]], or of the parish church. At the time of the Norman Conquest the manor of Conisbrough was held by King Harold - he was defeated at the Battle of Hastings. Conisbrough Castle is contained within an artificial oval-shaped enclosure similar to one used as [[wapentake]] meeting-places at [[Gringley-on-the-Hill]] and [[East Markham]], leading Malcolm Dolby to suppose the castle site may have once been the meeting-place of the [[Strafforth and Tickhill]] wapentake.<ref name=\"hey\" />\n[[File:St.Peter's church - geograph.org.uk - 922213.jpg|thumb|left|180px|St Peter's Church, Conisbrough]]\nConisbrough contains what is believed to be the oldest building in South Yorkshire: the probably 8th-century [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] St Peter's [[Church (building)|Church]].  The church was enlarged in the twelfth century, and David Hey claims that it was a Minster church, forming the centre of a large, early parish covering all or much of the eleventh century Fee of Conisbrough.<ref name=\"hey\" />\n\n[[Peter Langtoft]], writing in the 13th century, claimed that [[Egbert of Wessex]] had been received at \"Burghe Conane\", which is often identified with Conisbrough.<ref name=\"hey\">David Hey, ''Medieval South Yorkshire''</ref>\n\n===Kilner connection===\n\nIn 1863, the [[Kilner jar|Kilner]] company opened a glass-making plant in Conisbrough.<ref>Grace's Guide. Accessed 4 February 2017 at http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Kilner_Brothers</ref> \"The bottles made at Conisbrough are chiefly mineral water, spice, confectionery, wine and spirits, pickle, medicine, and chemists. and druggists bottles of all descriptions.\" <ref>Messrs. Kilner Brothers Jubilee: 50 Years in the Glass Bottle Trade. Accessed 4 February 2017 from http://conisbroughanddenabyhistory.org.uk/article/kilners-jubilee/</ref> In 1866, Caleb Kilner was sent to manage it, along with his cousin Kilner Bateson.<ref>Death of Caleb Kilner \u2013 Business Genius.

Accessed 4 February 2017 at http://www.brothersfive.ca/sb_kilner_brothers.html</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\n[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] wrote about the town, claiming that it had been fortified by [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], King of the Britons after his victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of [[Hengist]] (Historia Regum Britanniae viii, 7), that the captive Anglo-Saxon leader Hengist was hacked to pieces by [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester|Eldol]] outside the town walls, and was buried at \"Hengist's Mound\" in the town.\n\nIn [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', 'Coningsburgh Castle' is based on Conisbrough.  Scott's Coningsburgh is an Anglo-Saxon fortress, based (perhaps knowingly) on the mistaken conclusion that its unique style marked it as a non-Norman castle.  The great tower is described specifically, so that it is clear that Scott has the Norman version of Conisbrough in mind.\n\n===Earth Centre===\nIn the mid-1990s, a new tourist attraction, [[Earth Centre]], opened on the nearby site of the former Cadeby Main Colliery. It closed in 2005 after it failed to attract the expected number of visitors. A leisure centre has been built on the site of the former Denaby Main Colliery. In the 2008 drama ''Survivors'', the Earth centre was used as the place Abby was shot and taken in.\n\n===Sporting links===\n\nIt has also been a host to the Olympic Torch Relay for the [[2012 London Olympics]]<ref name=\"Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough\">{{Cite web|title = Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough|url = http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/olympic-fever-to-hit-conisbrough-1-4678896|website = www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk|access-date = 13 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough\"/>\n\nYorkshire saw The Grand Depart for the Tour de France <ref>{{Cite web|title = Grand D\u00e9part 2014 - Yorkshire|url = http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2014/us/grand-depart.html|website = Tour de France 2014|access-date = 13 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094009/http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2014/us/grand-depart.html|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> in 2014.

The [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]]'s scheme to turn Northcliffe into an Academy was scrapped after protests by parents, students and staff, despite the enthusiastic backing of former Conisbrough councillor Aidan Rave and former Doncaster Mayor Martin Winter.\n\nPrimary education in Conisbrough is provided by Ivanhoe Academy, Castle Academy also Station Road School as well as Morley Place Juniors, Rowena Infants & Balby Street Primary.\n\nFurther education is now available at the De Warrene Academy (post 2010) however some residents of the village choose to either attend Dearne Valley College or Doncaster College, both a short bus ride from Conisbrough or other colleges further afield such as RCAT, Barnsley college etc.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe town lies at the junction of the A6023 and the [[A630 road|A630]] Doncaster - Rotherham road.

This was formerly the Kwik Save. The land was formerly the petrol station of the Greathead family.\n\nConisbrough had a co-op in the town centre opposite the Sainsburys Store, again used for local conveniences. This closed in September 2016. The site has since been refit and opened as a Go-Local convenience store. The site was originally a cinema.\n\nShopping Facilities:\n\nChemist (Town Centre & Doctors), florist shops, card shop, vape / smokers' store, news agents, butchers, do-it-yourself / hardware stores, estate agency / financial advisors, clothes store, bookmakers, cafe, charity shops and house clearance shop.\n\nOther stores include the Crusty Cob Shop, which has the bakery head office and bake house for their small local chain. The last bank in the town was NatWest, after the closure of Santander's branch in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/closure-will-leave-conisbrough-with-just-one-bank-1-6512595|title=Closure will leave Conisbrough with just one bank|work=South Yorkshire Times|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref> Natwest, a sub branch of its neighbour Mexbrorough closed in November 2015 leaving no bank. However, there are cash machines available 24/7 at the old bank site, Sainsbury and the post office. The Go-Local has a cash machine outside but only available during store hours. There is now a Sub bank where the old Santander was which is now a Yorkshire Building Society.\n\n==Public transport==\n\n===Bus services===\nThe main bus operator in the town is [[Stagecoach Yorkshire]] providing an extensive network of services into Doncaster & throughout the Dearne Valley referred to as \"The Dearne Link\".  Buses run at least every ten minutes into Doncaster & Mexborough and at least half-hourly through to Barnsley, Wath, Cortonwood & Rotherham. [[First South Yorkshire]] also operate a service through Conisbrough running at least every ten minutes throughout the day between Sheffield and Doncaster on its X78 route\n\n===Rail services===\nThe town is served by [[Conisbrough railway station]] and the main operator from the railway station is [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]].

In a will of around 1003, Conisbrough was bequeathed by [[Wulfric Spott]], founder of [[Burton Abbey]].  At this point, it appears to have been the centre of a major former royal estate, reaching [[Hatfield Chase]].  The manor became royal again under [[Harold II of England]], and by the [[Norman Conquest]], 28 townships in what is now South Yorkshire belonged to the Lord of Conisbrough.  [[William the Conqueror]] gave the whole lordship to [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]].<ref name=\"hey\" />\n\nThe name of Conisbrough relates to a king's stronghold and this is usually presumed to have either been on the site of [[Conisbrough Castle]], or of the parish church. At the time of the Norman Conquest the manor of Conisbrough was held by King Harold - he was defeated at the Battle of Hastings. Conisbrough Castle is contained within an artificial oval-shaped enclosure similar to one used as [[wapentake]] meeting-places at [[Gringley-on-the-Hill]] and [[East Markham]], leading Malcolm Dolby to suppose the castle site may have once been the meeting-place of the [[Strafforth and Tickhill]] wapentake.<ref name=\"hey\" />\n[[File:St.Peter's church - geograph.org.uk - 922213.jpg|thumb|left|180px|St Peter's Church, Conisbrough]]\nConisbrough contains what is believed to be the oldest building in South Yorkshire: the probably 8th-century [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] St Peter's [[Church (building)|Church]].  The church was enlarged in the twelfth century, and David Hey claims that it was a Minster church, forming the centre of a large, early parish covering all or much of the eleventh century Fee of Conisbrough.<ref name=\"hey\" />\n\n[[Peter Langtoft]], writing in the 13th century, claimed that [[Egbert of Wessex]] had been received at \"Burghe Conane\", which is often identified with Conisbrough.<ref name=\"hey\">David Hey, ''Medieval South Yorkshire''</ref>\n\n===Kilner connection===\n\nIn 1863, the [[Kilner jar|Kilner]] company opened a glass-making plant in Conisbrough.<ref>Grace's Guide.

Scott's Coningsburgh is an Anglo-Saxon fortress, based (perhaps knowingly) on the mistaken conclusion that its unique style marked it as a non-Norman castle.  The great tower is described specifically, so that it is clear that Scott has the Norman version of Conisbrough in mind.\n\n===Earth Centre===\nIn the mid-1990s, a new tourist attraction, [[Earth Centre]], opened on the nearby site of the former Cadeby Main Colliery. It closed in 2005 after it failed to attract the expected number of visitors. A leisure centre has been built on the site of the former Denaby Main Colliery. In the 2008 drama ''Survivors'', the Earth centre was used as the place Abby was shot and taken in.\n\n===Sporting links===\n\nIt has also been a host to the Olympic Torch Relay for the [[2012 London Olympics]]<ref name=\"Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough\">{{Cite web|title = Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough|url = http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/olympic-fever-to-hit-conisbrough-1-4678896|website = www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk|access-date = 13 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Olympic fever to hit Conisbrough\"/>\n\nYorkshire saw The Grand Depart for the Tour de France <ref>{{Cite web|title = Grand D\u00e9part 2014 - Yorkshire|url = http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2014/us/grand-depart.html|website = Tour de France 2014|access-date = 13 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094009/http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2014/us/grand-depart.html|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> in 2014.

The [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]]'s scheme to turn Northcliffe into an Academy was scrapped after protests by parents, students and staff, despite the enthusiastic backing of former Conisbrough councillor Aidan Rave and former Doncaster Mayor Martin Winter.\n\nPrimary education in Conisbrough is provided by Ivanhoe Academy, Castle Academy also Station Road School as well as Morley Place Juniors, Rowena Infants & Balby Street Primary.\n\nFurther education is now available at the De Warrene Academy (post 2010) however some residents of the village choose to either attend Dearne Valley College or Doncaster College, both a short bus ride from Conisbrough or other colleges further afield such as RCAT, Barnsley college etc.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe town lies at the junction of the A6023 and the [[A630 road|A630]] Doncaster - Rotherham road.

The plain-aspirated distinction is neutralized and realized with aspiration or voiceless release in syllable-final position and before another consonant. Plain stops are voiced before a short vowel or after an aspirated stop, voiceless elsewhere.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\">Nevin 1998.</ref>\n\nIn a 5-vowel system, consisting of 5  short and long, /\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0259 \u028a/ and /i e a o u/, the mid vowels may be of secondary origin historically, as in [[Yana language|Yana]] and [[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]]. A schwa [\u0259] appears epenthetically between the consonants of certain prefixes, as in ''lh\u00fapta'' \"let's go!\". Two degrees of length are contrastive for both vowels and consonants. In downriver dialects, the second [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of a long vowel is devoiced before a plain or aspirated consonant ([[preaspiration]]) and laryngealized before a laryngealized consonant. Long vowels are typically more peripheral and short vowels more centralized. In downriver dialects, utterance-final syllables may be devoiced or whispered.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/>\n\nUnlike the neighboring and related language [[Atsugewi]], Achumawi has distinctive tone on every syllable.<ref name=\"Nevin 1998\"/><ref name=\"mithun2001\">{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Morphology ==\n\nThe Achumawi language does not have gender nor a sense of [[plural]]ity expressed as nouns.

He sings like he has a point to prove throughout The Burning. A telling sign of the frontman's burgeoning confidence comes on \"Elysium\" \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he's communing with lost souls on \"Lightning\" or offering a consolatory ear on closer \"Native Son\", he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\"<ref>{{Citation|title=The Burning (British Lion album)|date=2020-04-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Burning_(British_Lion_album)&oldid=951473989|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nMetal Temple deemed the album a 9/10 saying \u201cThe Burning\u201d is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. Hawkins and Leslie's dual guitar attack is on point, Dawson's drums precise and well deftly executed. Taylor's vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal. British Lion's \"The Burning\" is refreshing in its telling of the story, and hints of even better tales in the future.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Burning (British Lion album)|date=2020-04-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Burning_(British_Lion_album)&oldid=951473989|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"The Burning sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that British Lion have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and Harris's love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of \"Bible Black\" sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Citation|title=The Burning (British Lion album)|date=2020-04-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Burning_(British_Lion_album)&oldid=951473989|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nCryptic Rock said British Lion are one of the more interesting and intriguing side projects in [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] today.

luxury item that they would take to an imaginary desert island, where they will be marooned indefinitely. The rules state that the chosen luxury item must not be anything animate or indeed anything that enables the castaway to escape from the island, for instance a radio set, sailing yacht or aeroplane.

She continued to star in her husband's shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1968 appeared in the sitcom ''[[B-And-B]]'', along with her husband and daughter.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Kelly appeared in a few films including ''[[The Desert Hawk (1950 film)|The Desert Hawk]]'', ''[[A Tale of Five Cities]]'', ''[[Castle in the Air (film)|Castle in the Air]]'', and ''[[Love in Pawn]]''. She may have been best known for her frequent appearances as a panelist on the television show ''[[What's My Line#United Kingdom|What's My Line?]]'' (1951\u201363), transmitted by the [[BBC]] on Sunday evenings, which was very popular, although, as Kelly reflected in later years, it had no competition: \"it was the only programme on the air!\"<ref name=\"The Oldie\">{{cite news|url=|title=Still With Us: Barbara Kelly|first=Alice|last=Pitman|publisher=[[The Oldie]]|date=May 2001}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1964 to 1967, she introduced ''[[Criss Cross Quiz]]'', a general knowledge game based on [[Tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]].

In 1983 she took part in a revival of ''What's My Line?''

The introduction of the [[English language]] during the [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American occupation of the Philippines]], elicited confusion as the English word \"[[bay]]\", referring to another body of water, was mistakenly substituted to the town name that led to its mispronunciation.<ref name=\"feleosheniak\"/> However, the word \"Bay\" in Laguna de Bay has always referred to the town.<ref name=\"odaluniliever\">{{Citation\n | last=Odal-Devora\n | first=Grace P.\n | date=\n | year=\n | contribution='Bae' or 'Bai': The Lady of the Lake\n | contribution-url=\n | editor-last=Alejandro\n | editor-first=Reynaldo Gamboa\n | title= Laguna de Bay: The Living Lake\n | edition=\n | place=\n | publisher=Unilever Philippines\n | publication-date=2002\n | volume=\n | pages=\n | id=\n | url=\n | isbn=971-922-721-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''Laguna'' refers to not just [[lagoon]]s but also for freshwater [[lake]]s, aside from ''lago''.<ref>[http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/laguna \"Laguna\"].

In 1993, by virtue of the devolution, the administrative supervision of the LLDA was transferred to the DENR by EO 149.<ref>LLDA 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nGovernment data showed that about 60% of the estimated 8.4&nbsp;million people residing in the Laguna de Bay Region discharge their solid and liquid wastes indirectly to the lake through its tributaries. A large percentage of these wastes are mainly agricultural while the rest are either domestic or industrial<ref>[[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR]], 1997</ref> According to [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR]] (1997), domestic and industrial wastes contribute almost equally at 30% each. Meanwhile, agricultural wastes take up the remaining 40%. In a recent sensitivity waste load model ran by the Laguna Lake Development Authority's (LLDA) Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) division, it revealed that 70% of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) loadings came from households, 19% from industries, and 11% came from land run-off or erosion (LLDA, 2005).\n\nAs far as industries and factories are concerned, there are about 1,481 and increase is expected.<ref name=Guerrero1998 /> Of the said figure, about 695 have wastewater treatment facilities. Despite this, the lake is absorbing huge amounts of pollution from these industries in the forms of discharges of industrial cooling water, toxic spills from barges and transport operations, and hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, aluminum and cyanide.<ref>Sly, 1984</ref> Based from the said figure, 65% are classified as \u201cpollutive\u201d industries.\n\nThe hastened agricultural modernization throughout the region took its toll on the lake. This paved the way for massive and intensified use of chemical based fertilizers and pesticides whose residues eventually find their way to the lake basin. These chemicals induce rapid algal growth in the area that depleted oxygen levels in the water. Hence, [[oxygen]] available to the lake is being used up thereby depleting the available oxygen for the fish, causing massive [[fish kills]].<ref name=SPP1992>Solidarity for People\u2019s Power (1992) Laguna de bay: Racing against time.

In 1993, by virtue of the devolution, the administrative supervision of the LLDA was transferred to the DENR by EO 149.<ref>LLDA 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nGovernment data showed that about 60% of the estimated 8.4&nbsp;million people residing in the Laguna de Bay Region discharge their solid and liquid wastes indirectly to the lake through its tributaries. A large percentage of these wastes are mainly agricultural while the rest are either domestic or industrial<ref>[[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR]], 1997</ref> According to [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR]] (1997), domestic and industrial wastes contribute almost equally at 30% each. Meanwhile, agricultural wastes take up the remaining 40%. In a recent sensitivity waste load model ran by the Laguna Lake Development Authority's (LLDA) Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) division, it revealed that 70% of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) loadings came from households, 19% from industries, and 11% came from land run-off or erosion (LLDA, 2005).\n\nAs far as industries and factories are concerned, there are about 1,481 and increase is expected.<ref name=Guerrero1998 /> Of the said figure, about 695 have wastewater treatment facilities. Despite this, the lake is absorbing huge amounts of pollution from these industries in the forms of discharges of industrial cooling water, toxic spills from barges and transport operations, and hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, aluminum and cyanide.<ref>Sly, 1984</ref> Based from the said figure, 65% are classified as \u201cpollutive\u201d industries.\n\nThe hastened agricultural modernization throughout the region took its toll on the lake. This paved the way for massive and intensified use of chemical based fertilizers and pesticides whose residues eventually find their way to the lake basin. These chemicals induce rapid algal growth in the area that depleted oxygen levels in the water. Hence, [[oxygen]] available to the lake is being used up thereby depleting the available oxygen for the fish, causing massive [[fish kills]].<ref name=SPP1992>Solidarity for People\u2019s Power (1992) Laguna de bay: Racing against time.

As reported by the now defunct Metropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), only 15% of the residents in the area have an effective waste disposal system. Moreover, around 85% of the families living along the shoreline do not have toilets and/or septic tanks.<ref name=Batu1996 /><ref name=SPP1992 />\n\nOn January 29, 2008, the Mamamayan Para sa Pagpapanatili ng Pagpapaunlad ng Lawa ng Laguna (Mapagpala) accused the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) of the deterioration of Laguna de Bay due to multiplication of fish pens beyond the allowable limit.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=41445\n |title        = Group blames LLDA for Laguna Lake\u2019s deterioration\n |publisher    = philstar.com\n |accessdate   = 2012-10-03\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160602060446/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=41445\n |archive-date = 2016-06-02\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike==\n{{Main article|Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike}}\n[[File:Typhoon Ketsana aftermath near Laguna Lake1.jpg|right|thumb|People of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay/Bae]] in the Laguna de Bay area, south of Manila, were affected in the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana.

The system shall be established on the basis of payment to the government for discharging wastewater into the water bodies. Wastewater charges shall be established taking into consideration the following: a) to provide strong economic inducement for polluters to modify their production or management processes or to invest in pollution control technology in order to reduce the amount of water pollutants generated; b) to cover the cost of administering water quality management or improvement programs, including the cost of administering the discharge permitting and water pollution charge system; c) reflect damages caused by water pollution on the surrounding environment, including the cost of rehabilitation; d) type of pollutant; e) classification of the receiving water body; and f) other special attributes of the water body.<ref>Department of Environment and Natural Resources (2005).
