Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F.

The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G. Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}} The CFA was by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion, though she recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} The CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medallist.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, stating she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of  [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight.

He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45.

He designed and produced instruments for [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] in the 1970s through his company CLF Research. When relations with Music Man soured, G&L was created to continue operations apart from Music Man. The G&L name comes from two founders' first names, George Fullerton and Leo Fender.{{sfn| Fullerton | 2005 |p=53}}\n\nG&L instruments are similar to the classic Fenders, but with some modern innovations. They are built at the same facility on Fender Avenue in [[Fullerton, California]] that produced the early Music Man instruments. G&L instruments are not widely distributed but are highly regarded by many musicians and collectors. The relatively small scale of production further allows for more custom options that are not possible on larger production lines.\n\nAfter the death of Leo Fender in 1991, Fender's wife, Phyllis Fender, passed the management of G&L to John C.

MFDs are known for their distinctive tone, which combines clarity, high fidelity and power with an airy \"sweetness\".\n* The \"Dual-Fulcrum Vibrato\" {{sfn| Fullerton | 2005 |p=152}} has two pivot points. The design aims to improve tuning stability, and according to some has a sound that is more mellow than a traditional bridge. It allows the player to bend notes up as well as down. See also [[Tremolo arm]].\n* The G&L \"Saddle-Lock bridge\" {{sfn| Fullerton | 2005 |p=152}} utilizes a small Allen screw on the side of the bridge, to reduce side-to-side movement of the individual string saddles. The design, and the bridge's beefy dimensions, aim to prevent loss of sustain due to this sideways motion by locking the saddles together.\n* The \"Tilt Neck Mechanism\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/features/artists/details.asp?AID=3543 |title=George Fullerton Guitar Icon (1923-2009) |access-date=2010-03-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309151128/http://www.vintageguitar.com/features/artists/details.asp?AID=3543 |archive-date=2010-03-09 |df= }}</ref> designed and patented by George Fullerton. This feature is no longer used, and was a carryover from Music Man production.\n* The \"Bi-cut neck design\" {{sfn| Fullerton | 2005 |p=153}} involved cutting the neck lengthwise perpendicular to where the fretboard is later installed, routing a channel for the [[truss rod]], then gluing the two neck pieces back together.

A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found. When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by a firing squad of soldiers.

Because Bishop was a widely popular leader, he was freed by impassioned supporters who marched en masse on his guarded residence from a rally in the capital's central square.

A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found. When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by a firing squad of soldiers.

He began playing at a young age with Endeavour Hills and the Narre Warren Junior Football Club and attended [[De La Salle College, Malvern]].\n\nHe was scouted by recruiters and as an 18-year-old and nominated for the 1997 [[AFL Draft]]. Croad was invited to the AFL Draft camp where he set the draft camp record for a standing vertical jump at 83&nbsp;cm, which remains a decade later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/afl/testing-draft-results.htm|title=AFL Draft Combine Testing Results|website=Topendsports.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== AFL career ==\n===Hawthorn===\nHawthorn picked up Croad with the third overall selection in the draft. He started out as a defender, playing at either [[centre half-back]] or [[fullback (Australian rules football)|fullback]]. But he showed his versatility as his career went on, being able to play in any number of [[key position]]s.\n\n===Fremantle===\nCroad was traded from Hawthorn to Fremantle at the end of 2001. The picks given up by Fremantle were used by Hawthorn to select former Hawthorn stars [[Luke Hodge]] and [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]], whilst [[Luke McPharlin]] joined Croad in moving west. While Croad was reasonable but not spectacular at the Dockers, in 2002, he was Fremantle's leading goalkicker with 42 goals. The following season Croad lost confidence and kicked 18 goals. He cited homesickness and asked to be traded back to Victoria at the end of 2003.\n\n=== Return to Hawthorn  ===\nHe was traded back to Hawthorn, this time only in return for pick 10, which was used by Fremantle to select [[Ryley Dunn]]. Croad was told that he would be the centre half back, with a regular position his form improved once he went back to the Hawks, winning [[All-Australian]] selection in 2005.\n\nCroad relished the responsibility of being the senior man down back being strong, athletic type who took the oppositions best forward each week. During the second quarter of the [[AFL Grand Final|2008 Grand Final]], Croad broke his left foot, and leaving the ground with the aid of trainers he still managed to lay a bump on Geelong's [[Joel Selwood]] before playing no further part in the game. Hawthorn went on to win the match and Croad earned his first premiership medallion in over 200 games of AFL football.\n\nCroad missed the entire 2009 season due to his 2008 Grand Final injury, and on the 6th of January 2010 he announced his retirement after his surgeon warned him that he might permanently lose all function in his left foot if he broke it again.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mighty Fighting Hawks|author=Martin Blake|date=March 28, 2016|publisher=Penguin Books|ISBN=9781760142629|page=45}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn October 2006, Croad married Tanya Stewart, and had two daughters, Kiera (born July 2007) and Sierra (born October 2009).

He began playing at a young age with Endeavour Hills and the Narre Warren Junior Football Club and attended [[De La Salle College, Malvern]].\n\nHe was scouted by recruiters and as an 18-year-old and nominated for the 1997 [[AFL Draft]]. Croad was invited to the AFL Draft camp where he set the draft camp record for a standing vertical jump at 83&nbsp;cm, which remains a decade later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/afl/testing-draft-results.htm|title=AFL Draft Combine Testing Results|website=Topendsports.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== AFL career ==\n===Hawthorn===\nHawthorn picked up Croad with the third overall selection in the draft. He started out as a defender, playing at either [[centre half-back]] or [[fullback (Australian rules football)|fullback]]. But he showed his versatility as his career went on, being able to play in any number of [[key position]]s.\n\n===Fremantle===\nCroad was traded from Hawthorn to Fremantle at the end of 2001. The picks given up by Fremantle were used by Hawthorn to select former Hawthorn stars [[Luke Hodge]] and [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]], whilst [[Luke McPharlin]] joined Croad in moving west. While Croad was reasonable but not spectacular at the Dockers, in 2002, he was Fremantle's leading goalkicker with 42 goals. The following season Croad lost confidence and kicked 18 goals. He cited homesickness and asked to be traded back to Victoria at the end of 2003.\n\n=== Return to Hawthorn  ===\nHe was traded back to Hawthorn, this time only in return for pick 10, which was used by Fremantle to select [[Ryley Dunn]]. Croad was told that he would be the centre half back, with a regular position his form improved once he went back to the Hawks, winning [[All-Australian]] selection in 2005.\n\nCroad relished the responsibility of being the senior man down back being strong, athletic type who took the oppositions best forward each week. During the second quarter of the [[AFL Grand Final|2008 Grand Final]], Croad broke his left foot, and leaving the ground with the aid of trainers he still managed to lay a bump on Geelong's [[Joel Selwood]] before playing no further part in the game. Hawthorn went on to win the match and Croad earned his first premiership medallion in over 200 games of AFL football.\n\nCroad missed the entire 2009 season due to his 2008 Grand Final injury, and on the 6th of January 2010 he announced his retirement after his surgeon warned him that he might permanently lose all function in his left foot if he broke it again.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mighty Fighting Hawks|author=Martin Blake|date=March 28, 2016|publisher=Penguin Books|ISBN=9781760142629|page=45}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn October 2006, Croad married Tanya Stewart, and had two daughters, Kiera (born July 2007) and Sierra (born October 2009).

The High Court\u2019s decision reveals that, from the start, there were two sides to this story \u2014 a flawed church that Pell represented and a flawed Victorian legal system prejudiced against him.

This is polite judicial language. Let\u2019s call it for what it was: a sentiment in parts of the community that Pell\u2019s trial had a meaning transcending guilt or innocence \u2014 that he must be punished for the church\u2019s crimes in the name of its hundreds of victims. This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

The High Court\u2019s decision reveals that, from the start, there were two sides to this story \u2014 a flawed church that Pell represented and a flawed Victorian legal system prejudiced against him.

This is polite judicial language. Let\u2019s call it for what it was: a sentiment in parts of the community that Pell\u2019s trial had a meaning transcending guilt or innocence \u2014 that he must be punished for the church\u2019s crimes in the name of its hundreds of victims. This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

Its wireless [[Joy-Con]] controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support [[Handheld game console|handheld]]-style play. They can also connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console [[gamepad]] form, or be used individually in the hand like the [[Wii Remote|Wii Remote and Nunchuk]], supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports [[online game|online gaming]] through Internet connectivity, as well as local [[Wireless ad hoc network|wireless ad hoc]] connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical [[flash storage|flash]]-based [[Nintendo game card|ROM cartridges]] and [[digital distribution]] via [[Nintendo eShop]]; the system has no [[Regional lockout|region lockout]]. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the [[Nintendo Switch Lite]], was released on September 20, 2019. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename '''NX''', the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the [[Wii U]], and market competition from [[mobile gaming]]. Nintendo's then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on [[Nvidia]]'s [[Tegra]] line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing [[game engine]]s. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party developers and publishers]] to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many [[independent video game]] studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\n\nAs an [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation]] console, the Nintendo Switch competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]]. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. {{As of|2019|December}}, the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have sold more than 52 million units worldwide.

that some broad concepts of the Switch extend from the \"lateral thinking with seasoned technology\" design philosophy of [[Gunpei Yokoi]] that Nintendo has used over the last couple of decades.<ref

that are aimed to be played \"deeply\", according to Shinya Takahashi and [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]], general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development|Entertainment Planning & Development Division]] (EPD), respectively.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players; Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups, while Western players tend to play at home by themselves.<ref name=\"time feb2017\"/> The design of the Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like ''[[1-2-Switch]]'', could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture.<ref name=\"time kimishima\"/> Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play both on a television screen and as a portable, and the use of detachable controllers.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> The \"Switch\" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present \"the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives\".<ref name=\"siliconera naming\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2016/12/07/nintendo-explains-switch-got-name-goal-reveal-trailer/ |

With the release of games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'' and ''[[Wii Fit]]'', players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314530/The_Nintendo_Switch_JoyCons_and_even_Labo_are_the_result_of_Wiiera_feedback.php | title = The Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons, and even Labo are the result of Wii-era feedback | first = Alissa | last= McAloon | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | website = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Other concepts came out of consumer feedback that was critical of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the [[Wii U GamePad]] and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | title = Nintendo president: \"I compete for time,\" not against Xbox, PlayStation | first = Sam | last= Mackovech  |date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 8, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/>\n\nIn addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's [[central processing unit]] with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing [[system on a chip]] (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\"<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | title = The Switch's Architect On Why Nintendo's Consoles Are Different | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = February 26, 2017 | accessdate = March 1, 2017 | website = [[Game Informer]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170301082232/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | archivedate = March 1, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nKoizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during development.<ref name=\"time feb2017\"/> According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\".<ref name=\"glixel miyamoto\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | title = Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto Didn't Lead Switch Development | first = John | last = Davidson | date = January 12, 2017 | accessdate = January 12, 2017 | website = [[Glixel]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170747/http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | archivedate = January 13, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes dec 2017\"/> Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans.

Its wireless [[Joy-Con]] controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support [[Handheld game console|handheld]]-style play. They can also connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console [[gamepad]] form, or be used individually in the hand like the [[Wii Remote|Wii Remote and Nunchuk]], supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports [[online game|online gaming]] through Internet connectivity, as well as local [[Wireless ad hoc network|wireless ad hoc]] connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical [[flash storage|flash]]-based [[Nintendo game card|ROM cartridges]] and [[digital distribution]] via [[Nintendo eShop]]; the system has no [[Regional lockout|region lockout]]. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the [[Nintendo Switch Lite]], was released on September 20, 2019. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename '''NX''', the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the [[Wii U]], and market competition from [[mobile gaming]]. Nintendo's then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on [[Nvidia]]'s [[Tegra]] line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing [[game engine]]s. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party developers and publishers]] to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many [[independent video game]] studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\n\nAs an [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation]] console, the Nintendo Switch competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]]. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. {{As of|2019|December}}, the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have sold more than 52 million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']] having sold over ten million units each.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nNintendo had seen record revenues, net sales and profits in 2009 as a result of the release of the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006 and 2004 respectively,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/nintendo-defies-recession-with-record-profits-20090507-awdo.html|title=Nintendo defies recession with record profits|date=May 7, 2009|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/21/official-nintendo-ds-launch-details|title=Official Nintendo DS Launch Details|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=September 20, 2004|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2009 Annual Financial\">{{Cite report|publisher=Nintendo|year=2009|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=2009 Annual Financial Report: Financial Section|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/annual0903e.pdf|page=17}}</ref> but in Nintendo's subsequent years, its revenues had declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/17/nintendo-chief-we-failed/|title=Nintendo Chief: 'We Failed'|last=Nicks|first=Denver|date=January 17, 2014|work=Time|access-date=March 1, 2019|language=en|issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3850264/nintendo-sales-wii-u-3ds-universal-studios/|title=Why Nintendo is Suddenly Profitable Again|last=Luckerson|first=Victor|date=May 7, 2015|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref> The company had posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the [[Wii U]]'s introduction that year, and had similar losses in the following years due to the console's poor uptake.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/technology/nintendos-wii-u-takes-aim-at-a-changed-video-game-world.html|title=Nintendo's Wii U Takes Aim at a Changed Video Game World|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|access-date=November 21, 2018|language=en}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against [[mobile gaming]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | title = Resisting Mobile Hurts Nintendo's Bottom Line | first = Nick | last = Wingfield | date = January 18, 2014 | accessdate = December 9, 2016 | website = [[New York Times]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170728200642/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | archivedate = July 28, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Previously, the company had been hesitant about this market, with then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] considering that they would \"cease to be Nintendo\" and lose their identity if they attempted to enter it.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=Nintendo + Smartphones?

Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like ''[[1-2-Switch]]'', could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture.<ref name=\"time kimishima\"/> Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play both on a television screen and as a portable, and the use of detachable controllers.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> The \"Switch\" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present \"the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way

With the release of games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'' and ''[[Wii Fit]]'', players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314530/The_Nintendo_Switch_JoyCons_and_even_Labo_are_the_result_of_Wiiera_feedback.php | title = The Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons, and even Labo are the result of Wii-era feedback | first = Alissa | last= McAloon | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | website = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Other concepts came out of consumer feedback that was critical of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the [[Wii U GamePad]] and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | title = Nintendo president: \"I compete for time,\" not against Xbox, PlayStation | first = Sam | last= Mackovech  |date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 8, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/>\n\nIn addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's [[central processing unit]] with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing [[system on a chip]] (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\"<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | title = The Switch's Architect On Why Nintendo's Consoles Are Different | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = February 26, 2017 | accessdate = March 1, 2017 | website = [[Game Informer]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170301082232/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | archivedate = March 1, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nKoizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during development.<ref name=\"time feb2017\"/> According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\".<ref name=\"glixel miyamoto\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | title = Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto Didn't Lead Switch Development | first = John | last = Davidson | date = January 12, 2017 | accessdate = January 12, 2017 | website = [[Glixel]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170747/http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | archivedate = January 13, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes dec 2017\"/> Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans.
