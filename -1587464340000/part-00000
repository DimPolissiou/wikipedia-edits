Arcade Arakaza later said: -''It was a classic envelope trap, with the Shabab drawing the peacekeepers deeper into their lair, sealing off the escape routes and then closing in from all sides.''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/world/africa/africa-forces-surprise-many-with-success-in-subduing-somalia.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|title=African Union Force Makes Strides Inside Somalia|work=The New York Times|date=24 November 2011|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman}}</ref> AMISOM managed to fight back and capture the Daynile police station.

The show debuted on October 5, 2000, on [[The WB]] and became a flagship series for the network. ''Gilmore Girls'' originally ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to [[The CW]] and ending its run on May 15, 2007.\n\nThe show's main focus is on the relationship between single mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], who live in [[Stars Hollow]], [[Connecticut]], a small fictional town filled with colorful characters. The series explores issues of family, romance, education, friendship, disappointment, and ambition, along with generational divides and social class, the latter themes manifesting through Lorelai's difficult relationship with her [[High society (social class)|high society]] parents, [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], and Rory's experiences at the elite, private high school Chilton and later on at [[Yale University]].\nSherman-Palladino, who served as [[showrunner]] for the majority of the series, infused ''Gilmore Girls'' with distinctive fast-paced dialogue filled with [[pop culture]] references. After season six, when the series moved to its new network, Sherman-Palladino left the show and was replaced by [[David S. Rosenthal]] for the final season. The series was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and filmed on the studio's lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\nTelevision critics praised ''Gilmore Girls'' for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It never drew large ratings but was a relative success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second most-popular show. The series has been in daily [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 2004, while a growing and dedicated [[fandom]] has led to its status as a cult classic. Since coming off the air, ''Gilmore Girls'' has been cited in ''[[TV (The Book)]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=tvbook/><ref name=\"The Making of The Gilmore Girls\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html |title=All-TIME 100 TV Shows |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 2016, the main cast and Sherman-Palladino returned for a four-part [[miniseries]] revival titled ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life]]'', which streamed on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Premise ==\n\nThe series has two protagonists: witty \"thirty-something\" mother [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and her intellectual teenage daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] (short for Lorelai). Their backstory is established early in the show: Lorelai grew up in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] with her [[old money]] parents, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Emily Gilmore|Emily]], but always felt stifled in this environment. After Lorelai and her childhood friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Christopher Hayden]] became pregnant with Rory at 16, Lorelai's feelings of familial alienation only increased. This eventually motivated her to take one-year-old Rory away to a close-knit town named [[Stars Hollow]]. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn as a maid, eventually working her way up to the executive management. Over the years, Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends rather than as typical mother-daughter. Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has forged away from her parents. In the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]], however, she is forced to go to them for financial aid after Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School because she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, so long as the girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up one of the show's primary, ongoing conflicts: the Gilmore family is forced to face their differences and complicated past. The contrasting mother-daughter relationships of Emily\u2013Lorelai and Lorelai\u2013Rory become a defining theme of the show and a lens through which many of the female relationships are viewed. Series creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] has summarized the core of ''Gilmore Girls'':\n\n{{quote|I think the theme was always family and connection. I always felt like the underlying thing about Gilmore was that, if you happened to be born into a family that doesn't really understand you, go out and make your own. That's what Lorelai did. She went out and she made her own family. The ironic twist in her life is that then this daughter that she created this half family for, likes the family that she left. It was a cycle of crazy family.<ref name=collider/>}}\n\nThe series also focuses on both girls' ambition: Rory to attend an [[Ivy League]] college and become a journalist, and Lorelai to open an inn with her best friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Sookie St. James|Sookie St. James]]. The romantic relationships of the protagonists are another key feature; throughout the series, Lorelai has a \"will-they-won't-they\" dynamic with her friend, local diner owner [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Luke Danes|Luke Danes]], while also harboring unresolved feelings for Rory's father, Christopher. Lorelai also develops temporary feelings for Rory's English literature teacher, Max Medina, and Jason \"Digger\" Stiles, who she has known since childhood. Rory's romantic journey throughout the show is based on the adolescent experiences of first-loves, flings, crushes, and college dates. While Rory has three committed boyfriends over the course of the show \u2013 local new-kid [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Dean Forrester|Dean Forrester]]; mysterious, well-read bad boy [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Jess Mariano|Jess Mariano]]; and wealthy, charismatic [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Logan Huntzberger|Logan Huntzberger]]\u2014she also has brief, romantically charged relationships with men whose love is unrequited: fellow Chilton student [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Tristan Dugray]] and Rory's only \"guy-bestie\" at Yale, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Marty]].\n\nThe quirky townspeople of Stars Hollow are a constant presence. Along with series-long and season-long arcs, ''Gilmore Girls'' is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode \u2013 such as town festivals, issues at Lorelai's inn, or school projects of Rory's.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 1)}}\n\nRory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate [[Paris Geller]], her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his, \"I love you\". She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has little interest in his advances. After being romantically pursued by Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory.  At the same time, Lorelai harbours a close friendship with the local diner owner, Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction\u2014but Lorelai is in denial and Luke doesn't act on it. Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 2)}}\n\nLorelai accepts Max's proposal, but realises shortly before the wedding that it doesn't feel right and they break up. She and Sookie get excited about opening their own business at the dilapidated Dragonfly Inn but the owner refuses to sell. Sookie gets engaged to Jackson Belleville, a local farmer. Luke's teenage nephew, Jess Mariano, comes to live under his care. Jess is sullen and angry with everyone apart from Rory. The two strike up a friendship, causing jealousy in Dean. Lorelai is disapproving of their closeness, labeling Jess as a bad influence, especially when they are in a car accident which leads to a blow-up with Luke. Richard announces that he has retired but soon becomes bored and sets up his own insurance company. Christopher appears to have his life together and Lorelai decides to reunite with him. But at Sookie's wedding Christopher learns that his recently estranged fianc\u00e9e is pregnant and decides to return to her, leaving Lorelai heartbroken. Meanwhile, Rory impulsively kisses Jess.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 3)}}\n\nRory's attraction to Jess grows stronger, and she gets jealous when he teases her with a new girlfriend. Dean can't ignore what is going on, and eventually ends their relationship. Rory and Jess immediately become a couple. Meanwhile, she and Paris spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to [[Harvard University]]. Paris is devastated when she doesn't get in. Rory is accepted but decides to attend [[Yale University]] instead, much to Emily and Richard's delight. The Independence Inn is badly damaged in a fire, but Lorelai and Sookie are able to buy the Dragonfly when its elderly owner dies. Jess pressures Rory to have sex with him, which leads to a fight between Dean and Jess. Luke begins dating a lawyer named Nicole. Lane Kim, Rory's best friend, starts a band called Hep Alien and tries to convince her strict mother to let her date the guitarist, Dave, while keeping the band secret. As the season ends, Jess abruptly leaves Stars Hollow to track down his estranged father in California, and Rory graduates High School as [[valedictorian]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 4)}}\n\nRory starts her college education at Yale, with Paris \u2013 now a friend \u2013 as her roommate. Both start working for the [[Yale Daily News]]. Rory is surprised when Dean quickly marries his new girlfriend. The pair grow closer again over the season, leading Rory to turn down Jess when he returns and declares his love. Lorelai spends the season renovating the Dragonfly Inn in preparation for its opening, along with Sookie and their colleague Michel. She also begins a relationship with Richard's new business partner, Jason Stiles, which she keeps secret from her parents. Lane's mother learns about Hep Alien and throws her out of the house. Sookie and Jackson have a son. Lorelai and Jason break up after Jason sues Richard for leaving their partnership and Lorelai sides with her father. Emily feels neglected by Richard and the two separate, with Richard moving into the pool house. Luke and Nicole [[elope]] during a cruise, but quickly decide to divorce. Towards the end of the season, Luke accepts that he is in love with Lorelai and begins wooing her. The pair finally kiss on the Dragonfly's opening night, while Rory loses her virginity to a married Dean.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 5)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke start a relationship. Emily and Richard \u2013 who reunite and renew their wedding vows \u2013 disapprove and Emily interferes by telling Christopher to try to win her back. Luke feels overwhelmed, resulting in a brief separation between him and Lorelai and a rift between Lorelai and Emily. Rory tries to have another relationship with Dean, now separated from his wife after she found out about the affair, but it soon ends when he realizes how different their lives are. She falls for Logan Huntzberger, a wealthy playboy Yale student whose parents think she is beneath him. Lane and Paris both start relationships: the former with her bandmate Zack, the latter with Yale Daily News editor Doyle. Sookie has a daughter. Rory gets an internship at Logan's father's newspaper but is deflated when he tells her she \"doesn't have it.\" Rory lashes out due to this and she and Logan are arrested for stealing a yacht, after which Rory announces that she is quitting Yale and moves in with her grandparents at their pool house. When Lorelai sees how supportive Luke is over the situation, she asks him to marry her.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 6)}}\n\nLorelai is devastated by Rory's actions but insists that she can't force her back to Yale: it's a decision Rory must make for herself. Mother and daughter don't speak for six months. Rory has to complete [[community service]] and Emily gets her a job with the [[Daughters of the American Revolution|DAR]]. Richard becomes concerned but eventually, after encouragement from Jess, Rory returns to Yale and reunites with Lorelai. She replaces Paris as editor of the Yale Daily News, which causes issues in their friendship, and after a short separation from Logan the relationship gets serious. Rory is crushed when Logan's father sends him to work in London. Hep Alien disband then come back together; Lane and Zack get married. Lorelai plans a wedding with Luke, but things get difficult when Luke learns that he has a 12-year-old daughter named April. He starts building a relationship with her but keeps Lorelai separate. Lorelai tries to accept this but eventually snaps and issues him an ultimatum. When he doesn't agree to elope, Lorelai goes to Christopher for comfort.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 7)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke officially split when she tells him she slept with Christopher. Before much time has passed, Christopher convinces Lorelai to try a relationship. The pair spontaneously marry during a trip in Paris, but Lorelai soon accepts that it isn't right and they split amicably. Luke has a custody battle over April, after her mother moves them to New Mexico, and wins the right to see her during holidays. Lane and Zack have twins, and Sookie becomes pregnant again. Rory completes her final year of college. She and Logan spend half the season in a long-distance relationship until he eventually moves back to New York. He proposes, but Rory says that she wants to keep her options open, which leads to their separation. She panics about what she will do after graduating; following some rejection, she gets a job reporting on the [[Barack Obama]] campaign trail. Stars Hollow throws a surprise goodbye party for Rory. When Lorelai finds out that Luke organized it, the pair reconcile with a kiss. Lorelai promises Emily that she will continue attending Friday Night Dinners. Before Lorelai and Rory have to say goodbye, they have one last breakfast at Luke's Diner.\n\n=== ''A Year in the Life'' ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life}}\n\nNine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a ''Gilmore Girls'' revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married the two of them can't seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany: she fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke.

In 2002, four [[young adult novel]]s were published that adapted scripts from the first and second seasons into novel form, told from Rory's [[first-person point of view]].

The show debuted on October 5, 2000, on [[The WB]] and became a flagship series for the network. ''Gilmore Girls'' originally ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to [[The CW]] and ending its run on May 15, 2007.\n\nThe show's main focus is on the relationship between single mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], who live in [[Stars Hollow]], [[Connecticut]], a small fictional town filled with colorful characters. The series explores issues of family, romance, education, friendship, disappointment, and ambition, along with generational divides and social class, the latter themes manifesting through Lorelai's difficult relationship with her [[High society (social class)|high society]] parents, [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], and Rory's experiences at the elite, private high school Chilton and later on at [[Yale University]].\nSherman-Palladino, who served as [[showrunner]] for the majority of the series, infused ''Gilmore Girls'' with distinctive fast-paced dialogue filled with [[pop culture]] references. After season six, when the series moved to its new network, Sherman-Palladino left the show and was replaced by [[David S. Rosenthal]] for the final season. The series was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and filmed on the studio's lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\nTelevision critics praised ''Gilmore Girls'' for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It never drew large ratings but was a relative success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second most-popular show. The series has been in daily [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 2004, while a growing and dedicated [[fandom]] has led to its status as a cult classic. Since coming off the air, ''Gilmore Girls'' has been cited in ''[[TV (The Book)]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=tvbook/><ref name=\"The Making of The Gilmore Girls\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html |title=All-TIME 100 TV Shows |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 2016, the main cast and Sherman-Palladino returned for a four-part [[miniseries]] revival titled ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life]]'', which streamed on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Premise ==\n\nThe series has two protagonists: witty \"thirty-something\" mother [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and her intellectual teenage daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] (short for Lorelai). Their backstory is established early in the show: Lorelai grew up in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] with her [[old money]] parents, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Emily Gilmore|Emily]], but always felt stifled in this environment. After Lorelai and her childhood friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Christopher Hayden]] became pregnant with Rory at 16, Lorelai's feelings of familial alienation only increased. This eventually motivated her to take one-year-old Rory away to a close-knit town named [[Stars Hollow]]. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn as a maid, eventually working her way up to executive manager. Over the years, Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends rather than as typical mother-daughter. Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has forged away from her parents. In the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]], however, she is forced to go to them for financial aid after Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School because she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, so long as the girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up one of the show's primary, ongoing conflicts: the Gilmore family is forced to face their differences and complicated past. The contrasting mother\u2013daughter relationships of Emily\u2013Lorelai and Lorelai\u2013Rory become a defining theme of the show and a lens through which many of the female relationships are viewed. Series creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] has summarized the core of ''Gilmore Girls'':\n\n{{quote|I think the theme was always family and connection. I always felt like the underlying thing about Gilmore was that, if you happened to be born into a family that doesn't really understand you, go out and make your own. That's what Lorelai did. She went out and she made her own family. The ironic twist in her life is that then this daughter that she created this half family for, likes the family that she left. It was a cycle of crazy family.<ref name=collider/>}}\n\nThe series also focuses on both girls' ambition: Rory to attend an [[Ivy League]] college and become a journalist, and Lorelai to open an inn with her best friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Sookie St. James|Sookie St. James]]. The romantic relationships of the protagonists are another key feature; throughout the series Lorelai has a \"will-they-won't-they\" dynamic with her friend, local diner owner [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Luke Danes|Luke Danes]], while also harboring unresolved feelings for Rory's father, Christopher. Lorelai also develops temporary feelings for Rory's English literature teacher, Max Medina and Jason \"Digger\" Stiles, who she has known since childhood. Rory's romantic journey throughout the show is based on the adolescent experiences of first-loves, flings, crushes, and college dates. While Rory has three committed boyfriends over the course of the show \u2013 local new-kid [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Dean Forrester|Dean Forrester]]; mysterious, well-read bad boy [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Jess Mariano|Jess Mariano]]; and wealthy, charismatic [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Logan Huntzberger|Logan Huntzberger]]\u2014she also has brief, romantically charged relationships with men whose love is unrequited: fellow Chilton student [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Tristan Dugray]] and Rory's only \"guy-bestie\" at Yale, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Marty]].\n\nThe quirky townspeople of Stars Hollow are a constant presence. Along with series-long and season-long arcs, ''Gilmore Girls'' is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode \u2013 such as town festivals, issues at Lorelai's inn, or school projects of Rory's.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 1)}}\n\nRory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate [[Paris Geller]], her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his, \"I love you\". She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has little interest in his advances. After being romantically pursued by Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory.  At the same time, Lorelai harbours a close friendship with the local diner owner, Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction\u2014but Lorelai is in denial and Luke doesn't act on it. Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 2)}}\n\nLorelai accepts Max's proposal, but realises shortly before the wedding that it doesn't feel right and they break up. She and Sookie get excited about opening their own business at the dilapidated Dragonfly Inn but the owner refuses to sell. Sookie gets engaged to Jackson Belleville, a local farmer. Luke's teenage nephew, Jess Mariano, comes to live under his care. Jess is sullen and angry with everyone apart from Rory. The two strike up a friendship, causing jealousy in Dean. Lorelai is disapproving of their closeness, labeling Jess as a bad influence, especially when they are in a car accident which leads to a blow-up with Luke. Richard announces that he has retired but soon becomes bored and sets up his own insurance company. Christopher appears to have his life together and Lorelai decides to reunite with him. But at Sookie's wedding Christopher learns that his recently estranged fianc\u00e9e is pregnant and decides to return to her, leaving Lorelai heartbroken. Meanwhile, Rory impulsively kisses Jess.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 3)}}\n\nRory's attraction to Jess grows stronger, and she gets jealous when he teases her with a new girlfriend. Dean can't ignore what is going on, and eventually ends their relationship. Rory and Jess immediately become a couple. Meanwhile, she and Paris spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to [[Harvard University]]. Paris is devastated when she doesn't get in. Rory is accepted but decides to attend [[Yale University]] instead, much to Emily and Richard's delight. The Independence Inn is badly damaged in a fire, but Lorelai and Sookie are able to buy the Dragonfly when its elderly owner dies. Jess pressures Rory to have sex with him, which leads to a fight between Dean and Jess. Luke begins dating a lawyer named Nicole. Lane Kim, Rory's best friend, starts a band called Hep Alien and tries to convince her strict mother to let her date the guitarist, Dave, while keeping the band secret. As the season ends, Jess abruptly leaves Stars Hollow to track down his estranged father in California, and Rory graduates High School as [[valedictorian]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 4)}}\n\nRory starts her college education at Yale, with Paris \u2013 now a friend \u2013 as her roommate. Both start working for the [[Yale Daily News]]. Rory is surprised when Dean quickly marries his new girlfriend. The pair grow closer again over the season, leading Rory to turn down Jess when he returns and declares his love. Lorelai spends the season renovating the Dragonfly Inn in preparation for its opening, along with Sookie and their colleague Michel. She also begins a relationship with Richard's new business partner, Jason Stiles, which she keeps secret from her parents. Lane's mother learns about Hep Alien and throws her out of the house. Sookie and Jackson have a son. Lorelai and Jason break up after Jason sues Richard for leaving their partnership and Lorelai sides with her father. Emily feels neglected by Richard and the two separate, with Richard moving into the pool house. Luke and Nicole [[elope]] during a cruise, but quickly decide to divorce. Towards the end of the season, Luke accepts that he is in love with Lorelai and begins wooing her. The pair finally kiss on the Dragonfly's opening night, while Rory loses her virginity to a married Dean.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 5)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke start a relationship. Emily and Richard \u2013 who reunite and renew their wedding vows \u2013 disapprove and Emily interferes by telling Christopher to try to win her back. Luke feels overwhelmed, resulting in a brief separation between him and Lorelai and a rift between Lorelai and Emily. Rory tries to have another relationship with Dean, now separated from his wife after she found out about the affair, but it soon ends when he realizes how different their lives are. She falls for Logan Huntzberger, a wealthy playboy Yale student whose parents think she is beneath him. Lane and Paris both start relationships: the former with her bandmate Zack, the latter with Yale Daily News editor Doyle. Sookie has a daughter. Rory gets an internship at Logan's father's newspaper but is deflated when he tells her she \"doesn't have it.\" Rory lashes out due to this and she and Logan are arrested for stealing a yacht, after which Rory announces that she is quitting Yale and moves in with her grandparents at their pool house. When Lorelai sees how supportive Luke is over the situation, she asks him to marry her.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 6)}}\n\nLorelai is devastated by Rory's actions but insists that she can't force her back to Yale: it's a decision Rory must make for herself. Mother and daughter don't speak for six months. Rory has to complete [[community service]] and Emily gets her a job with the [[Daughters of the American Revolution|DAR]]. Richard becomes concerned but eventually, after encouragement from Jess, Rory returns to Yale and reunites with Lorelai. She replaces Paris as editor of the Yale Daily News, which causes issues in their friendship, and after a short separation from Logan the relationship gets serious. Rory is crushed when Logan's father sends him to work in London. Hep Alien disband then come back together; Lane and Zack get married. Lorelai plans a wedding with Luke, but things get difficult when Luke learns that he has a 12-year-old daughter named April. He starts building a relationship with her but keeps Lorelai separate. Lorelai tries to accept this but eventually snaps and issues him an ultimatum. When he doesn't agree to elope, Lorelai goes to Christopher for comfort.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 7)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke officially split when she tells him she slept with Christopher. Before much time has passed, Christopher convinces Lorelai to try a relationship. The pair spontaneously marry during a trip in Paris, but Lorelai soon accepts that it isn't right and they split amicably. Luke has a custody battle over April, after her mother moves them to New Mexico, and wins the right to see her during holidays. Lane and Zack have twins, and Sookie becomes pregnant again. Rory completes her final year of college. She and Logan spend half the season in a long-distance relationship until he eventually moves back to New York. He proposes, but Rory says that she wants to keep her options open, which leads to their separation. She panics about what she will do after graduating; following some rejection, she gets a job reporting on the [[Barack Obama]] campaign trail. Stars Hollow throws a surprise goodbye party for Rory. When Lorelai finds out that Luke organized it, the pair reconcile with a kiss. Lorelai promises Emily that she will continue attending Friday Night Dinners. Before Lorelai and Rory have to say goodbye, they have one last breakfast at Luke's Diner.\n\n=== ''A Year in the Life'' ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life}}\n\nNine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a ''Gilmore Girls'' revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married the two of them can't seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany: she fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke. Emily decides to sell the Gilmore mansion and move to [[Nantucket]], where she starts working in a museum. After encouragement from Jess, Rory decides to write a book about her life called \"Gilmore Girls\".

Whole System Programme Management Report. 25 May 2011 http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rvfm-atkins-programme-management-250511.pdf</ref> Development started in 2009 and was based on the then current views of architectural description within London Underground which were based on ISO/IEC 42010 and tied to the [[Systems Engineering|systems engineering]] lifecyle defined in [[ISO/IEC 15288]] .\n\nAlthough the original intent was to develop a rail-specific architecture framework in adapting MODAF to suit local needs any defence or domain-specific content was removed and the result was a domain-free [[#TRAK Metamodel|metamodel]] and viewpoints that were only based on representing [[complex systems]].\n\nTRAK was [[#Licensing|released under open source licenses]] in February 2010.\n\nIt has been formally adopted by the [[Department for Transport|UK Department for Transport]] who chair the TRAK Steering Group that manages the overall direction, strategy and formal releases of TRAK.\n\nThe TRAK development team received a Working Group award.<ref>INCOSE 2010 Working Group Award http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>  (photo on the [[INCOSE]] Transportation Working Group page <ref>INCOSE Transportation Working Group  http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>). TRAK was a finalist for the 2011 IET Innovation Awards.<ref>IET Innovation Awards 2001 - Finalists http://conferences.theiet.org/innovation/finalists/index.cfm</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n;Architecture Description Tuple\n:An architectural description element with a named type which has a named relationship to either the same or another architecture description element e.g. Organisation A 'has part' Job B. It follows the natural language construct of Subject - [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|Predicate]] - Object - also used in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. See [[Tuple]]. TRAK requires each tuple to be explicit.\n\n;Master Architecture View\n:Each TRAK metamodel stereotype has a master architecture view type. Within an architecture description or model each element has to be declared or shown on its master architecture view type before it can be used on any other view type.\n\n;Perspective\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 refers to an Architectural Perspective as 'Sharing of architectural models also facilitates an \"aspect-oriented\" style of architectural description'<ref>[http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ ANSI/IEEE Std 1471 :: ISO/IEC 42010 Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems]</ref> A grouping of related and overlapping architectural views.\n\n;View\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]] refers to an architecture view as 'work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns'. A TRAK view is defined as an Architecture Product in the TRAK metamodel. A TRAK view presents a set of Architecture Description Tuples in accordance with its governing viewpoint.\n\n;Viewpoint\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 - A viewpoint defines a set of conventions (notations, languages and model types) for constructing a certain kind of view. In TRAK a viewpoint is a specification for a single TRAK view.\n\n==TRAK Structure==\nTRAK is defined in a logical way - that is to say free of any notion of how TRAK is implemented in any tool or any architecture description language.\n\nTRAK has 24 [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoints]] which are grouped into 5 perspectives. Each viewpoint belongs to a single perspective and specifies a single [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model Architecture View|view]] (type). Each viewpoint specifies what sets of types of architectural description element and relationships (tuples) can appear. The architectural description element types and relationships are specified by the TRAK metamodel.\n\nThe logical definition of TRAK consists of 3 documents, each of which is an open source project on [[Sourceforge]]:\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document.<ref name=\"trak\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework]</ref> This controls TRAK as a whole. It defines the TRAK Architecture Perspectives, colours, bye laws (rules affecting the design of TRAK, architecture views and architecture descriptions, minimal modelling process.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Viewpoints document.<ref name=\"viewpoints\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakviewpoints TRAK00001 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Viewpoints]</ref> This defines the TRAK architecture viewpoints.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Metamodel document.<ref name=\"metamodel\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakmetamodel TRAK00002 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Metamodel]</ref> This defines the architecture description elements that can appear in a viewpoint definition.\n\n==TRAK Architecture Perspectives==\nTRAK has 5 architecture perspectives,<ref name=\"trak\"/> each of which groups together architecture viewpoints and views of an overlapping subject area:\n* Enterprise Perspective\n* Concept Perspective\n* Procurement Perspective\n* Solution Perspective\n* Management Perspective\n\n===Enterprise Perspective===\nThis perspective covers the enduring capabilities that are needed as part of the bigger enterprise.These are high level needs that everything else contributes to and form part of the long term strategic objectives that need to be managed.\n\n===Concept Perspective===\nThe concept perspective covers the logical view of what is needed in response to the capabilities required by the enterprise in the enterprise perspective. It covers the logical connection of nodes, for example a service control centre, to other nodes with no recognition of how this might be realised either by organisation or technology. It also implies no particular part of a life cycle \u2013 it covers everything from concept to disposal (\"lust to dust\"!).\n\n===Procurement Perspective===\nThe procurement perspective provides a top level view of the solution to the enterprise capability needs outlined in the enterprise perspective and developed in the concept perspective. It provides a way of showing how projects deliver the solutions described in the solution perspective to provide capability. It provides a way of showing time dependency between projects and is an essential for investigating capability gaps.\n\n===Solution Perspective===\nThe solution perspective provides views about the solution \u2013 whether proposed or realised. It covers the parts of \u2018systems\u2019 whether human or machine, their exchanges and protocols. The solution perspective describes how organisations and equipment are organised and governed. The solution perspective describes how the logical requirements outlined in the concept perspective are realised and shows how the solution(s) realise the capability needed by the enterprise and described in the enterprise perspective.\n\n===Management Perspective===\nThe management perspective provides views that describe the architectural task and those relationships that are common across other perspectives. It provides ways of defining the scope and findings of the architectural task - structuring the approach and modelling.\n\nThe management perspective provides ways of describing the normative standards that apply. It contains views that provide supporting information to aid the portability and understanding of the model(s).\n\n==TRAK Architecture Viewpoints & Views==\nEach [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|architecture view]] in TRAK is specified by a corresponding [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoint]]. The viewpoint is designated using a 'p' in the numbering e.g. a CVp-01 is the architecture viewpoint that specifies a CV-01 architecture view.\n\nIn general use if there is a risk of confusion with a similarly-numbered view in another framework such as [[DODAF]] or [[MODAF]] then a namespace prefix is used e.g. TRAK::SV-01\n\nTRAK defines 24 architecture viewpoints<ref name=\"viewpoints\"/> (by comparison DODAF 2.0 has 52 views/models, MODAF 1.2.004 has 47 views and NAF 3.1 has 49 subviews <ref>Trak-community.org::Wiki::Architecture Framework Comparison http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/Architecture_Framework_Comparison</ref>)\n* Enterprise Perspective\n** EVp-01 Enterprise Goals\n** EVp-02 Capability Hierarchy\n** EVp-03 Capability Phasing\n* Concept Perspective\n** CVp-01 Concept Need\n** CVp-03 Concept Item Exchange\n** CVp-04 Concept Activity to Capability Mapping\n** CVp-05 Concept Activity\n** CVp-06 Concept Sequence\n* Procurement Perspective\n** PrVp-01 Procurement Structure\n** PrVp-02 Procurement Timeline\n** PrVp-03 Procurement Responsibility\n* Solution Perspective\n** SVp-01 Solution Structure\n** SVp-02 Solution Resource Interaction\n** SVp-03 Solution Resource Interaction to Function Mapping\n** SVp-04 Solution Function\n** SVp-05 Solution Function to Concept Activity Mapping\n** SVp-06 Solution Competence\n** SVp-07 Solution Sequence\n** SVp-11 Solution Event Causes\n** SVp-13 Solution Risk\n* Management Perspective\n** MVp-01 Architecture Description Dictionary\n** MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record\n** MVp-03 Requirements & Standards\n** MVp-04 Assurance\n\nThese defined in the TRAK Viewpoints specification. Additional information is provided in a community wiki.<ref>http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/TRAK:TRAK_Viewpoints</ref>\n\n==TRAK Metamodel==\n[[File:TRAK_metamodel_part_1.jpg|thumb|Metamodel for the TRAK enterprise architecture framework. Defines Allowed Metamodel Elements including Relationships for Use in TRAK Architecture Descriptions.]]\n[[File:TRAK_metamodel_part_2_safety_security.jpg|thumb|Defines the Architecture Description Elements (the triples / tuples that may appear in TRAK architecture views) that describe safety, security and risk.]]\n[[File:TRAK metamodel part 3 management.jpg|thumb|Part of the TRAK metamodel (used in the TRAK enterprise architecture framework). Describes the management perspective elements and their relationships (tuples).]]\n\nThe TRAK Metamodel<ref name=\"metamodel\"/> both simplifies and extends the basic concepts within the MODAF 1.2 metamodel. It has removed and redefined stereotypes and any defence-specific constructs have been removed. The TRAK Metamodel specification contains a comparison of the TRAK metamodel at initial release against MODAF 1.2.003. This is also outlined separately.<ref>http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/TRAK:Initial_TRAK_Baseline_vs_MODAF_-_Stereotypes</ref>\n\nThe TRAK metamodel is shown below. ''Note that this is not a controlled copy''.\n\nSignificant changes vs MODAF include:\n* the TRAK metamodel is aimed at users (the MODAF M3 is an abstract UML profile intended as a specification for tool vendors to implement MODAF - there is no metamodel for users only fragments of 'simplified metamodel' which aim to represent the more complicated M3). In TRAK the metamodel shown is the master one.\n* System is central to TRAK and can represent [[hard systems]] and [[soft systems]] (in MODAF 1.2.003 System is an artefact<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf MODAF Metamodel 1.2.004 MODAF version 1.2.004]</ref> and part of the Physical Architecture and cannot include non physical parts<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf The MODAF System Viewpoint(SV) 26 April 2010]</ref> )\n* TRAK can represent any type of interface exchange / flow - information, energy or resource\n* TRAK can represent exchange characteristics associated with human resources - Organisations, Jobs and Roles\n* TRAK includes means to represent requirements through the Standard (document/collection) and Requirement (atomic) metamodel elements and enforced by Contract\n* TRAK includes the means to plan and describe the architecture task and architecture description and its organisation as a view (MV-02 Architecture Description Design Record)\n* other types of dependency and associations can be represented - physical, membership, responsibility extent\n* TRAK includes the means to describe assurance cases (including design verification) using the Claim - Argument - Evidence construct\n* TRAK includes the means to describe safety / security - threats/hazards, vulnerabilities, mitigations and risk and causes / impacts\n* addition of ISO/IEC 42010 concepts to represent the architectural task, architecture description and architecture views - to allow a description of the task scope, purpose, findings\n* addition of consistency rules for content that apply to the entire collection of views and context to improve navigation and visibility of content\n* rules that constrain how and in what order relationships can be made to improve the consistency of the set of views that forms the architecture description\n\nStructurally there are other changes:\n* TRAK has 24 viewpoints (vs c 47 views in MODAF)\n* the each viewpoint content is defined in terms of tuples (a node - relationship - node element construct i.e. a triple or 1,[[Tuple|tuple]] ) and has allowed and minimum acceptable content and correspondence rules with respect to other views within the architecture description because this is needed to specify a uniquely addressable path in a metamodel (specifying a block metamodel element is not sufficient on its own where there are several relationships involving the element). \n* Since ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 defines architecture in terms of the relationship of a system to its environment the smallest unit of architecture description that may appear in a TRAK architecture view is therefore the Architecture Description Tuple i.e. node - relationship - node.\n\nThe way in which TRAK is managed and released via a set of open source projects is also quite different from other enterprise architecture frameworks. All change requests and feature requests and the sentencing of them are fully visible to anyone, not restricted to those who specify or develop the framework.<ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=393432</ref><ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Metamodel Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=304403</ref><ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Viewpoints Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=304405</ref> Releases are under change control and all history is maintained by versioning software ([[Subversion (software)|Subversion (SVN)]]).\n\n==Presentation of TRAK Views==\nTRAK does not specify a notation or presentation language ([[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Description Language|architecture description language]] in ISO/IEC 42010 terminology) in which to present the architecture views. TRAK architecture descriptions are not therefore [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]] or [[BPMN]] models although any of these notations  can be used to prepare at least some of the views (an ADL might not contain the necessary concepts/stereotypes or might not allow them to be connected in the way needed to represent a TRAK architecture view).\n\nTRAK requires the metamodel element name of every architecture description element in a TRAK architecture view to be explicitly shown so that each TRAK view can be read as a set of declarative statements e.g. \n* ''''System'''. A ''  -is configured with->  '' '''Software'''. B'\n* ''''Claim'''. System A meets the requirement to ... ''  -about->  '' '''Standard'''. Climatic Environmental Specification.'\n* ''''Physical'''. Shield Building ''  -has->   '' '''Vulnerability'''. Structural Weakness ''  <-exploits-  '' '''Threat'''. Deliberate Aircraft Impact'\n\nTuples can be presented using nodes and relationships (a graph).\n[[File:Example TRAK SV 13.jpg|frame|center|Example TRAK SV-13 Solution Risk View Presented as a Graph Showing Tuples from the TRAK Metamodel]]\n\nTRAK also allows a view to be constructed from textual statements. Since a TRAK view is a set of [[Tuple#Etymology|tuples / triples]] it is possible to use a graph or a set of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] triples to present a TRAK view. TRAK also requires every block to have a name. The intent of this is to ensure that a TRAK architecture view is read as the author of the view meant it and improve semantic consistency. Presentation rules that apply to all TRAK architecture views are specified in the overall TRAK specification <ref name=\"trak\"/><ref>[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture]</ref> (as 'Bye Laws').\n\nTRAK is a logical definition - it specifies what needs to be shown and minimum acceptable content but does not mandate how you achieve it. TRAK simply defines the node and connector elements and the allowed combinations (triples) that must / may appear in each view. It does not specify or mandate any particular notation or language. For example a simple block and connector diagram (as above) is acceptable as is a set of plain text statements or a diagram using the [[Unified_Modeling_Language|UML]].\n\n==ISO 42010 Considerations==\nTRAK applies [[ISO/IEC 42010]] in the following ways:-\n* an architecture description is a response to a task which addresses a stakeholder's concerns (this is addressed using the TRAK::MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record Viewpoint)\n* each TRAK architecture view is specified by a viewpoint within the TRAK architecture framework\n* each TRAK viewpoint identifies the stakeholders, concerns addressed, anti-concerns (things the viewpoint is not to be used for), the metamodel tuples needed, the metamodel tuples allowed, well-formedness (minimum acceptable content) and consistency rules with other views within the architecture description\n* correspondence rules are defined by viewpoints and for an architecture description using the TRAK metamodel.\n\nAn overall comparison between TRAK and [[ISO/IEC 42010]] is made in the TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document. A more detailed comparison against the 2011 version of the standard is made separately <ref name=\"TRAK00015\">TRAK00015 TRAK. \nArchitecture Description. Summary.

Whole System Programme Management Report. 25 May 2011 http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rvfm-atkins-programme-management-250511.pdf</ref> Development started in 2009 and was based on the then current views of architectural description within London Underground which were based on ISO/IEC 42010 and tied to the [[Systems Engineering|systems engineering]] lifecyle defined in [[ISO/IEC 15288]] .\n\nAlthough the original intent was to develop a rail-specific architecture framework in adapting MODAF to suit local needs any defence or domain-specific content was removed and the result was a domain-free [[#TRAK Metamodel|metamodel]] and viewpoints that were only based on representing [[complex systems]].\n\nTRAK was [[#Licensing|released under open source licenses]] in February 2010.\n\nIt has been formally adopted by the [[Department for Transport|UK Department for Transport]] who chair the TRAK Steering Group that manages the overall direction, strategy and formal releases of TRAK.\n\nThe TRAK development team received a Working Group award.<ref>INCOSE 2010 Working Group Award http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>  (photo on the [[INCOSE]] Transportation Working Group page <ref>INCOSE Transportation Working Group  http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/transport/</ref>). TRAK was a finalist for the 2011 IET Innovation Awards.<ref>IET Innovation Awards 2001 - Finalists http://conferences.theiet.org/innovation/finalists/index.cfm</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n;Architecture Description Tuple\n:An architectural description element with a named type which has a named relationship to either the same or another architecture description element e.g. <<Organisation>> A 'has part' <<Job>> B. It follows the natural language construct of Subject - [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|Predicate]] - Object - also used in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. See [[Tuple]]. TRAK requires each tuple to be explicit.\n\n;Master Architecture View\n:Each TRAK metamodel stereotype has a master architecture view type. Within an architecture description or model each element has to be declared or shown on its master architecture view type before it can be used on any other view type.\n\n;Perspective\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 refers to an Architectural Perspective as 'Sharing of architectural models also facilitates an \"aspect-oriented\" style of architectural description'<ref>[http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ ANSI/IEEE Std 1471 :: ISO/IEC 42010 Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems]</ref> A grouping of related and overlapping architectural views.\n\n;View\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]] refers to an architecture view as 'work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns'. A TRAK view is defined as an Architecture Product in the TRAK metamodel. A TRAK view presents a set of Architecture Description Tuples in accordance with its governing viewpoint.\n\n;Viewpoint\n:[[ISO/IEC 42010]]:2007 - A viewpoint defines a set of conventions (notations, languages and model types) for constructing a certain kind of view. In TRAK a viewpoint is a specification for a single TRAK view.\n\n==TRAK Structure==\nTRAK is defined in a logical way - that is to say free of any notion of how TRAK is implemented in any tool or any architecture description language.\n\nTRAK has 24 [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoints]] which are grouped into 5 perspectives. Each viewpoint belongs to a single perspective and specifies a single [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model Architecture View|view]] (type). Each viewpoint specifies what sets of types of architectural description element and relationships (tuples) can appear. The architectural description element types and relationships are specified by the TRAK metamodel.\n\nThe logical definition of TRAK consists of 3 documents, each of which is an open source project on [[Sourceforge]]:\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document.<ref name=\"trak\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework]</ref> This controls TRAK as a whole. It defines the TRAK Architecture Perspectives, colours, bye laws (rules affecting the design of TRAK, architecture views and architecture descriptions, minimal modelling process.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Viewpoints document.<ref name=\"viewpoints\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakviewpoints TRAK00001 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Viewpoints]</ref> This defines the TRAK architecture viewpoints.\n* TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework Metamodel document.<ref name=\"metamodel\">[http://sourceforge.net/p/trakmetamodel TRAK00002 TRAK. Enterprise Architecture Framework. Metamodel]</ref> This defines the architecture description elements that can appear in a viewpoint definition.\n\n==TRAK Architecture Perspectives==\nTRAK has 5 architecture perspectives,<ref name=\"trak\"/> each of which groups together architecture viewpoints and views of an overlapping subject area:\n* Enterprise Perspective\n* Concept Perspective\n* Procurement Perspective\n* Solution Perspective\n* Management Perspective\n\n===Enterprise Perspective===\nThis perspective covers the enduring capabilities that are needed as part of the bigger enterprise.These are high level needs that everything else contributes to and form part of the long term strategic objectives that need to be managed.\n\n===Concept Perspective===\nThe concept perspective covers the logical view of what is needed in response to the capabilities required by the enterprise in the enterprise perspective. It covers the logical connection of nodes, for example a service control centre, to other nodes with no recognition of how this might be realised either by organisation or technology. It also implies no particular part of a life cycle \u2013 it covers everything from concept to disposal (\"lust to dust\"!).\n\n===Procurement Perspective===\nThe procurement perspective provides a top level view of the solution to the enterprise capability needs outlined in the enterprise perspective and developed in the concept perspective. It provides a way of showing how projects deliver the solutions described in the solution perspective to provide capability. It provides a way of showing time dependency between projects and is an essential for investigating capability gaps.\n\n===Solution Perspective===\nThe solution perspective provides views about the solution \u2013 whether proposed or realised. It covers the parts of \u2018systems\u2019 whether human or machine, their exchanges and protocols. The solution perspective describes how organisations and equipment are organised and governed. The solution perspective describes how the logical requirements outlined in the concept perspective are realised and shows how the solution(s) realise the capability needed by the enterprise and described in the enterprise perspective.\n\n===Management Perspective===\nThe management perspective provides views that describe the architectural task and those relationships that are common across other perspectives. It provides ways of defining the scope and findings of the architectural task - structuring the approach and modelling.\n\nThe management perspective provides ways of describing the normative standards that apply. It contains views that provide supporting information to aid the portability and understanding of the model(s).\n\n==TRAK Architecture Viewpoints & Views==\nEach [[ISO/IEC 42010#Conceptual Model - Architecture View|architecture view]] in TRAK is specified by a corresponding [[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Viewpoint|architecture viewpoint]]. The viewpoint is designated using a 'p' in the numbering e.g. a CVp-01 is the architecture viewpoint that specifies a CV-01 architecture view.\n\nIn general use if there is a risk of confusion with a similarly-numbered view in another framework such as [[DODAF]] or [[MODAF]] then a namespace prefix is used e.g. TRAK::SV-01\n\nTRAK defines 24 architecture viewpoints<ref name=\"viewpoints\"/> (by comparison DODAF 2.0 has 52 views/models, MODAF 1.2.004 has 47 views and NAF 3.1 has 49 subviews <ref>Trak-community.org::Wiki::Architecture Framework Comparison http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/Architecture_Framework_Comparison</ref>)\n* Enterprise Perspective\n** EVp-01 Enterprise Goals\n** EVp-02 Capability Hierarchy\n** EVp-03 Capability Phasing\n* Concept Perspective\n** CVp-01 Concept Need\n** CVp-03 Concept Item Exchange\n** CVp-04 Concept Activity to Capability Mapping\n** CVp-05 Concept Activity\n** CVp-06 Concept Sequence\n* Procurement Perspective\n** PrVp-01 Procurement Structure\n** PrVp-02 Procurement Timeline\n** PrVp-03 Procurement Responsibility\n* Solution Perspective\n** SVp-01 Solution Structure\n** SVp-02 Solution Resource Interaction\n** SVp-03 Solution Resource Interaction to Function Mapping\n** SVp-04 Solution Function\n** SVp-05 Solution Function to Concept Activity Mapping\n** SVp-06 Solution Competence\n** SVp-07 Solution Sequence\n** SVp-11 Solution Event Causes\n** SVp-13 Solution Risk\n* Management Perspective\n** MVp-01 Architecture Description Dictionary\n** MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record\n** MVp-03 Requirements & Standards\n** MVp-04 Assurance\n\nThese defined in the TRAK Viewpoints specification. Additional information is provided in a community wiki.<ref>http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/TRAK:TRAK_Viewpoints</ref>\n\n==TRAK Metamodel==\n[[File:TRAK_metamodel_part_1.jpg|thumb|Metamodel for the TRAK enterprise architecture framework. Defines Allowed Metamodel Elements including Relationships for Use in TRAK Architecture Descriptions.]]\n[[File:TRAK_metamodel_part_2_safety_security.jpg|thumb|Defines the Architecture Description Elements (the triples / tuples that may appear in TRAK architecture views) that describe safety, security and risk.]]\n[[File:TRAK metamodel part 3 management.jpg|thumb|Part of the TRAK metamodel (used in the TRAK enterprise architecture framework). Describes the management perspective elements and their relationships (tuples).]]\n\nThe TRAK Metamodel<ref name=\"metamodel\"/> both simplifies and extends the basic concepts within the MODAF 1.2 metamodel. It has removed and redefined stereotypes and any defence-specific constructs have been removed. The TRAK Metamodel specification contains a comparison of the TRAK metamodel at initial release against MODAF 1.2.003. This is also outlined separately.<ref>http://trak-community.org/index.php/wiki/TRAK:Initial_TRAK_Baseline_vs_MODAF_-_Stereotypes</ref>\n\nThe TRAK metamodel is shown below. ''Note that this is not a controlled copy''.\n\nSignificant changes vs MODAF include:\n* the TRAK metamodel is aimed at users (the MODAF M3 is an abstract UML profile intended as a specification for tool vendors to implement MODAF - there is no metamodel for users only fragments of 'simplified metamodel' which aim to represent the more complicated M3). In TRAK the metamodel shown is the master one.\n* System is central to TRAK and can represent [[hard systems]] and [[soft systems]] (in MODAF 1.2.003 System is an artefact<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf MODAF Metamodel 1.2.004 MODAF version 1.2.004]</ref> and part of the Physical Architecture and cannot include non physical parts<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/38715/20100426MODAFSVViewpointV1_2_004U.pdf The MODAF System Viewpoint(SV) 26 April 2010]</ref> )\n* TRAK can represent any type of interface exchange / flow - information, energy or resource\n* TRAK can represent exchange characteristics associated with human resources - Organisations, Jobs and Roles\n* TRAK includes means to represent requirements through the Standard (document/collection) and Requirement (atomic) metamodel elements and enforced by Contract\n* TRAK includes the means to plan and describe the architecture task and architecture description and its organisation as a view (MV-02 Architecture Description Design Record)\n* other types of dependency and associations can be represented - physical, membership, responsibility extent\n* TRAK includes the means to describe assurance cases (including design verification) using the Claim - Argument - Evidence construct\n* TRAK includes the means to describe safety / security - threats/hazards, vulnerabilities, mitigations and risk and causes / impacts\n* addition of ISO/IEC 42010 concepts to represent the architectural task, architecture description and architecture views - to allow a description of the task scope, purpose, findings\n* addition of consistency rules for content that apply to the entire collection of views and context to improve navigation and visibility of content\n* rules that constrain how and in what order relationships can be made to improve the consistency of the set of views that forms the architecture description\n\nStructurally there are other changes:\n* TRAK has 24 viewpoints (vs c 47 views in MODAF)\n* the each viewpoint content is defined in terms of tuples (a node - relationship - node element construct i.e. a triple or 1,[[Tuple|tuple]] ) and has allowed and minimum acceptable content and correspondence rules with respect to other views within the architecture description because this is needed to specify a uniquely addressable path in a metamodel (specifying a block metamodel element is not sufficient on its own where there are several relationships involving the element). \n* Since ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 defines architecture in terms of the relationship of a system to its environment the smallest unit of architecture description that may appear in a TRAK architecture view is therefore the Architecture Description Tuple i.e. node - relationship - node.\n\nThe way in which TRAK is managed and released via a set of open source projects is also quite different from other enterprise architecture frameworks. All change requests and feature requests and the sentencing of them are fully visible to anyone, not restricted to those who specify or develop the framework.<ref>Sourceforge. TRAK Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=393432</ref><ref>Sourceforge.

TRAK Viewpoints Project Bug/Change Trackers. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=304405</ref> Releases are under change control and all history is maintained by versioning software ([[Subversion (software)|Subversion (SVN)]]).\n\n==Presentation of TRAK Views==\nTRAK does not specify a notation or presentation language ([[ISO/IEC 42010#Architecture Description Language|architecture description language]] in ISO/IEC 42010 terminology) in which to present the architecture views. TRAK architecture descriptions are not therefore [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]] or [[BPMN]] models although any of these notations  can be used to prepare at least some of the views (an ADL might not contain the necessary concepts/stereotypes or might not allow them to be connected in the way needed to represent a TRAK architecture view).\n\nTRAK requires the metamodel element name of every architecture description element in a TRAK architecture view to be explicitly shown so that each TRAK view can be read as a set of declarative statements e.g. \n* ''''System'''. A ''  -is configured with->  '' '''Software'''. B'\n* ''''Claim'''. System A meets the requirement to ... ''  -about->  '' '''Standard'''. Climatic Environmental Specification.'\n* ''''Physical'''. Shield Building ''  -has->   '' '''Vulnerability'''. Structural Weakness ''  <-exploits-  '' '''Threat'''. Deliberate Aircraft Impact'\n\nTuples can be presented using nodes and relationships (a graph).\n[[File:Example TRAK SV 13.jpg|frame|center|Example TRAK SV-13 Solution Risk View Presented as a Graph Showing Tuples from the TRAK Metamodel]]\n\nTRAK also allows a view to be constructed from textual statements. Since a TRAK view is a set of [[Tuple#Etymology|tuples / triples]] it is possible to use a graph or a set of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] triples to present a TRAK view. TRAK also requires every block to have a name. The intent of this is to ensure that a TRAK architecture view is read as the author of the view meant it and improve semantic consistency. Presentation rules that apply to all TRAK architecture views are specified in the overall TRAK specification <ref name=\"trak\"/><ref>[http://sourceforge.net/p/trak TRAK Enterprise Architecture]</ref> (as 'Bye Laws').\n\nTRAK is a logical definition - it specifies what needs to be shown and minimum acceptable content but does not mandate how you achieve it. TRAK simply defines the node and connector elements and the allowed combinations (triples) that must / may appear in each view. It does not specify or mandate any particular notation or language. For example a simple block and connector diagram (as above) is acceptable as is a set of plain text statements or a diagram using the [[Unified_Modeling_Language|UML]].\n\n==ISO 42010 Considerations==\nTRAK applies [[ISO/IEC 42010]] in the following ways:-\n* an architecture description is a response to a task which addresses a stakeholder's concerns (this is addressed using the TRAK::MVp-02 Architecture Description Design Record Viewpoint)\n* each TRAK architecture view is specified by a viewpoint within the TRAK architecture framework\n* each TRAK viewpoint identifies the stakeholders, concerns addressed, anti-concerns (things the viewpoint is not to be used for), the metamodel tuples needed, the metamodel tuples allowed, well-formedness (minimum acceptable content) and consistency rules with other views within the architecture description\n* correspondence rules are defined by viewpoints and for an architecture description using the TRAK metamodel.\n\nAn overall comparison between TRAK and [[ISO/IEC 42010]] is made in the TRAK Enterprise Architecture Framework document. A more detailed comparison against the 2011 version of the standard is made separately <ref name=\"TRAK00015\">TRAK00015 TRAK. \nArchitecture Description. Summary.

It is characterised by the processes of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the [[trophoblast]]) and an [[inner cell mass]]. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the [[zona pellucida]]. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the [[blastula]].) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to [[zona hatching|hatch]] through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.<ref>http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the [[pre-embryo]],<ref name=\"opentext\">{{cite web |title=28.2 Embryonic Development \u2013 Anatomy and Physiology |url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/28-2-embryonic-development/ |website=opentextbc.ca}}</ref> the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer.

These columns are known as [[Chorionic villi|primary villi]]. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Moore/>\n\n=== Implantation ===\n{{Main|Implantation (human embryo)}}\n[[File:Gray36.png|thumb|200px|Trophoblast differentiation]]\nAfter [[ovulation]], the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden  |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston |pages = |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=0-13-250882-6 }}</ref> The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Smith/>\nArteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth.

[[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of [[somitogenesis]] will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,<ref name=\"pmid12705871\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201348 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X}}</ref> the\n[[myotome]] and the [[dermatome (embryology)|dermatome]] to form [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], [[tendon]]s, [[dermis]] (skin), and [[muscle]].

This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/> Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo|vascular remodelling]] takes place.\n\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth.

The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes).

These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[otic pit]]s, and then [[otic vesicle]]s. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.\n\nThe ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].\n\nThe dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].\n\n==== Middle ear ====\nThe [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity.

It is characterised by the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst.

It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Smith/>\nArteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of [[neurulation]] can begin.\n\n==Neurulation==\n{{Main|Neurulation}}\n[[File:Neural crest.svg|220px|thumb|left|Neural plate]]\n[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.png|thumb|280px|Neural tube development]]\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and [[nervous tissue|neural tissue]], and the gastrula is now referred to as the [[neurula]].

[[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of [[somitogenesis]] will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,<ref name=\"pmid12705871\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201348 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X}}</ref> the\n[[myotome]] and the [[dermatome (embryology)|dermatome]] to form [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], [[tendon]]s, [[dermis]] (skin), and [[muscle]].

This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/> Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo|vascular remodelling]] takes place.\n\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth.

The deeper layer, the [[dermis]], is derived from [[mesenchyme]].\n\nThe formation of the epidermis begins in the second month of development and it acquires its definitive arrangement at the end of the fourth month. The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual [[Epidermis#Layers|layers of the epidermis]].\n\nThe mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources:\n\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from [[paraxial mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from [[Neural crest|neural crest cells]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n{{Main|Development of the nervous system in humans |Development of the human brain}}\n[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|240px|Development of brain in 8 week old embryo]]\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube bends ventrally as the [[Flexure (embryology)|cephalic flexure]] at the level of the future [[midbrain]]\u2014the [[mesencephalon]]. Above the mesencephalon is the [[prosencephalon]] (future forebrain) and beneath it is the [[rhombencephalon]] (future hindbrain).\n\n[[Cranial neural crest]] cells migrate to the [[pharyngeal arch]]es as [[neural stem cell]]s, where they develop in the process of [[neurogenesis]] into [[neuron]]s.\n\nThe [[optic vesicle|optical vesicle]] (which eventually becomes the [[optic nerve]], [[retina]] and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon. The [[alar plate]] of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] becomes the diencephalon. Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth.\n\n==Development of physical features==\n===Face and neck===\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|Face and neck development of the embryo}}\nFrom the third to the eighth week the [[face and neck development of the embryo|face and neck develop]].\n\n=== Ears ===\n{{See also|Ear#Development}}The [[inner ear]], [[middle ear]] and [[outer ear]] have distinct embryological origins.\n\n==== Inner ear ====\nAt about 22 days into development, the [[ectoderm]] on each side of the [[Hindbrain|rhombencephalon]] thickens to form [[otic placode]]s. These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[otic pit]]s, and then [[otic vesicle]]s. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.\n\nThe ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].\n\nThe dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].\n\n==== Middle ear ====\nThe [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube.\n\nThe [[bone]]s of the middle ear, the [[ossicles]], derive from the cartilages of the [[pharyngeal arch]]es. The [[malleus]] and [[incus]] derive from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#First arch|first pharyngeal arch]], whereas the [[stapes]] derives from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#Second arch|second pharyngeal arch]].\n\n==== Outer ear ====\nThe [[Ear canal|external auditory meatus]] develops from the dorsal portion of the first [[Pharyngeal groove|pharyngeal cleft]]. Six auricular hillocks, which are mesenchymal proliferations at the dorsal aspects of the first and second pharyngeal arches, form the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]] of the ear.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Eyes===\n{{Main |Eye development}}\nThe eyes begin to develop from the third week to the tenth week.\n[[File:Movements at gestational age of 9 weeks.gif|thumb|Movements of embryo at 9 weeks gestational age.]]\n\n===Limbs===\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\n{{main|Limb development|Limb bud}}\n{{Further |Zone of polarizing activity}}\nAt the end of the fourth week [[limb development]] begins. [[Limb bud]]s appear on the ventrolateral aspect of the body. They consist of an outer layer of [[ectoderm]] and an inner part consisting of [[mesenchyme]] which is derived from the parietal layer of [[lateral plate mesoderm]]. Ectodermal cells at the distal end of the buds form the [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which creates an area of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal cells known as the [[progress zone]]. [[Cartilage]] (some of which ultimately becomes [[bone]]) and muscle develop from the mesenchyme.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{Further |Prenatal testing |Environmental toxicants and fetal development}}\n{{See also|Obstetric ultrasonography}}\nToxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major [[congenital malformation]]s, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing.\n\nEach cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the [[cellular differentiation|different cell types]] in the developing embryo. This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].\n\n[[Sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.<ref name=Carlson/><ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Larsen/>\n\n[[First arch syndrome]]s are [[congenital disorder]]s of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\n\n[[Spina bifida]] a [[congenital disorder]] is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\n\n[[Vertically transmitted infection]]s can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its [[prenatal development|development]].\n\n[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a [[preterm birth|preterm]] or premature birth.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros]]\n* [[CDX2]]\n* [[Development of the reproductive system]]\n* [[Development of the urinary system]]\n* [[Developmental biology]]\n* [[Drosophila embryogenesis]]\n* [[Embryomics]]\n* [[Gonadogenesis]]\n* [[Human tooth development]]\n* [[List of human cell types derived from the germ layers]]\n* [[Potential person]]\n* [[Recapitulation theory]]\n\n==Additional images==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 01.jpg|Representing different stages of embryogenesis\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 05.jpg|Early stage of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 03.jpg|Phase of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 04.jpg|Top of the form of the embryo\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 02.jpg|Establishment of embryo medium\nFile:Sobo 1909 621.png|Spinal cord at 5 weeks\nFile:Gray947.png|Head and neck at 32 days\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Human embryos}}\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/images/stem_blastocyst.jpg Photo of blastocyst in utero]\n* Slideshow: [https://web.archive.org/web/20161222152312/http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/99/womb In the Womb]\n* [http://www.embryology.ch/indexen.html Online course in embryology] for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern\n\n{{Embryology}}\n{{Human development}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Embryogenesis}}\n[[Category:Embryology]]\n[[Category:Human biology]]\n", "name_user": "Iztwoz", "label": "safe", "comment": "links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_embryonic_development"}

The degree-awarding authorities approved by the [[Government of Ireland]], which can grant awards at all academic levels, are [[University of Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Technological University Dublin]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] (Pontifical University),<ref>''Final report on alignment of St. Patrick\u2019s College, Maynooth awards made in Ireland to the National Framework of Qualifications'' www.nqai.ie, September 2011.</ref>  and [[University of Limerick]].  The [[King's Inns]] of [[Dublin]] has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of [[barrister|barrister-at-law]] to practice as barristers.

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:<ref name=\"studentfinance.ie\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |title       = Undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration in colleges in List 1\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125031716/http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |archivedate = 25 January 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Student Finance.ie, information for Undergradute students</ref>\n\n* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]], or those who have been granted official [[refugee]] status.\n* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.\n* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.\n\nStudents are required to pay a \"registration fee\" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges for 2008/09 were on average \u20ac850 per student, but was raised to \u20ac1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year.<ref name=\"Fees FAQ\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ucd.ie/registry/adminservices/fees/faq.html\n |title=Fees FAQ \n |accessdate=2010-02-24}} University College Dublin, Administrative Services - Fees & Grants</ref> These charges have been labelled as \"unofficial fees\", and University Heads have admitted that \"student registration charges are fees by any other name\".<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/universities-admit-student-charge-is-an-unofficial-fee-2038465.html\n |title=Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee\n |accessdate=2010-02-24\n | work=Irish Independent\n |date=29 January 2010}} Independent.ie - Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee</ref>\nIn 2011, after large annual increases, the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution.

Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as [[Post Leaving Certificate]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/alternative-career-routes-boost-options-for-school-leavers-1.3972995\n | title =Alternative career routes boost options for school-leavers\n | last =Mooney\n | first =Brian\n | date =17 August 2019\n | website =Irish Times\n | access-date =17 August 2019\n | quote =Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside the traditional CAO system. }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]] conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence. There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology. FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education. FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minister Quinn merges educational agencies to establish QQI | url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2012-Press-Releases/PR2012-11-06.html|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Increase in third-level degrees==\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country, although many third-level students are better suited to further education and training. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

The degree-awarding authorities approved by the [[Government of Ireland]], which can grant awards at all academic levels, are [[University of Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Technological University Dublin]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] (Pontifical University),<ref>''Final report on alignment of St. Patrick\u2019s College, Maynooth awards made in Ireland to the National Framework of Qualifications'' www.nqai.ie, September 2011.</ref>  and [[University of Limerick]].  The [[King's Inns]] of [[Dublin]] has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of [[barrister|barrister-at-law]] to practice as barristers. [[Medical school#Ireland|Medical schools in Ireland]] also have particular regulation.

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:<ref name=\"studentfinance.ie\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |title       = Undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration in colleges in List 1\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125031716/http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9386/undergraduate-courses-of-not-less-than-two-years-duration-in-colleges-in-list-1/index.html\n |archivedate = 25 January 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Student Finance.ie, information for Undergradute students</ref>\n\n* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]], or those who have been granted official [[refugee]] status.\n* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.\n* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.\n\nStudents are required to pay a \"registration fee\" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges for 2008/09 were on average \u20ac850 per student, but was raised to \u20ac1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year.<ref name=\"Fees FAQ\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ucd.ie/registry/adminservices/fees/faq.html\n |title=Fees FAQ \n |accessdate=2010-02-24}} University College Dublin, Administrative Services - Fees & Grants</ref> These charges have been labelled as \"unofficial fees\", and University Heads have admitted that \"student registration charges are fees by any other name\".<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/universities-admit-student-charge-is-an-unofficial-fee-2038465.html\n |title=Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee\n |accessdate=2010-02-24\n | work=Irish Independent\n |date=29 January 2010}} Independent.ie - Universities admit student charge is an unofficial fee</ref>\nIn 2011, after large annual increases, the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution. For the school year 2019/2020 this fee stands at \u20ac3,000.\n\n==Further education==\n{{see also|List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland}}\nFurther education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education. Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as [[Post Leaving Certificate]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/alternative-career-routes-boost-options-for-school-leavers-1.3972995\n | title =Alternative career routes boost options for school-leavers\n | last =Mooney\n | first =Brian\n | date =17 August 2019\n | website =Irish Times\n | access-date =17 August 2019\n | quote =Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside the traditional CAO system. }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]] conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence. There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology. FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education. FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minister Quinn merges educational agencies to establish QQI | url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2012-Press-Releases/PR2012-11-06.html|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Increase in third-level degrees==\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country, although many third-level students are better suited to further education and training. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in the Football League since 1900.

The club wasn't re-elected and spent one season outside the Football League before being elected back again at the end of 1904\u201305. Stockport then competed in it continuously for 106 years from 1905 to 2011. The team spent most of their history in the lower reaches of the Football League, having to seek re-election on many further occasions. Stockport won their first league championship in 1922 coming top of the newly created [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]].

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.
