On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''\n\n== Later career and death ==\nAfter action in the Pacific, Leder was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) as part of an Army Air Force flying school operated under the [[Air Materiel Command|Air Force Technical Service Command]].

He enlisted in the Navy on April 12, 1941 and was initially stationed at the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul_Joint_Air_Reserve_Station|Naval Reserve Aviation Base]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949</ref>. He attended flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. On May 18, 1942, he married Kathryn Silvia Loran <ref>Florida, County Marriage Records, 1823-1982</ref> before being shipped out to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].\n\n== World War II ==\nLeder flew for the [[VF-10|VF-10 Air Group]] as a member of what was known as the [[Cactus Air Force]] starting in July of 1942. He was stationed on the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]] during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]]. On October 26th, 1942 he shot down at least one enemy dive bomber in defense of the Enterprise. On November 13, 1942, he was part of a four plane combat patrol that shot down a Japanese bomber that was shadowing the Enterprise and its task force. Later on January 3, 1943, he shot down a torpedo bomber attempting to attack the cruiser [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|Chicago]] as it sat damaged near [[Rennell Island]].\n\n== Air Medal ==\nLeder was nominated by his commander for the Distinguished Flying Cross and was ultimately awarded the [[Air Medal]] for his actions in the Pacific.\n\n'''Citation:'''\n\n''Conspicuous courage and skill in air combat with the enemy. On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''\n\n== Later career and death ==\nAfter action in the Pacific, Leder was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) as part of an Army Air Force flying school operated under the Air Force Technical Service Command. He worked as a flight instructor, training new pilots for service. On September 5th, 1943, his trainer caught fire midair, and he crashed near the airfield and was killed <ref>{{cite news |title=Flyer is Killed in Plane Crash |publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=September 8, 1943}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Naval Flier Killed |work=Page 4 |publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=September 9, 1943}}</ref>.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leder, William H.}}\n[[Category:Recipients of the Air Medal]]\n[[Category:United States Navy pilots of World War II]]\n[[Category:Aviators from North Dakota]]\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1943 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Brykeller", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added link to Air Materiel Command which used to be designated  Air Force Technical Service Command at the time of Leder's death", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Leder"}
