George|GCMG]], [[Order of British Empire|KBE]] (6 May 1920 \u2013 18 April 2004) was a Fijian politician, who served as [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] from 1967 to 1970, when Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom, and, apart from one brief interruption in 1987, the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|first Prime Minister]] from 1970 to 1992. He subsequently served as [[President of Fiji|President]] from 1993 to 2000. He is considered the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the modern nation of Fiji.\n\n==Early life and education: 1920 to 1950==\n'''Ratu Sir Kamisese Kapaiwai Tuimacilai Uluilakeba Mara''' was born on 6 May 1920, in Sawana, Lomaloma, Vanuabalavu in the archipelago of [[Lau Islands|Lau]], the son of [[Tevita Uluilakeba III|Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba]], Tui Nayau and head of the chiefly [[Vuanirewa]] clan of Tubou, Lakeba and [[Lusiana Qolikoro]] from the Fonolahi Family of the Yavusa Tonga clan in Sawana. Fonolahi has lineage to the Tongan royalty and was also descended from an English missionary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara's title, ''Ratu'', which means \"Chief,\" was hereditary; as the hereditary Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, he held the titles of ''[[Tui Lau]]'' in 1963, and ''[[Tui Nayau|Tui Nayau kei Sau ni Vanua ko Lau]]'' in 1969. He succeeded to the ''Tui Nayau'' title in 1969, following the death of his father in 1966. He was earlier installed as ''Tui Lau'' in 1963 following the traditional consultation process between the Yavusa Tonga in Sawana, Lomaloma and the Tui Nayau his father. Though the title Tui Lau is not hereditary it has been left vacant by his cousin\u00b9 [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], who had died in 1958.'''{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara was educated first at Marist Brothers' Primary School (Fiji) before he left for his final year in [[Marist Brothers High School, Fiji|Marist Brothers High School, Suva]] and [[Sacred Heart College, Auckland]]. He then attended the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, where he studied medicine (1942 to 1945). He never finished his medical studies, because his great-uncle and mentor, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (who was then regarded as Fiji's paramount chief), seeking to groom him for future leadership of the nation, arranged for him to study history at [[Wadham College, Oxford]] in the United Kingdom. Mara was distressed to abandon his medical studies, but, dependent on Ratu Sukuna for financial support, followed his orders without question, and graduated with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1949. In 1961, he returned to the United Kingdom to pursue postgraduate study at the [[London School of Economics]] for a Diploma in Economics and Social Administration, which he was awarded in 1962. In 1973, his old alma mater, Otago University, awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws ([[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFollowing his graduation from Oxford University, Mara returned to Fiji and had married [[Lala Mara|Ro Litia Cakobau Lalabalavu Katoafutoga Tuisawau]], better known as Ro Lady Lala Mara, on 9 September 1950. Her title, ''[[Ro (title)|Ro]]'', is also hereditary and is held by [[Rewa Province|Rewan]] chiefs; like her husband, Ro Lala was a chief in her own right, as the ''[[Roko Tui Dreketi]]'' (Paramount Chief) of [[Burebasaga]] and [[Rewa Province|Rewa]]. The marriage was initially opposed by some members of Mara's family, as Ro Lala was from a rival dynasty with which the [[Vuanirewa|Mara clan]] had a history of strained relations. The marriage proved to be a happy one, however, and in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce among many of Mara's relatives, it lasted for more than 53 years. They had three sons and five daughters, two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, was a [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet Minister]] and [[House of Representatives of Fiji|parliamentary]] leader of the [[Fijian Association Party]] from 1996 to 1998, when he resigned to take up a diplomatic posting. Their second daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, has also followed in her father's footsteps and has served her country as a career diplomat and politician. She was [[Minister for Transport (Fiji)|Minister for Transport]] and [[Minister for Tourism (Fiji)|Tourism]] in 1999 and 2000, and served in the [[Senate of Fiji|Fijian Senate]] from 2001 to 2006.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==The making of a statesman: 1950 to 1970==\nAfter serving (from 1950) as an Administrative Officer in the Colonial Services, Mara was nominated to one of five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] reserved for ethnic Fijians in 1953. (There were ten other seats, five reserved for Indians and five for Europeans and other minorities; a further sixteen members were appointed by the colonial Governor). In 1959, Mara was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]], and in 1963 was given responsibility as Leader of Government Business and Member for Natural Resources (officially an advisor to the Governor, but in reality roughly equivalent to a modern [[minister (government)|cabinet minister]]). In 1964, he was received into the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], which at that time was empowered to appoint two members to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]]. In 1966, he founded the Alliance Party, which, supported overwhelmingly by the ethnic Fijian and European communities (but not by most [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]]), won a majority of the seats in the 1966 [[1966 Fijian general election|election]]. In preparation for independence, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Westminster System|Westminster (Cabinet) system]] of government to Fiji in October 1967. The Executive Council was transformed into a modern Cabinet, and its members, who had hitherto been answerable only to the colonial [[Governor of Fiji|Governor]], were made fully responsible to the [[Parliament of Fiji|legislature]]. Mara was named to the new position of Chief Minister.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOne problem that threatened to delay independence was the failure of [[Fijians|ethnic Fijians]] and Indo-Fijians to agree on a post-independence [[1970 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]]. Ethnic Fijians, including Mara, wanted a communal franchise, with parliamentary seats reserved for the different ethnic groups, who would vote on separate electoral rolls. It was believed that this would protect indigenous Fijian rights. Mara also considered that it was in Fiji's interests to avoid direct competition between political candidates from different ethnic groups, fearing that it would lead to social and political upheaval. Most Indo-Fijians rejected this proposal, believing that it would prevent them from obtaining a legislative majority, even though they numbered more than half of the population, and demanded that all Parliamentary seats should be elected by universal suffrage from a common voters' roll. In April 1970, Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], leader of the mainly Indo-Fijian [[National Federation Party]], met in London and negotiated a compromise. Fijians and Indo-Fijians would be represented equally in the House of Representatives, with 22 seats each; a further 8 seats would be set aside for Europeans and other minorities. About half of the representatives from each ethnic group would be elected only by members of their particular race, while the other half would be elected by universal suffrage. Following this agreement, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Prime Minister of Fiji: 1970 to 1992==\nWith independence, the office of Chief Minister was renamed Prime Minister, but its functions were substantially unchanged. Mara retained power in [[1972 Fijian general election|the first post-independence election]] of 1972. Internal divisions within the ethnic Fijian electorate led to the narrow defeat of his Alliance Party by the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) in the [[March 1977 Fijian general election|election of March 1977]]. He tendered his resignation as Prime Minister, but the NFP splintered three days later in a leadership dispute, and a [[1977 Fijian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] developed. The official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] [[George Cakobau|Ratu Sir George Cakobau]], ended up calling on Mara to form a new government. Although unquestionably constitutional, the Governor-General's actions were controversial. Many Indo-Fijians were outraged at what they saw as a deliberate cynical move on his part to keep the government of Ratu Mara, his fellow-chief (and distant cousin) in power at all costs. A [[September 1977 Fijian general election|subsequent election]] to resolve the impasse in September that year, however, appeared to vindicate Cakobau, when the Alliance Party won a record 36 seats out of 52.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Alliance Party's majority was reduced in the [[1982 Fijian general election|1982 election]], but with 28 of the 52 seats, Mara retained power. Despite the loss of eight seats, the popular vote for the Alliance Party rose to 51.8% \u2013 an all-time record. Part of the reason for this paradox lay in the distribution of the vote: the gains in the popular vote occurred mostly because of a swing of almost 10% in the 11 \"communal\" seats reserved for, and elected exclusively by, Indo-Fijians, but 24% of the Indo-Fijian vote was insufficient to translate into parliamentary seats, and therefore did not effectively offset small but very significant losses in ethnic Fijian \"communal\" seats. It was therefore a bittersweet election for Mara.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nConvinced of the need to include Indo-Fijians in the government, he proposed a \"government of national unity\" \u2013 a grand coalition with the National Federation Party. The NFP, however, rejected the offer and remained in opposition. In the [[1987 Fijian general election|election of 1987]], Mara was finally defeated by a multiracial coalition led by Dr [[Timoci Bavadra]]. His retirement was to be short-lived, however. [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|Two military coups]] led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka seriously undermined the social and economic stability, and the international prestige, of Fiji. Mara was recalled to head an interim administration, with a view to restoring Fiji's international reputation and rebuilding the country's shattered economy. In 1992, he handed over power to an elected government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== President of the Republic: 1993 to 2000 ==\n\n{{main|Removal of Ratu Mara, 2000}}\n\nAfter the military coups of 1987, Fiji had severed its links with the [[Monarchy of Fiji|Monarchy]] and become a republic, with a president and two [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-Presidents]] chosen by the Great Council of Chiefs. Following his retirement as Prime Minister, Mara was elected to the Vice-Presidency in June 1992, and became Acting president soon after, when the ailing president Ratu Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]] was incapacitated. He assumed the office of President officially when Ganilau died on 16 December of the following year. Modelled on the [[Monarchy of Fiji|Monarchy]], the presidency filled a largely honorary role, but was nevertheless vested with important [[reserve powers]], to be used only in the event of a national crisis. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThat crisis came on 19 May 2000, with the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|Fiji coup of 2000]]. Gunmen led by [[George Speight]] forced their way into [[House of Representatives of Fiji|Parliament]] and kidnapped the Prime Minister, [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], several Cabinet ministers, and a number of parliamentarians. Speight declared himself Prime Minister, and ordered Mara to step aside as president. Mara refused to negotiate with the plotters, and decided instead to dismiss the kidnapped government and assume emergency powers himself. His move backfired, however.  In what politicians called \"a coup within a coup,\" Ratu Mara was whisked away on the naval ship [[Kiro (ship)|Kiro]] on 28 May, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers and ordered to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, ''(\"If the Constitution goes, I go,\"'' he defiantly declared) the group, including the army commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], former Prime Minister and 1987 Coup Leader Sitiveni Rabuka, former military commander [[Epeli Ganilau|Ratu Epeli Ganilau]] (a son-in-law of Mara's), and a former Police Commissioner [[Isikia Savua]], are alleged to have asked for, and possibly forced, Mara's resignation. He was subsequently taken to his home island of [[Lakeba]] in the Lau Islands. For the 80-year-old president, who was seen as the father of the country and had led it, in one capacity or another, for more than 40 years, it was an anticlimactic end.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe military regime that took over appointed Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who had been Mara's vice-president, to succeed him on 13 July 2000. After the coup had been quashed, the [[Supreme Court of Fiji|Supreme Court]] ruled on 15 November that year that Mara's replacement was unconstitutional and ordered his reinstatement, but Mara, wishing to spare the country further constitutional trauma, officially resigned, with his resignation retroactive to 29 May 2000.\n\nOn 29 April 2001, Mara publicly accused the police chief, Colonel Isikia Savua and former Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, of instigating the coup. In what was to be his last public interview, Mara claimed that George Speight \u2013 who was then in custody and has since been convicted of treason \u2013 was only a front, Mara told [[Close-Up television program (Fiji)|Close-Up]] on [[Fiji Television]] that he confronted Savua and Rabuka two days after the coup about their possible involvement. \"''I could see it in their faces,''\" said Mara, emphatically rejecting their denials.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight's forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned [[Government House (Fiji)|Government House]] (the official residence of the president) to offer to form a government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara said that he was shocked to learn that the [[Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit]] of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Army]] had been involved in the coup. He alleged that they took George Speight to Parliament, and that their senior officers supplied them with weapons, blankets, and food. Mara also declared that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare officers who joined Speight's coup had trained on a farm owned by Rabuka. Excerpts of this interview were broadcast on 29 April 2001; the full interview was not broadcast until 29 April 2004 \u2013 while his body was lying in state in preparation for his funeral.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhether Mara's resignation was in fact forced has been the subject of a police investigation since 21 May 2003, when the [[Police Investigations Department (Fiji)|Police Investigations Department]] confirmed that they had opened an investigation into the events surrounding his departure from office. Mahendra Chaudhry, the deposed Prime Minister, has publicly supported Mara's version of events, and has further alleged that Mara was blackmailed with a threat to kill his daughter, Tourism Minister Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was one of the hostages. Commodore Bainimarama has defended his role in the incident saying it was \"necessary\" at the time, and that Mara's resignation was, in fact, voluntary and that he had refused offers of reinstatement. Mara's daughter, Adi Ateca Ganilau (wife of Ratu Epeli Ganilau) appeared to support Bainimarama's claims in a statement on 10 January 2005, saying that her father had resigned and had refused to return because he was upset by the abrogation of the Constitution. ''\"He did not agree with the abrogation of the Constitution. That was probably why he refused to return to office. It was not that the military pressured him to move out,\"'' Ganilau said. She called for a thorough investigation into the abrogation of the Constitution, and for those who were legal advisers at the time to be answerable for their actions.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nPolice have said they have faced \"many challenges\" in their investigation, finding many officers uncooperative. On 30 April 2004, the Fijian police said they were closely examining the recording of Mara's last interview, in an attempt to uncover new leads. Police spokesman [[Mesake Koroi]] declared that there was a lot of hearsay and rumours in circulation that would not stand up in a court of law. \"Unfortunately we are hitting a brick wall in our investigations at the moment,\" Koroi said. On 2 May 2005, however, Commodore Bainimarama agreed to make a statement to the police about his own role in Mara's resignation. [[Law enforcement in Fiji|Police Commissioner]] [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]] said that no charges could be brought against Commodore Bainimarama unless it could be proved that he had actually forced the president to resign.  On 5 January 2006, Hughes said that Mara's departure from the Presidency was one of seven major cases the police were still working on.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Evaluation==\nRatu Mara is regarded as modern Fiji's founding father. He not only led the islands to independence from British rule, and served the country for many years thereafter, but accumulated impressive achievements in office. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Fiji's economic growth was extraordinary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sugarcane industry===\nUnder Mara's leadership, Fiji became a giant in [[sugarcane]] production. Between 1970 and 1987, the sugarcane crop more than doubled, from under 250,000 tonnes to 502,000. The sugar industry continues to be the mainstay of Fiji's economy, and more than 90% of Fiji's sugar is exported. Mara's government led the way in negotiating special preferential marketing agreements with nations importing Fijian sugar, through the [[Lome Convention]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Pine industry===\nMara also founded Fiji's [[pine]] industry. Today, pine plantations, virtually nonexistent 40 years ago, cover close to 480 square kilometres throughout the Fiji Islands, and there is an ongoing programme to further expand area in all parts of the country. Fiji now derives more than $40 to 50 million a year in foreign exchange earnings from its forestry sector. Of this total, more than half is from pinewood chips exports. This industry now provides a substantial and increasing source of income to those in rural areas, including especially the indigenous Fijian landowners.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===International achievements and honours===\n\nIn the 1960s, Mara led a revolt by Pacific Islands delegates that brought about a restructuring of the [[South Pacific Commission]]. He also helped to launch the [[Pacific Islands Producers' Association]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum]], both associations of Pacific nations, of which Fiji was a founder member.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nYet another significant Mara achievement was his contribution to the negotiations that led to the signing of a new [[United Nations International Law of the Sea Convention]] in 1982.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOn the global stage, Mara was known for his strongly pro-American views. He supported visits to Fijian ports by nuclear-armed United States warships and submarines. He was a close ally of US President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Mara was also known for his support for [[Taiwan]]. Although he did not officially recognise the [[Republic of China]], he never hid the fact that his true sympathies lay there, and the [[Taipei]] regime, in gratitude, helped to finance the publication of his memoirs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOver the years, Mara received many honours from around the world. In addition to his knighthood (a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE), awarded in 1969), his honours from Queen Elizabeth II included the [[Meritorious Service Decoration]], the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1961), Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1983), Chancellor of the [[Order of Fiji]], Companion of the Order of Fiji, and [[Pian Order|Knight Grand Cross of the Pian Order with Star]] (1995). He was also a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in London beginning in 1973. Recognitions from other governments included being made a [[Order of the National Lion|Grand Master of the Order of the National Lion]] in [[Dakar]], Senegal in 1975, and the [[Order of Diplomatic Service Merit]] of [[South Korea]] in 1978. He was also a [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Knight of the Most Venerable Order of St John]], and became Chancellor of the [[University of the South Pacific]] at Suva, which was founded with the support of his government. In 2000, ''[[Island Business]]'' Magazine named him [[Pacific Man of the Century]], in recognition of his pivotal role in the founding of the South Pacific Forum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Criticisms===\nThere were criticisms of his leadership, too, some of which he eventually acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] system. Mara defended his role in the post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was doing the best he could in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that it had seemed better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community for his role in the drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara's reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coup, surprised many in 1999 when he claimed in an autobiography that he had carried out the coups at Mara's behest. Mara retaliated by suing him for defamation. Mahendra Chaudhry said that he did not believe that Mara had been involved.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nNot all of Mara's critics were Indo-Fijian. George Speight, a commoner (i.e., one of non-chiefly ancestry) who led the 2000 putsch accused Mara of selling the country out to Indo-Fijians, and of working to keep power in the hands of a coalition of Fijian chiefs and Indo-Fijian businessmen, at the expense of Fijian commoners.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Twilight years==\nFollowing his resignation, Mara retired to his native island of Lakeba. He continued to influence politics in Fiji, where democracy was subsequently restored, through his membership of the Great Council of Chiefs, which not only advised the government but also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to choose the President of the Republic, as well as 14 of the 32 members of the Senate; at the time of his death, he was the longest-serving member of the Council. He remained Chairman of the Lau Provincial Council, a position he had held concurrently with his national offices for many years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara suffered a [[apoplexy|stroke]] late in 2001 while visiting [[Port Vila]], Vanuatu, with two of his longtime friends, businessmen [[Hari Punja]] and [[Joe Ruggiero]]. He died in Suva on 18 April 2004, from complications arising from the stroke. His state funeral, led by Roman Catholic [[Archbishop]] [[Petero Mataca]], which was spread out over three days (28 to 30 April) saw an estimated 200,000 people \u2013 almost a quarter of Fiji's total population \u2013 line the streets to pay their last respects to the man they regarded as the father of the nation, in an outpouring of public grief not seen since the death of Mara's presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, over a decade earlier.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nEven in death, Ratu Mara stirred controversy. His state funeral was by no means universally popular, even among his close supporters. Claiming to speak for many of those who had been close to the late president, [[Joseph Browne (civil servant)|Joseph Browne]], who had been his official secretary, claimed that it was the \"height of hypocrisy\" to have the armed forces, still commanded by the same officers who had unceremoniously deposed Mara from the presidency four years earlier, honouring him at his funeral now.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA one-year period of mourning for the late Chief ended on 13 May 2005, with the close of a series of ceremonies that started on the 9th. Those who had been observing mourning rituals symbolically changed from black clothes into their normal attire. (Members of the Mara family, however, said that they would continue to wear black for a further three months, until the period of mourning for his wife, Adi Lala, is over). Thousands of people arrived in the chiefly village of [[Tubou]] on the island of Lakeba to take part in the ''vakataraisulu'' ritual, which lifted taboos in place for the Mara family and the people of the Lau Islands. Mara's son, Ratu Finau Mara, who is widely expected to be named his successor as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, was expected to participate in the ''vakataraisulu'' at the request of elders from Tubou and [[Levuka]], but for undisclosed reasons, remained in Suva. In 2004, he had attended his father's state funeral in Suva but not his private funeral in Lakeba. His younger brother, [[Roko Tevita Uluilakeba]], was believed to be out of the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAddressing the Lau Provincial Council in Ratu Mara's honour, Fiji's current vice-president, [[Joni Madraiwiwi|Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi]] praised him as a man of vision and compassion, who hated lies and lived by the truth. He praised him as a committed Christian who practised what he preached, and who did not differentiate between people but treated all men alike whatever their race or religion. Madraiwiwi called on all Lauans to follow Mara's example.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAnother controversy was reported by the [[Fiji Times]] on 8 January 2006.  His family was displeased, his daughter Adi Ateca Ganilau told the ''Times,'' that the same government that was working to release from prison persons convicted of offences related to the coup which deposed him, was also promoting an independent biography to be written by Australian academic [[Derrick Scarr]], formerly of the [[Australian National University]].  This was contradictory, she said.  ''\"On one hand they want to praise him but on the other they are working to free those people who ousted him through the [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation Bill]],\"'' she said, referring to controversial legislation introduced by the Fijian government in 2005, aimed at establishing a Commission empowered to propose amnesty for coup-convicts.  She reiterated her previously stated opposition to the release of coup-perpetrators, saying that he father would not have stood for it if he were alive.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Jioji Kotobalavu]], the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister's Department, rejected the criticism, saying that the government was not financing the book and that its involvement was limited to ensuring that Scarr had access to information sources.  He considered that co-operation in the writing of the biography would be a fitting tribute to Ratu Mara, whom he called a great man.  The Mara family should discuss any reservations with Scarr himself, Kotobalavu said.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Cricket ==\nMara played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for [[Fiji national cricket team|Fiji]] against [[Otago Volts|Otago]] and [[Canterbury Wizards|Canterbury]] in Fiji's 1953/54 tour of [[New Zealand]]. After scoring 44 runs against Canterbury he [[Broken arm|broke his arm]], curtailing both his tour, in which he served as vice-captain, and first-class career.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn his two first-class matches Mara scored 64 runs at a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 21.33, with a high score of 44. A right-arm [[Fast bowling|fast-medium]] bowler, with the ball he took 8 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 17.12, with best figures of 4/77.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara also played 8 non-first-class matches for Fiji from 1954 to 1956, with his final match for Fiji coming against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in Fiji's famous 28 run win over them, a match in which he [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] Fiji to victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMara's interests included [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], golf, athletics, and fishing. Mara is cousins with one of Fiji's famous cricketer's, [[I.L. Bula]]. He was a member of the [[Achilles Club]] in London, the [[Defence Club]] in Suva, and the [[United Oxford and Cambridge Universities Club]] in the United Kingdom. Mara's character was described as a combination of the forthright and the diplomatic, the inflexible and the dexterous, the imperious and the tolerant. He was known as a strong, imposing personality, but with an ability to forgive his opponents. A convert to Catholicism, Mara wrote of his faith: ''\"Certainly it has been the rock on which I have been able to rely in good times and in bad, and it is the lodestone of my life.\"'' He wrote an autobiography, ''[[The Pacific Way: A Memoir]].'' Mara was survived by his wife, Adi Lala (who herself died on 20 July the same year), and by two sons and five daughters; one son predeceased him.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef| before= None (new office)}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Chief Minister of Fiji]] | years=1967\u20131970}}\n{{s-aft| after=Himself<br /><small>As Prime Minister</small>}}\n{{s-bef| before= Himself<br /><small>As Chief Minister</small>}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Prime Minister of Fiji]] | years=1970\u20131987}}\n{{s-aft| after=Himself<br /><small>[[Timoci Bavadra]]</small>}}\n{{s-bef| before=[[Harish Sharms]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]] | years=1987}}\n{{s-aft| after=Vacant}}\n{{s-bef| before=Vacant}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Prime Minister of Fiji]] | years=1987\u20131992}}\n{{s-aft| after=[[Sitiveni Rabuka]]}}\n{{s-bef| before=[[Josaia Tavaiqia|Ratu Sir Josaia Tavaiqia]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Vice-President of Fiji|First Vice-President of Fiji]]\u2020| years=1992\u20131993}}\n{{s-aft| after= [[Josaia Tavaiqia|Ratu Sir Josaia Tavaiqia]]}}\n{{s-bef| before=[[Penaia Ganilau|Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=<small>Acting</small><br />[[President of Fiji]] | years=1993\u20131994}}\n{{s-aft| after=Himself<br /><small>As substantive President</small>}}\n{{s-bef| before= Himself<br /><small>As Acting President</small>}}\n{{s-ttl| title=<small>Acting</small><br />[[President of Fiji]] | years=1994\u20132000}}\n{{s-aft| after=[[Frank Bainimarama]]<br /><small>Head of the Interim Military Government</small>}}\n\n{{s-bef| before=}}\n{{s-ttl| title=Chairman of the [[Lau Provincial Council]] | years=?-2004}}\n{{s-aft| after=[[Josefa Basulu|Ratu Josefa Basulu]]}}\n{{s-reg|other}}\n{{s-bef| before=[[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Tui Lau]] | years=1964\u20132004}}\n{{s-aft| after=Vacant}}\n{{s-bef| before=[[Tevita Uluilakeba|Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba]]}}\n{{s-ttl| title=[[Tui Nayau]] | years=1969\u20132004}}\n{{s-aft| after=Vacant}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n*\u2020In Mara's time, the office of Vice-President was held simultaneously by two individuals; Mara's tenure coincided with that of [[Josaia Tavaiqia|Ratu Sir Josaia Tavaiqia]] (1992 to 1997). Tavaiqia was already First Vice-President, serving alongside [[Inoke Takiveikata]] as Second Vice-President; Takiveikata resigned in Mara's favour, and Tavaiqia moved to the post of Second Vice-President to allow Mara to assume that of First Vice-President.\n\n{{Presidents of Fiji}}\n{{Prime Ministers of Fiji}}\n{{Wikiquotepar|Kamisese Mara}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elenoa Mara-Rasova]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*'''The World of Talk on a Fijian Island''': An Ethnography of Law and Communicative Causation \u2013 Chapter 1 Pages 8,9 / Chapter 4, Page 56 By Andrew Arno Copyright 1993 by Alex Publishing, printed in the USA\n*'''The Years of Hope''': Cambridge, Colonial Administration in the South Seas and Cricket Chapter 5 Page 103 \u2013104 By Phillip A.

George|GCMG]], [[Order of British Empire|KBE]] (6 May 1920 \u2013 18 April 2004) was a Fijian politician, who served as [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] from 1967 to 1970, when Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom, and, apart from one brief interruption in 1987, the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|first Prime Minister]] from 1970 to 1992. He subsequently served as [[President of Fiji|President]] from 1993 to 2000. He is considered the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the modern nation of Fiji.\n\n==Early life and education: 1920 to 1950==\n'''Ratu Sir Kamisese Kapaiwai Tuimacilai Uluilakeba Mara''' was born on 6 May 1920, in Sawana, Lomaloma, Vanuabalavu in the archipelago of [[Lau Islands|Lau]], the son of [[Tevita Uluilakeba III|Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba]], Tui Nayau and head of the chiefly [[Vuanirewa]] clan of Tubou, Lakeba and [[Lusiana Qolikoro]] from the Fonolahi Family of the Yavusa Tonga clan in Sawana. Fonolahi has lineage to the Tongan royalty and was also descended from an English missionary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara's title, ''Ratu'', which means \"Chief,\" was hereditary; as the hereditary Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, he held the titles of ''[[Tui Lau]]'' in 1963, and ''[[Tui Nayau|Tui Nayau kei Sau ni Vanua ko Lau]]'' in 1969. He succeeded to the ''Tui Nayau'' title in 1969, following the death of his father in 1966. He was earlier installed as ''Tui Lau'' in 1963 following the traditional consultation process between the Yavusa Tonga in Sawana, Lomaloma and the Tui Nayau his father. Though the title Tui Lau is not hereditary it has been left vacant by his cousin\u00b9 [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], who had died in 1958.'''{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara was educated first at Marist Brothers' Primary School (Fiji) before he left for his final year in [[Marist Brothers High School, Fiji|Marist Brothers High School, Suva]] and [[Sacred Heart College, Auckland]]. He then attended the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, where he studied medicine (1942 to 1945). He never finished his medical studies, because his great-uncle and mentor, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (who was then regarded as Fiji's paramount chief), seeking to groom him for future leadership of the nation, arranged for him to study history at [[Wadham College, Oxford]] in the United Kingdom. Mara was distressed to abandon his medical studies, but, dependent on Ratu Sukuna for financial support, followed his orders without question, and graduated with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1949. In 1961, he returned to the United Kingdom to pursue postgraduate study at the [[London School of Economics]] for a Diploma in Economics and Social Administration, which he was awarded in 1962. In 1973, his old alma mater, Otago University, awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws ([[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFollowing his graduation from Oxford University, Mara returned to Fiji and had married [[Lala Mara|Ro Litia Cakobau Lalabalavu Katoafutoga Tuisawau]], better known as Ro Lady Lala Mara, on 9 September 1950. Her title, ''[[Ro (title)|Ro]]'', is also hereditary and is held by [[Rewa Province|Rewan]] chiefs; like her husband, Ro Lala was a chief in her own right, as the ''[[Roko Tui Dreketi]]'' (Paramount Chief) of [[Burebasaga]] and [[Rewa Province|Rewa]]. The marriage was initially opposed by some members of Mara's family, as Ro Lala was from a rival dynasty with which the [[Vuanirewa|Mara clan]] had a history of strained relations. The marriage proved to be a happy one, however, and in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce among many of Mara's relatives, it lasted for more than 53 years. They had three sons and five daughters, two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, was a [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet Minister]] and [[House of Representatives of Fiji|parliamentary]] leader of the [[Fijian Association Party]] from 1996 to 1998, when he resigned to take up a diplomatic posting. Their second daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, has also followed in her father's footsteps and has served her country as a career diplomat and politician. She was [[Minister for Transport (Fiji)|Minister for Transport]] and [[Minister for Tourism (Fiji)|Tourism]] in 1999 and 2000, and served in the [[Senate of Fiji|Fijian Senate]] from 2001 to 2006.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==The making of a statesman: 1950 to 1970==\nAfter serving (from 1950) as an Administrative Officer in the Colonial Services, Mara was nominated to one of five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] reserved for ethnic Fijians in 1953. (There were ten other seats, five reserved for Indians and five for Europeans and other minorities; a further sixteen members were appointed by the colonial Governor). In 1959, Mara was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]], and in 1963 was given responsibility as Leader of Government Business and Member for Natural Resources (officially an advisor to the Governor, but in reality roughly equivalent to a modern [[minister (government)|cabinet minister]]). In 1964, he was received into the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], which at that time was empowered to appoint two members to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]]. In 1966, he founded the Alliance Party, which, supported overwhelmingly by the ethnic Fijian and European communities (but not by most [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]]), won a majority of the seats in the 1966 [[1966 Fijian general election|election]]. In preparation for independence, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Westminster System|Westminster (Cabinet) system]] of government to Fiji in October 1967. The Executive Council was transformed into a modern Cabinet, and its members, who had hitherto been answerable only to the colonial [[Governor of Fiji|Governor]], were made fully responsible to the [[Parliament of Fiji|legislature]]. Mara was named to the new position of Chief Minister.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOne problem that threatened to delay independence was the failure of [[Fijians|ethnic Fijians]] and Indo-Fijians to agree on a post-independence [[1970 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]]. Ethnic Fijians, including Mara, wanted a communal franchise, with parliamentary seats reserved for the different ethnic groups, who would vote on separate electoral rolls. It was believed that this would protect indigenous Fijian rights. Mara also considered that it was in Fiji's interests to avoid direct competition between political candidates from different ethnic groups, fearing that it would lead to social and political upheaval. Most Indo-Fijians rejected this proposal, believing that it would prevent them from obtaining a legislative majority, even though they numbered more than half of the population, and demanded that all Parliamentary seats should be elected by universal suffrage from a common voters' roll. In April 1970, Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], leader of the mainly Indo-Fijian [[National Federation Party]], met in London and negotiated a compromise. Fijians and Indo-Fijians would be represented equally in the House of Representatives, with 22 seats each; a further 8 seats would be set aside for Europeans and other minorities. About half of the representatives from each ethnic group would be elected only by members of their particular race, while the other half would be elected by universal suffrage. Following this agreement, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Prime Minister of Fiji: 1970 to 1992==\nWith independence, the office of Chief Minister was renamed Prime Minister, but its functions were substantially unchanged. Mara retained power in [[1972 Fijian general election|the first post-independence election]] of 1972. Internal divisions within the ethnic Fijian electorate led to the narrow defeat of his Alliance Party by the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) in the [[March 1977 Fijian general election|election of March 1977]]. He tendered his resignation as Prime Minister, but the NFP splintered three days later in a leadership dispute, and a [[1977 Fijian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] developed. The official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] [[George Cakobau|Ratu Sir George Cakobau]], ended up calling on Mara to form a new government. Although unquestionably constitutional, the Governor-General's actions were controversial. Many Indo-Fijians were outraged at what they saw as a deliberate cynical move on his part to keep the government of Ratu Mara, his fellow-chief (and distant cousin) in power at all costs. A [[September 1977 Fijian general election|subsequent election]] to resolve the impasse in September that year, however, appeared to vindicate Cakobau, when the Alliance Party won a record 36 seats out of 52.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Alliance Party's majority was reduced in the [[1982 Fijian general election|1982 election]], but with 28 of the 52 seats, Mara retained power. Despite the loss of eight seats, the popular vote for the Alliance Party rose to 51.8% \u2013 an all-time record. Part of the reason for this paradox lay in the distribution of the vote: the gains in the popular vote occurred mostly because of a swing of almost 10% in the 11 \"communal\" seats reserved for, and elected exclusively by, Indo-Fijians, but 24% of the Indo-Fijian vote was insufficient to translate into parliamentary seats, and therefore did not effectively offset small but very significant losses in ethnic Fijian \"communal\" seats. It was therefore a bittersweet election for Mara.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nConvinced of the need to include Indo-Fijians in the government, he proposed a \"government of national unity\" \u2013 a grand coalition with the National Federation Party. The NFP, however, rejected the offer and remained in opposition. In the [[1987 Fijian general election|election of 1987]], Mara was finally defeated by a multiracial coalition led by Dr [[Timoci Bavadra]]. His retirement was to be short-lived, however. [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|Two military coups]] led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka seriously undermined the social and economic stability, and the international prestige, of Fiji. Mara was recalled to head an interim administration, with a view to restoring Fiji's international reputation and rebuilding the country's shattered economy. In 1992, he handed over power to an elected government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== President of the Republic: 1993 to 2000 ==\n\n{{main|Removal of Ratu Mara, 2000}}\n\nAfter the military coups of 1987, Fiji had severed its links with the [[Monarchy of Fiji|Monarchy]] and become a republic, with a president and two [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-Presidents]] chosen by the Great Council of Chiefs. Following his retirement as Prime Minister, Mara was elected to the Vice-Presidency in June 1992, and became Acting president soon after, when the ailing president Ratu Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]] was incapacitated. He assumed the office of President officially when Ganilau died on 16 December of the following year. Modelled on the [[Monarchy of Fiji|Monarchy]], the presidency filled a largely honorary role, but was nevertheless vested with important [[reserve powers]], to be used only in the event of a national crisis. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThat crisis came on 19 May 2000, with the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|Fiji coup of 2000]]. Gunmen led by [[George Speight]] forced their way into [[House of Representatives of Fiji|Parliament]] and kidnapped the Prime Minister, [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], several Cabinet ministers, and a number of parliamentarians. Speight declared himself Prime Minister, and ordered Mara to step aside as president. Mara refused to negotiate with the plotters, and decided instead to dismiss the kidnapped government and assume emergency powers himself. His move backfired, however.  In what politicians called \"a coup within a coup,\" Ratu Mara was whisked away on the naval ship [[Kiro (ship)|Kiro]] on 28 May, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers and ordered to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, ''(\"If the Constitution goes, I go,\"'' he defiantly declared) the group, including the army commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], former Prime Minister and 1987 Coup Leader Sitiveni Rabuka, former military commander [[Epeli Ganilau|Ratu Epeli Ganilau]] (a son-in-law of Mara's), and a former Police Commissioner [[Isikia Savua]], are alleged to have asked for, and possibly forced, Mara's resignation. He was subsequently taken to his home island of [[Lakeba]] in the Lau Islands. For the 80-year-old president, who was seen as the father of the country and had led it, in one capacity or another, for more than 40 years, it was an anticlimactic end.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe military regime that took over appointed Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who had been Mara's vice-president, to succeed him on 13 July 2000. After the coup had been quashed, the [[Supreme Court of Fiji|Supreme Court]] ruled on 15 November that year that Mara's replacement was unconstitutional and ordered his reinstatement, but Mara, wishing to spare the country further constitutional trauma, officially resigned, with his resignation retroactive to 29 May 2000.\n\nOn 29 April 2001, Mara publicly accused the police chief, Colonel Isikia Savua and former Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, of instigating the coup. In what was to be his last public interview, Mara claimed that George Speight \u2013 who was then in custody and has since been convicted of treason \u2013 was only a front, Mara told [[Close-Up television program (Fiji)|Close-Up]] on [[Fiji Television]] that he confronted Savua and Rabuka two days after the coup about their possible involvement. \"''I could see it in their faces,''\" said Mara, emphatically rejecting their denials.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight's forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned [[Government House (Fiji)|Government House]] (the official residence of the president) to offer to form a government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara said that he was shocked to learn that the [[Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit]] of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Army]] had been involved in the coup. He alleged that they took George Speight to Parliament, and that their senior officers supplied them with weapons, blankets, and food. Mara also declared that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare officers who joined Speight's coup had trained on a farm owned by Rabuka. Excerpts of this interview were broadcast on 29 April 2001; the full interview was not broadcast until 29 April 2004 \u2013 while his body was lying in state in preparation for his funeral.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhether Mara's resignation was in fact forced has been the subject of a police investigation since 21 May 2003, when the [[Police Investigations Department (Fiji)|Police Investigations Department]] confirmed that they had opened an investigation into the events surrounding his departure from office. Mahendra Chaudhry, the deposed Prime Minister, has publicly supported Mara's version of events, and has further alleged that Mara was blackmailed with a threat to kill his daughter, Tourism Minister Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was one of the hostages. Commodore Bainimarama has defended his role in the incident saying it was \"necessary\" at the time, and that Mara's resignation was, in fact, voluntary and that he had refused offers of reinstatement. Mara's daughter, Adi Ateca Ganilau (wife of Ratu Epeli Ganilau) appeared to support Bainimarama's claims in a statement on 10 January 2005, saying that her father had resigned and had refused to return because he was upset by the abrogation of the Constitution. ''\"He did not agree with the abrogation of the Constitution. That was probably why he refused to return to office. It was not that the military pressured him to move out,\"'' Ganilau said. She called for a thorough investigation into the abrogation of the Constitution, and for those who were legal advisers at the time to be answerable for their actions.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nPolice have said they have faced \"many challenges\" in their investigation, finding many officers uncooperative. On 30 April 2004, the Fijian police said they were closely examining the recording of Mara's last interview, in an attempt to uncover new leads. Police spokesman [[Mesake Koroi]] declared that there was a lot of hearsay and rumours in circulation that would not stand up in a court of law. \"Unfortunately we are hitting a brick wall in our investigations at the moment,\" Koroi said. On 2 May 2005, however, Commodore Bainimarama agreed to make a statement to the police about his own role in Mara's resignation. [[Law enforcement in Fiji|Police Commissioner]] [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]] said that no charges could be brought against Commodore Bainimarama unless it could be proved that he had actually forced the president to resign.  On 5 January 2006, Hughes said that Mara's departure from the Presidency was one of seven major cases the police were still working on.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Evaluation==\nRatu Mara is regarded as modern Fiji's founding father. He not only led the islands to independence from British rule, and served the country for many years thereafter, but accumulated impressive achievements in office. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Fiji's economic growth was extraordinary.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sugarcane industry===\nUnder Mara's leadership, Fiji became a giant in [[sugarcane]] production. Between 1970 and 1987, the sugarcane crop more than doubled, from under 250,000 tonnes to 502,000. The sugar industry continues to be the mainstay of Fiji's economy, and more than 90% of Fiji's sugar is exported. Mara's government led the way in negotiating special preferential marketing agreements with nations importing Fijian sugar, through the [[Lome Convention]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Pine industry===\nMara also founded Fiji's [[pine]] industry. Today, pine plantations, virtually nonexistent 40 years ago, cover close to 480 square kilometres throughout the Fiji Islands, and there is an ongoing programme to further expand area in all parts of the country. Fiji now derives more than $40 to 50 million a year in foreign exchange earnings from its forestry sector. Of this total, more than half is from pinewood chips exports. This industry now provides a substantial and increasing source of income to those in rural areas, including especially the indigenous Fijian landowners.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===International achievements and honours===\n\nIn the 1960s, Mara led a revolt by Pacific Islands delegates that brought about a restructuring of the [[South Pacific Commission]]. He also helped to launch the [[Pacific Islands Producers' Association]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum]], both associations of Pacific nations, of which Fiji was a founder member.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nYet another significant Mara achievement was his contribution to the negotiations that led to the signing of a new [[United Nations International Law of the Sea Convention]] in 1982.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOn the global stage, Mara was known for his strongly pro-American views. He supported visits to Fijian ports by nuclear-armed United States warships and submarines. He was a close ally of US President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Mara was also known for his support for [[Taiwan]]. Although he did not officially recognise the [[Republic of China]], he never hid the fact that his true sympathies lay there, and the [[Taipei]] regime, in gratitude, helped to finance the publication of his memoirs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOver the years, Mara received many honours from around the world. In addition to his knighthood (a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE), awarded in 1969), his honours from Queen Elizabeth II included the [[Meritorious Service Decoration]], the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1961), Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1983), Chancellor of the [[Order of Fiji]], Companion of the Order of Fiji, and [[Pian Order|Knight Grand Cross of the Pian Order with Star]] (1995). He was also a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in London beginning in 1973. Recognitions from other governments included being made a [[Order of the National Lion|Grand Master of the Order of the National Lion]] in [[Dakar]], Senegal in 1975, and the [[Order of Diplomatic Service Merit]] of [[South Korea]] in 1978. He was also a [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Knight of the Most Venerable Order of St John]], and became Chancellor of the [[University of the South Pacific]] at Suva, which was founded with the support of his government. In 2000, ''[[Island Business]]'' Magazine named him [[Pacific Man of the Century]], in recognition of his pivotal role in the founding of the South Pacific Forum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Criticisms===\nThere were criticisms of his leadership, too, some of which he eventually acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] system. Mara defended his role in the post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was doing the best he could in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that it had seemed better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community for his role in the drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara's reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nSitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coup, surprised many in 1999 when he claimed in an autobiography that he had carried out the coups at Mara's behest. Mara retaliated by suing him for defamation. Mahendra Chaudhry said that he did not believe that Mara had been involved.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nNot all of Mara's critics were Indo-Fijian. George Speight, a commoner (i.e., one of non-chiefly ancestry) who led the 2000 putsch accused Mara of selling the country out to Indo-Fijians, and of working to keep power in the hands of a coalition of Fijian chiefs and Indo-Fijian businessmen, at the expense of Fijian commoners.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Twilight years==\nFollowing his resignation, Mara retired to his native island of Lakeba. He continued to influence politics in Fiji, where democracy was subsequently restored, through his membership of the Great Council of Chiefs, which not only advised the government but also functioned as an [[electoral college]] to choose the President of the Republic, as well as 14 of the 32 members of the Senate; at the time of his death, he was the longest-serving member of the Council. He remained Chairman of the Lau Provincial Council, a position he had held concurrently with his national offices for many years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara suffered a [[apoplexy|stroke]] late in 2001 while visiting [[Port Vila]], Vanuatu, with two of his longtime friends, businessmen [[Hari Punja]] and [[Joe Ruggiero]]. He died in Suva on 18 April 2004, from complications arising from the stroke. His state funeral, led by Roman Catholic [[Archbishop]] [[Petero Mataca]], which was spread out over three days (28 to 30 April) saw an estimated 200,000 people \u2013 almost a quarter of Fiji's total population \u2013 line the streets to pay their last respects to the man they regarded as the father of the nation, in an outpouring of public grief not seen since the death of Mara's presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, over a decade earlier.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nEven in death, Ratu Mara stirred controversy. His state funeral was by no means universally popular, even among his close supporters. Claiming to speak for many of those who had been close to the late president, [[Joseph Browne (civil servant)|Joseph Browne]], who had been his official secretary, claimed that it was the \"height of hypocrisy\" to have the armed forces, still commanded by the same officers who had unceremoniously deposed Mara from the presidency four years earlier, honouring him at his funeral now.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA one-year period of mourning for the late Chief ended on 13 May 2005, with the close of a series of ceremonies that started on the 9th. Those who had been observing mourning rituals symbolically changed from black clothes into their normal attire. (Members of the Mara family, however, said that they would continue to wear black for a further three months, until the period of mourning for his wife, Adi Lala, is over). Thousands of people arrived in the chiefly village of [[Tubou]] on the island of Lakeba to take part in the ''vakataraisulu'' ritual, which lifted taboos in place for the Mara family and the people of the Lau Islands. Mara's son, Ratu Finau Mara, who is widely expected to be named his successor as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, was expected to participate in the ''vakataraisulu'' at the request of elders from Tubou and [[Levuka]], but for undisclosed reasons, remained in Suva. In 2004, he had attended his father's state funeral in Suva but not his private funeral in Lakeba. His younger brother, [[Roko Tevita Uluilakeba]], was believed to be out of the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAddressing the Lau Provincial Council in Ratu Mara's honour, Fiji's current vice-president, [[Joni Madraiwiwi|Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi]] praised him as a man of vision and compassion, who hated lies and lived by the truth. He praised him as a committed Christian who practised what he preached, and who did not differentiate between people but treated all men alike whatever their race or religion. Madraiwiwi called on all Lauans to follow Mara's example.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAnother controversy was reported by the [[Fiji Times]] on 8 January 2006.  His family was displeased, his daughter Adi Ateca Ganilau told the ''Times,'' that the same government that was working to release from prison persons convicted of offences related to the coup which deposed him, was also promoting an independent biography to be written by Australian academic [[Derrick Scarr]], formerly of the [[Australian National University]].  This was contradictory, she said.  ''\"On one hand they want to praise him but on the other they are working to free those people who ousted him through the [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation Bill]],\"'' she said, referring to controversial legislation introduced by the Fijian government in 2005, aimed at establishing a Commission empowered to propose amnesty for coup-convicts.  She reiterated her previously stated opposition to the release of coup-perpetrators, saying that he father would not have stood for it if he were alive.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Jioji Kotobalavu]], the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister's Department, rejected the criticism, saying that the government was not financing the book and that its involvement was limited to ensuring that Scarr had access to information sources.  He considered that co-operation in the writing of the biography would be a fitting tribute to Ratu Mara, whom he called a great man.  The Mara family should discuss any reservations with Scarr himself, Kotobalavu said.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Cricket ==\nMara played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for [[Fiji national cricket team|Fiji]] against [[Otago Volts|Otago]] and [[Canterbury Wizards|Canterbury]] in Fiji's 1953/54 tour of [[New Zealand]]. After scoring 44 runs against Canterbury he [[Broken arm|broke his arm]], curtailing both his tour, in which he served as vice-captain, and first-class career.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn his two first-class matches Mara scored 64 runs at a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 21.33, with a high score of 44. A right-arm [[Fast bowling|fast-medium]] bowler, with the ball he took 8 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 17.12, with best figures of 4/77.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMara also played 8 non-first-class matches for Fiji from 1954 to 1956, with his final match for Fiji coming against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in Fiji's famous 28 run win over them, a match in which he [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] Fiji to victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMara's interests included [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], golf, athletics, and fishing. Mara is cousins with one of Fiji's famous cricketer's, [[I.L. Bula]]. He was a member of the [[Achilles Club]] in London, the [[Defence Club]] in Suva, and the [[United Oxford and Cambridge Universities Club]] in the United Kingdom. Mara's character was described as a combination of the forthright and the diplomatic, the inflexible and the dexterous, the imperious and the tolerant. He was known as a strong, imposing personality, but with an ability to forgive his opponents. A convert to Catholicism, Mara wrote of his faith: ''\"Certainly it has been the rock on which I have been able to rely in good times and in bad, and it is the lodestone of my life.\"'' He wrote an autobiography, ''[[The Pacific Way: A Memoir]].''

The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the [[empty set]] is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]\n::<math>\\binom{0}{0} = \\frac{0!}{0!0!} = 1. </math>\n: More generally, the number of ways to choose all {{mvar|n}} elements among a set of {{mvar|n}} is\n::<math>\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1. </math>\n* It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the [[exponential function]], as a power series:\n:: <math> e^x = \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}.</math>\n* It extends the recurrence relation to 0.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough the factorial function has its roots in [[combinatorics]], formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.\n* There are {{math|''n''!}} different ways of arranging {{mvar|n}} distinct objects into a sequence, the [[permutation]]s of those objects.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond Infinity: An expedition to the outer limits of the mathematical universe |last=Cheng |first=Eugenia |date=2017-03-09 |publisher=Profile Books |isbn=9781782830818 |language=en |author-link=Eugenia Cheng}}</ref><ref name=\"ConwayGuy1998\">{{Cite book |title=The Book of Numbers |last=Conway |first=John H. |last2=Guy |first2=Richard |date=1998-03-16 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9780387979939 |language=en |author-link=John Horton Conway |author-link2=Richard K.

It looks approximately [[linear function|linear]] for all reasonable values of {{mvar|n}}, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for {{math|ln ''n''!}} by bounding the sum with an [[integral]] from above and below as follows:\n\n:<math> \\int_1^n \\ln x \\, dx \\leq \\sum_{x=1}^n \\ln x \\leq \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) \\, dx</math>\n\nwhich gives us the estimate\n\n:<math> n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)+1 \\leq \\ln n! \\leq (n+1)\\ln\\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right) + 1 \\,.</math>\n\nHence {{math|ln ''n''! \u223c ''n'' ln ''n''}} (see [[Big O notation#Family of Bachmann\u2013Landau notations|Big {{mvar|O}} notation]]). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of [[sorting algorithm]]s (see [[comparison sort]]). From the bounds on {{math|ln ''n''!}} deduced above we get that\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac ne\\right)^n e \\leq n! \\leq \\left(\\frac{n+1}e\\right)^{n+1} e \\,.</math>\n\nIt is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all {{mvar|n}} we have {{math|({{sfrac|''n''|3}})<sup>''n''</sup> < ''n''!}}, and for all {{math|''n'' \u2265 6}} we have {{math|''n''! < ({{sfrac|''n''|2}})<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\n[[File:Mplwp factorial gamma stirling.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial]]\nFor large {{mvar|n}} we get a better estimate for the number {{math|''n''!}} using [[Stirling's approximation]]:\n\n:<math>n!\\sim\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\,.</math>\n\nThis in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and {{mvar|n}} factorial lies between this and the next approximation:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n<n!<\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^ne^{1/(12n)} \\,.</math>\n\nAnother approximation for {{math|ln ''n''!}} is given by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] {{harv|Ramanujan|1988}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln n! &\\approx n\\ln n - n + \\frac {\\ln\\Bigl(n\\bigl(1+4n(1+2n)\\bigr)\\Bigr)}{6} + \\frac {\\ln\\pi}{2} \\\\[6px]\n\\Longrightarrow \\; n!&\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\left(1 +\\frac 1{2n} +\\frac 1{8n^2}\\right)^{1/6} \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBoth this and Stirling's approximation give a relative error on the order of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''<sup>3</sup>}}}}, but Ramanujan's is about four times more accurate. However, if we use ''two'' correction terms in a Stirling-type approximation, as with Ramanujan's approximation, the relative error will be of order {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''<sup>5</sup>}}}}:{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n:<math>n!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\exp\\left({\\frac 1{12n}-\\frac 1{360n^3}}\\right) \\,.</math>\n\n==Computation==\nIf efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to {{mvar|n}} (if any) will compute {{math|''n''!}}, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.\n\nThe main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow.

Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the [[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]] states that the gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation {{math|\u0393(''n'' + 1) {{=}} ''n''\u0393(''n'')}}, is [[meromorphic]] on the complex numbers, and is [[log-convex]] on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the pi function as well, using the {{math|\u03a0(''n'') {{=}} ''n''\u03a0(''n'' \u2212 1)}} functional equation.\n\nHowever, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.

The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the [[empty set]] is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]\n::<math>\\binom{0}{0} = \\frac{0!}{0!0!} = 1. </math>\n: More generally, the number of ways to choose all {{mvar|n}} elements among a set of {{mvar|n}} is\n::<math>\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1. </math>\n* It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the [[exponential function]], as a power series:\n:: <math> e^x = \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}.</math>\n* It extends the recurrence relation to 0.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough the factorial function has its roots in [[combinatorics]], formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.\n* There are {{math|''n''!}} different ways of arranging {{mvar|n}} distinct objects into a sequence, the [[permutation]]s of those objects.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond Infinity: An expedition to the outer limits of the mathematical universe |last=Cheng |first=Eugenia |date=2017-03-09 |publisher=Profile Books |isbn=9781782830818 |language=en |author-link=Eugenia Cheng}}</ref><ref name=\"ConwayGuy1998\">{{Cite book |title=The Book of Numbers |last=Conway |first=John H. |last2=Guy |first2=Richard |date=1998-03-16 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9780387979939 |language=en |author-link=John Horton Conway |author-link2=Richard K.

It looks approximately [[linear function|linear]] for all reasonable values of {{mvar|n}}, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for {{math|ln ''n''!}} by bounding the sum with an [[integral]] from above and below as follows:\n\n:<math> \\int_1^n \\ln x \\, dx \\leq \\sum_{x=1}^n \\ln x \\leq \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) \\, dx</math>\n\nwhich gives us the estimate\n\n:<math> n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)+1 \\leq \\ln n! \\leq (n+1)\\ln\\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right) + 1 \\,.</math>\n\nHence {{math|ln ''n''! \u223c ''n'' ln ''n''}} (see [[Big O notation#Family of Bachmann\u2013Landau notations|Big {{mvar|O}} notation]]). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of [[sorting algorithm]]s (see [[comparison sort]]).

Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all {{mvar|n}} we have {{math|({{sfrac|''n''|3}})<sup>''n''</sup> < ''n''!}}, and for all {{math|''n'' \u2265 6}} we have {{math|''n''! < ({{sfrac|''n''|2}})<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\n[[File:Mplwp factorial gamma stirling.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial]]\nFor large {{mvar|n}} we get a better estimate for the number {{math|''n''!}} using [[Stirling's approximation]]:\n\n:<math>n!\\sim\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\,.</math>\n\nThis in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and {{mvar|n}} factorial lies between this and the next approximation:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n<n!<\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^ne^{1/(12n)} \\,.</math>\n\nAnother approximation for {{math|ln ''n''!}} is given by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] {{harv|Ramanujan|1988}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln n! &\\approx n\\ln n - n + \\frac {\\ln\\Bigl(n\\bigl(1+4n(1+2n)\\bigr)\\Bigr)}{6} + \\frac {\\ln\\pi}{2} \\\\[6px]\n\\Longrightarrow \\; n!&\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\left(1 +\\frac 1{2n} +\\frac 1{8n^2}\\right)^{1/6} \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBoth this and Stirling's approximation give a relative error on the order of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''<sup>3</sup>}}}}, but Ramanujan's is about four times more accurate. However, if we use ''two'' correction terms in a Stirling-type approximation, as with Ramanujan's approximation, the relative error will be of order {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''<sup>5</sup>}}}}:{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n:<math>n!\\approx\\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n\\exp\\left({\\frac 1{12n}-\\frac 1{360n^3}}\\right) \\,.</math>\n\n==Computation==\nIf efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to {{mvar|n}} (if any) will compute {{math|''n''!}}, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.\n\nThe main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in [[personal computer]]s, however many languages support variable length integer types capable of calculating very large values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial|title=wesselbosman/nFactorial|author=|date=2017-12-25|website=GitHub|access-date=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426001413/https://github.com/wesselbosman/nFactorial|archive-date=26 April 2018|df=}}</ref> [[Floating-point]] representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most [[calculator]]s use [[scientific notation]] with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because {{nowrap|69! < 10<sup>100</sup> < 70!}}.  Other implementations (such as computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.\n\nMost software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using [[Stirling's formula]]. [[Wolfram Alpha]] can calculate exact results for the [[ceiling function]] and [[floor function]] applied to the [[binary logarithm|binary]], [[natural logarithm|natural]] and [[common logarithm]] of {{math|''n''!}} for values of {{mvar|n}} up to {{val|249999}}, and up to {{val|20000000|end=!}} for the integers.\n\nIf the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]]. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications {{nowrap|((1 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 3) \u00d7 4...}}, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a [[divide-and-conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]] method.

Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the [[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]] states that the gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation {{math|\u0393(''n'' + 1) {{=}} ''n''\u0393(''n'')}}, is [[meromorphic]] on the complex numbers, and is [[log-convex]] on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the pi function as well, using the {{math|\u03a0(''n'') {{=}} ''n''\u03a0(''n'' \u2212 1)}} functional equation.\n\nHowever, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.

So the superfactorial of 4 is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{sf}(4)=1! \\times 2! \\times 3! \\times 4!=288\\,. </math>\n\nIn general\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{sf}(n) =\\prod_{k=1}^n k! &=\\prod_{k=1}^n k^{n-k+1}\\\\\n & =1^n\\cdot2^{n-1}\\cdot3^{n-2}\\cdots(n-1)^2\\cdot n^1\\,.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nEquivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula\n:<math> \\operatorname{sf}(n) =\\prod_{0 \\le i < j \\le n} (j-i) </math>\nwhich is the [[determinant]] of a [[Vandermonde matrix]].\n\nThe sequence of superfactorials starts (from {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}) as\n\n:1, 1, 2, 12, 288, {{val|34560}}, {{val|24883200}}, {{val|125411328000}},... {{OEIS|id=A000178}}\n\nBy this definition, we can define the {{mvar|k}}-superfactorial of {{mvar|n}} (denoted {{math|sf<sub>''k''</sub>(''n'')}}) as:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{sf}_k(n) = \\begin{cases}\nn & \\text{if } k=0\\\\\n\\prod_{r=1}^n \\operatorname{sf}_{k-1}(r) & \\text{if } k \\ge 1\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe 2-superfactorials of {{mvar|n}} are\n\n:1, 1, 2, 24, {{val|6912|fmt=gaps}}, {{val|238878720}}, {{val|5944066965504000}}, {{val|745453331864786829312000000}},... {{OEIS|id=A055462}}\n\nThe 0-superfactorial of {{mvar|n}} is {{mvar|n}}.\n\n====Pickover\u2019s superfactorial====\nIn his 1995 book ''Keys to Infinity'', [[Clifford Pickover]] defined a different function {{math|''n''$}} that he called the superfactorial.  It is defined by\n:<math>n\\$\\equiv \\begin{matrix} \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} \\\\ n! \\mbox{ copies of } n! \\end{matrix}. </math>\nThis sequence of superfactorials starts\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n1\\$&=1\\,,\\\\\n2\\$&=2^2=4\\,,\\\\\n3\\$&=6^{6^{6^{6^{6^6}}}}\\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n(Here, as is usual for compound [[exponentiation]], the grouping is understood to be from right to left: {{math|''a<sup>b<sup>c</sup></sup>'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>(''b<sup>c</sup>'')</sup>}}.)\n\nThis operation may also be expressed as the [[tetration]] \n:<math>n\\$={}^{n!}(n!)\\,,</math>\nor using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] as\n:<math>n\\$=(n!)\\uparrow\\uparrow(n!) = (n!)\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow2\\,. </math>\n\n===Hyperfactorial===\nOccasionally the '''hyperfactorial''' of ''n'' is considered. It is written as {{math|''H''(''n'')}} and defined by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nH(n)  &=\\prod_{k=1}^n k^k \\\\\n& =1^1\\cdot2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdots(n-1)^{n-1}\\cdot n^n.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nFor {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, 4,...}} the values of {{math|''H''(''n'')}} are 1, 4, 108, {{val|27648}},... {{OEIS|id=A002109}}.\n\nThe asymptotic growth rate is\n\n:  <math>H(n) \\sim A n^{(6n^2 + 6n + 1)/12} e^{-n^2/4}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|A}} = 1.2824... is the [[Glaisher\u2013Kinkelin constant]].<ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=Glaisher-KinkelinConstant | title=Glaisher\u2013Kinkelin Constant}}</ref> {{math|''H''(14)}} \u2248&nbsp;{{val|1.8474e99}} is already almost equal to a [[googol]], and {{math|''H''(15)}} \u2248&nbsp;{{val|8.0896e116}} is almost of the same magnitude as the [[Shannon number]], the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.\n\nThe hyperfactorial function can be generalized to [[complex number]]s in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the [[K-function|{{mvar|K}}-function]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arithmetic|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternating factorial]]\n* [[Bhargava factorial]]\n* [[Digamma function]]\n* [[Exponential factorial]]\n* [[Factorial number system]]\n* [[Factorion]]\n* [[List of factorial and binomial topics]]\n* [[Pochhammer symbol]], which gives the falling or rising factorial\n* [[Subfactorial]]\n* [[Trailing zeros#Factorial|Trailing zeros]] of factorial\n* [[Triangular number]], the additive analogue of factorial\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation |last=Bostock |first=Linda |title=Further Pure Mathematics |date=2014-11-01 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |language=en |isbn=9780859501033 |last2=Chandler |first2=Suzanne |author2-link= Sue Chandler |last3=Rourke |first3=C.}}\n*{{citation|first1=Ronald L.|last1=Graham|author1-link= Ronald Graham |first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth|first3=Oren|last3=Patashnik|author3-link=Oren Patashnik|date=1988|title=Concrete Mathematics|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA|isbn=0-201-14236-8|title-link=Concrete Mathematics}}\n*{{Citation |last=Guy |first=Richard K. |title=Unsolved problems in number theory |url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=1AP2CEGxTkgC}} |year=2004 |contribution=E24 Irrationality sequences |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=0-387-20860-7 |zbl=1058.11001 |author-link=Richard K.
