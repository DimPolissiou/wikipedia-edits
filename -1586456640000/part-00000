After spending two nights at the residence of Jogendra Majumdar, on 9 November he embarked on his tour of Noakhali, barefoot. In the next seven weeks he covered 116 miles and visited 47 villages. He set up his base in a half-burnt house in the village of Srirampur, where he stayed until 1 January. He organised prayer meetings, met local Muslim leaders and tried to win their confidence. Mistrust between Hindus and Muslims continued to exist, and stray incidents of violence occurred even during his stay in Noakhali. On the evening of 10 November, two persons were reported to have been murdered while returning home after attending Gandhi's evening prayer at Duttapara relief camp.<ref>{{cite press release |title= |publisher=Government of Bengal |date=13 November 1946}}</ref>\n\nGandhi's stay in Noakhali was resented by the Muslim leadership.

The first batches of refugees arrived in Kolkata after the massacres and forced conversions. The refugee flow subsided when the Government announced relief measures and the relief organisations started working in Noakhali and Tippera. However, in March 1947, when the Congress agreed to the Partition of India, the relief camps were abandoned and a fresh refugee influx took place in [[Tripura]], Assam and the region that was to become [[West Bengal]]. Around 50,000 Hindu refugees who were sheltered in temporary relief camps were subsequently relocated to [[Guwahati]] in Assam.<ref name=\"pg17092013\">{{cite book|last=Ghosh|first=Partha S.|year=2013|title=Refugees and Migrants in South Asia: Nature and implications|publisher=Nehru Memorial Museum and Library|url=http://www.sasnet.lu.se/sites/default/files/refugees.pdf|isbn=81-87614-70-6|accessdate=17 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610213806/http://www.sasnet.lu.se/sites/default/files/refugees.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAccording to historian Rakesh Batabyal, the situation never returned to normal.<ref name=\"rb276\">{{cite book |last=Batabyal |first=Rakesh |date=2005 |title=Communalism in Bengal: From Famine to Noakhali, 1943\u201347 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Sage Publications |page=276 |isbn=0-7619-3335-2 |quote=The situation never returned to normal ...

The latter had initially agreed to provide him with a copy. However, the Governor and the secretaries strongly objected to such a proposition and Suhrawardy declined to hand over the report to Gandhi. A copy of the report was with Mathur, the secretary to Suhrawardy, who secretly provided a summary to ''The Statesman''. The editor published a censored version on 13 November 1946.

His report was covered up by the government. After arriving at Kolkata, on his way to Noakhali, Gandhi sought a copy of the report from Prime Minister Suhrawardy. The latter had initially agreed to provide him with a copy. However, the Governor and the secretaries strongly objected to such a proposition and Suhrawardy declined to hand over the report to Gandhi. A copy of the report was with Mathur, the secretary to Suhrawardy, who secretly provided a summary to ''The Statesman''. The editor published a censored version on 13 November 1946. In the report, Simpson mentioned that for a proper investigation into the happenings in Noakhali, at least 50 senior officers would need to be engaged for a period of six months.<ref name=\"rcm421\">{{cite book |title=\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0987\u09a4\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09b8 |language=Bengali |trans-title=History of Bangla Desh |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |authorlink=Ramesh Chandra Majumdar |volume=4 |year=1975 |publisher=General Printers and Publishers |location=Kolkata |page=421}}</ref>\n\n=== Noakhali on the eve of Partition ===\nThough the massacres and mass conversions had stopped in October, persecution of the Hindu population continued in Noakhali, even during Gandhi's stay there.

He did his schooling at [[Otoor]], [[Junnar]] and [[Pune]] in [[Maharashtra]]\n\n==Career==\nShankar Vaidya was a Marathi poet popularly known for his easy flowing poems, many of which express timeless qualities. He was also known for his deep study of poetry covering Marathi poets going back to the 19th century and even earlier to 13th century poets like Sant (Saint) [[Dnyaneshwar]]. His ability to carry on an entertaining poetry recitation completely from memory, and covering this vast span of literature, made him a popular figure at various literary events. His first collection of poems (Kavya Sangrah) \u2018Kalaswar\u2019 (rough translation: Melody of Time) was published in 1971. However, his first book \u2018Aala Kshan Gela Kshan\u2019 (rough translation: Impending instants in time, instants passed by in time) was a collection of short stories published in the early 1960s. Despite being a prolific writer, his second collection of poems 'Darshan' (rough translation: vision) was published only after a long interval in 1998. Many of his poems were published in various periodicals, especially the specials published during the festival of [[Diwali]] but were never collected in anthologies.\n\nHe was honoured with many prestigious awards like the Maharashtra Shasan award, Konkan Marathi Sahitya Parishad award, Master Dinanath Pratisthan award and many more.<ref>[http://www.marathisanmaan.com/news-articles/marathi-poet-shankar-vaidya-passed-away Marathi Poet Shankar Vaidya]</ref><ref>[http://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-senior-marathi-poet-shankar-vaidya-passes-away-at-86-4754077-NOR.html Shankar Vaidya]</ref>\n\nA number of songs written by Shankar Vaidya became very popular, with \"Swargangechya Kathavarti\" (sung by [[Arun Date]]) leading the list.

He died on 23 September 2014 in Mumbai. He was poet, writer, teacher, speaker and announcer. He used to be called \"Sir\", both out of respect and due to his background as an educator.\n\n==Birth and education==\nHe was born on 15 June 1928 in [[Otoor]], [[Pune District]] in [[Maharashtra]]. He did his schooling at [[Otoor]], [[Junnar]] and [[Pune]] in [[Maharashtra]]\n\n==Career==\nShankar Vaidya was a Marathi poet popularly known for his easy flowing poems, many of which express timeless qualities. He was also known for his deep study of poetry covering Marathi poets going back to the 19th century and even earlier to 13th century poets like Sant (Saint) [[Dnyaneshwar]]. His ability to carry on an entertaining poetry recitation completely from memory, and covering this vast span of literature, made him a popular figure at various literary events. His first collection of poems (Kavya Sangrah) \u2018Kalaswar\u2019 (rough translation: Melody of Time) was published in 1971. However, his first book \u2018Aala Kshan Gela Kshan\u2019 (rough translation: Impending instants in time, instants passed by in time) was a collection of short stories published in the early 1960s. Despite being a prolific writer, his second collection of poems 'Darshan' (rough translation: vision) was published only after a long interval in 1998. Many of his poems were published in various periodicals, especially the specials published during the festival of [[Diwali]] but were never collected in anthologies.\n\nHe was honoured with many prestigious awards like the Maharashtra Shasan award, Konkan Marathi Sahitya Parishad award, Master Dinanath Pratisthan award and many more.<ref>[http://www.marathisanmaan.com/news-articles/marathi-poet-shankar-vaidya-passed-away Marathi Poet Shankar Vaidya]</ref><ref>[http://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-senior-marathi-poet-shankar-vaidya-passes-away-at-86-4754077-NOR.html Shankar Vaidya]</ref>\n\nA number of songs written by Shankar Vaidya became very popular, with \"Swargangechya Kathavarti\" (sung by [[Arun Date]]) leading the list. Other well known songs include, \"Shatakanchya Yadnyatuna Uthali Ek Keshari Jwala\" (sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]]) and \"Valawantatuna Chalale Jeevan\" (sung by [[Yashwant Deo]]).

Both forms were developed in the 1980s.\n\nEurobeat is directly related to the Japanese [[Para Para]] dance culture as it influences many song and business decisions. In the United States, Eurobeat was historically marketed as Hi-NRG and for a short while shared this term with early [[Latin freestyle|freestyle music]] and Italo disco.\n\n==Characteristics==\n;SAW-style\nA highly polished production with \"musical simplicity\" at its core; from bubblegum pop-like lyrics, catchy (in some cases Italian, in other Eurodisco-like) melodies, to \"elementary\" song structures, an average British Eurobeat song took very little time to complete.<ref name=BMI/> \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)#Bananarama version|Venus]]\" by Bananarama and Mel & Kim's \"[[Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)]]\", according to Waterman of SAW, were completed in a day.<ref name=BMI/> \n\n;Classic Eurobeat-style\n{{listen\n|pos=right\n | filename = Speedway by Niko, from Super Eurobeat Vol. 101.ogg\n | title = \"Speedway\"\n | description = ''Beginning''(0:00-0:31) \u2192 ''riff'' in [[Maurizio De Jorio|Niko]]'s \"Speedway\", from ''[[Super Eurobeat|Super Eurobeat Vol. 101]]''\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n{{listen\n|pos=right\n | filename     = Boom Boom Fire by D.Essex, from Super Eurobeat Vol. 140.ogg\n | title        = \"Boom Boom Fire\"\n | description  = ''[[Megamix]]-beginning'' \u2192 ''riff'' [then cut to] ''b melo'' \u2192 ''sabi'' \u2192 ''riff'' in [[Maurizio De Jorio|D.Essex]]'s \"Boom Boom Fire\", from ''[[Super Eurobeat|Super Eurobeat Vol. 140]]''\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nEither variant is not recognized primarily by the complexity of its lyrics.

Many European acts managed to break through under this new recognition, namely the likes of [[Modern Talking]], [[Bad Boys Blue]], [[Taffy (singer)|Taffy]], and [[Spagna]]. The term \"Eurobeat\" was subsequently used commercially to describe the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]\u2013produced hits by [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], [[Bananarama]], [[Jason Donovan]], [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] which were heavily based on the British experience with Italo disco. During 1986\u20131988 it was used for specific Italian 1980s [[Euro disco]] imports, such as [[Sabrina Salerno]], [[Spagna]], and [[Baltimora]] but was also used in the [[United States]] as a catch-all term for UK-based [[dance music|dance]] and [[electropop]] groups of the time such as [[Pet Shop Boys]], purported to have a \"European beat\", hence Eurobeat. By 1989, with the advent of [[Eurodance]] and Euro house, the term was dropped in the UK.\n\n==History==\n===United Kingdom===\n====\"The New Motown\"====\n{{quote box|quote=\"It's a great hybrid with Motown-style lyrics, an Italian-style melody, and a Eurobeat.

As underground record producers, they sought to recapture the \"nostalgia\" of Motown Sound with a hint of campy playfulness where simplicity of musical structures, like in Italian disco, was preferred. This musical formula was proven to be successful enough to be capitalized on as they had a string of top 10 UK hits in the 1980s to the point of their version of Eurobeat becoming synonymous with British pop music as a whole.<ref>Manning, Sean (2008). \"Rock and Roll Cage Match: Music's Greatest Rivalries, Decided\".

For instance, there was a lyric from 'Something in My House' [from the follow-up album, ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know''] where I make a reference to a 'wicked queen.' The actual producer, Mike Stock, stopped me and said I couldn't use the term because it would mean the record is about gay people. I was like, 'Fuck this; it's going on!'

These were mainly Italian and German-produced [[Italo disco]] releases. That sound became the soundtrack of the [[Para Para]] nightclub culture, that has existed since the early 1980s. Japan experienced Italo disco through the success of the German group [[Arabesque (group)|Arabesque]], which broke up in 1984. This did not prevent the release of two Italo disco-sounding singles in 1985 and 1986, produced and mixed by [[Michael Cretu]] (of [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]]). The later solo success of Arabesque's lead singer [[Sandra Cretu|Sandra]] further introduced this sound to Japan. This attracted the attention of many Italo disco producers (mostly Italians and Germans) and by the late 80s while the Germans faded out of the outdated Italo disco scene and went for other newly rising popular scenes, mainly [[Trance music|trance]], the Italians created a new sound especially for Japan, but virtually unknown in the rest of the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In Japan, this music is called \"Eurobeat\", \"Super Eurobeat\", and \"Eurobeat Flash\".  \n[[File:Dsc 1150 Mantua.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The majority of eurobeat labels has been based in [[Northern Italy]], including [[Lugagnano Val d'Arda|Lugagnano]], [[Brescia]] and [[Mantova]] (pictured).]]\n[[File:Velfarre floor 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Velfarre]], a discoth\u00e8que located in Tokyo, was considered a [[mecca]] of Eurobeat during the 1990s and 2000s.]]\nIn the early 1990s when Eurobeat's popularity was gradually decreasing in Japan, two Japanese men, the owner and a managing director of [[Avex Group|Avex]], a small import record shop at the time, decided to release a [[compilation CD]]. They went to Italy and met Giancarlo Pasquini later known as [[Dave Rodgers]], then a member of the Italo disco band [[Aleph (musician)|Aleph]], and eventually released the compilation CD, the first ''[[Super Eurobeat]]'', which proved an instant success and re-sparked Eurobeat's popularity in Japan.<ref>http://triplei.hp.infoseek.co.jp/s-page/eurobeat.html</ref> Avex also collaborated with foundational Eurobeat labels A-Beat C, [[Time Records|Time]], Delta long after Eurobeat's mainstream popularity peak.<ref name=Steve/>\n\nEurobeat's sound (in the Japanese market) is its main link to its Italo disco origins, where it was just one of many different experiments in pure [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]]. There are certain synth instruments that recur across the entire genre: a sequenced octave bass, characteristic are the energetic (sometimes wild) and heavy use of synths, distinctive brass and harp sounds, and tight, predictable percussion in the background.

The game acquired Eurobeat songs from the ''[[Dancemania]]'' compilation series from [[Toshiba EMI]]. Over time, DDR has featured Eurobeat songs on-and-off in their songlists. However, their number has dwindled due to efforts to make DDR more marketable to North American markets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Currently, there has been a push to add more Eurobeat into DDR, most recently with the addition of Super Eurobeat tracks in the latest arcade release, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X2]]''.

Both forms were developed in the 1980s.\n\nEurobeat is directly related to the Japanese [[Para Para]] dance culture as it influences many song and business decisions. In the United States, Eurobeat was historically marketed as Hi-NRG and for a short while shared this term with early [[Latin freestyle|freestyle music]] and Italo disco.\n\n==Characteristics==\n;SAW-style\nA highly polished production with \"musical simplicity\" at its core; from bubblegum pop-like lyrics, catchy (in some cases Italian, in other Eurodisco-like) melodies, to \"elementary\" song structures, an average British Eurobeat song took very little time to complete.<ref name=BMI/> \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)#Bananarama version|Venus]]\" by Bananarama and Mel & Kim's \"[[Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)]]\", according to Waterman of SAW, were completed in a day.<ref name=BMI/> \n\n;Classic Eurobeat-style\n{{listen\n|pos=right\n | filename = Speedway by Niko, from Super Eurobeat Vol. 101.ogg\n | title = \"Speedway\"\n | description = ''Beginning''(0:00-0:31) \u2192 ''riff'' in [[Maurizio De Jorio|Niko]]'s \"Speedway\", from ''[[Super Eurobeat|Super Eurobeat Vol. 101]]''\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n{{listen\n|pos=right\n | filename     = Boom Boom Fire by D.Essex, from Super Eurobeat Vol. 140.ogg\n | title        = \"Boom Boom Fire\"\n | description  = ''[[Megamix]]-beginning'' \u2192 ''riff'' [then cut to] ''b melo'' \u2192 ''sabi'' \u2192 ''riff'' in [[Maurizio De Jorio|D.Essex]]'s \"Boom Boom Fire\", from ''[[Super Eurobeat|Super Eurobeat Vol. 140]]''\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nEither variant is recognized not primarily by the complexity of its lyrics.

Many European acts managed to break through under this new recognition, namely the likes of [[Modern Talking]], [[Bad Boys Blue]], [[Taffy (singer)|Taffy]], and [[Spagna]]. The term \"Eurobeat\" was subsequently used commercially to describe the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]\u2013produced hits by [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], [[Bananarama]], [[Jason Donovan]], [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] which were heavily based on the British experience with Italo disco. During 1986\u20131988 it was used for specific Italian 1980s [[Euro disco]] imports, such as [[Sabrina Salerno]], [[Spagna]], and [[Baltimora]] but was also used in the [[United States]] as a catch-all term for UK-based [[dance music|dance]] and [[electropop]] groups of the time such as [[Pet Shop Boys]], purported to have a \"European beat\", hence Eurobeat. By 1989, with the advent of [[Eurodance]] and Euro house, the term was dropped in the UK.\n\n==History==\n===United Kingdom===\n====\"The New Motown\"====\n{{quote box|quote=\"It's a great hybrid with Motown-style lyrics, an Italian-style melody, and a Eurobeat.

As underground record producers, they sought to recapture the \"nostalgia\" of Motown Sound with a hint of campy playfulness where simplicity of musical structures, like in Italian disco, was preferred. This musical formula was proven to be successful enough to be capitalized on as they had a string of top 10 UK hits in the 1980s to the point of their version of Eurobeat becoming synonymous with British pop music as a whole.<ref>Manning, Sean (2008). \"Rock and Roll Cage Match: Music's Greatest Rivalries, Decided\".

These were mainly Italian and German-produced [[Italo disco]] releases. That sound became the soundtrack of the [[Para Para]] nightclub culture, that has existed since the early 1980s. Japan experienced Italo disco through the success of the German group [[Arabesque (group)|Arabesque]], which broke up in 1984. This did not prevent the release of two Italo disco-sounding singles in 1985 and 1986, produced and mixed by [[Michael Cretu]] (of [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]]). The later solo success of Arabesque's lead singer [[Sandra Cretu|Sandra]] further introduced this sound to Japan. This attracted the attention of many Italo disco producers (mostly Italians and Germans) and by the late 80s while the Germans faded out of the outdated Italo disco scene and went for other newly rising popular scenes, mainly [[Trance music|trance]], the Italians created a new sound especially for Japan, but virtually unknown in the rest of the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In Japan, this music is called \"Eurobeat\", \"Super Eurobeat\", and \"Eurobeat Flash\".  \n[[File:Dsc 1150 Mantua.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The majority of eurobeat labels has been based in [[Northern Italy]], including [[Lugagnano Val d'Arda|Lugagnano]], [[Brescia]] and [[Mantova]] (pictured).]]\n[[File:Velfarre floor 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Velfarre]], a discoth\u00e8que located in Tokyo, was considered a [[mecca]] of Eurobeat during the 1990s and 2000s.]]\nIn the early 1990s when Eurobeat's popularity was gradually decreasing in Japan, two Japanese men, the owner and a managing director of [[Avex Group|Avex]], a small import record shop at the time, decided to release a [[compilation CD]].

There are certain synth instruments that recur across the entire genre: a sequenced octave bass, characteristic are the energetic (sometimes wild) and heavy use of synths, distinctive brass and harp sounds, and tight, predictable percussion in the background.

However, their number has dwindled due to efforts to make DDR more marketable to North American markets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Currently, there has been a push to add more Eurobeat into DDR, most recently with the addition of Super Eurobeat tracks in the latest arcade release, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X2]]''.

Eurobeat songs made in Japan, and sung by Japanese artists themselves.\n:: This type of Eurobeat was always present since the 2000s, but only started recently to gain much attention with the [[para para]]  scene promoting a lot of these songs. Most songs are anime remixes or J-Pop covers, which makes it an ''anime boom'' as some people call it.{{Tone inline|date=August 2013}}\n::Eurobeat labels to showcase this type of J-Euro are ''A-One'', ''Akiba Koubou INC/Akiba Records'', ''Eurobeat Union'', ''Plum Music'', ''Fantasy Dance Tracks'' and more.\n\n===Para Para===\n{{main|Para Para}}\nOne of the dance moves Eurobeat spawned was {{nihongo|''para para''|\u30d1\u30e9\u30d1\u30e9}}, a type of Eurobeat music-inspired Japanese youth social dance performed in unison.<ref>Karen Ma (1996). \"The Modern Madame Butterfly: Fantasy and Reality in Japanese Cross-cultural Relationships\".

Artists usually adopt different stage names according to the mood of each song, or depending on who wrote their lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} For instance, Ennio Zanini has stated on the SCP Music website that he goes by the name of \"Fastway\" on songs which are more upbeat and sprinkled with high-pitched female backing vocals, and goes by \"Dusty\" on his more \"serious\" tracks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Eurobeat artists|List of artists]]\n*[[Super Eurobeat]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Music of Japan}}\n{{Hi-NRG}}\n\n[[Category:Eurobeat|*]]\n[[Category:1980s in music]]\n[[Category:1990s in music]]\n[[Category:2000s in music]]\n[[Category:Hi-NRG]]\n[[Category:British styles of music]]\n[[Category:Italian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Japanese styles of music]]\n[[Category:Okinawan music]]\n[[Category:Culture in Okinawa Prefecture]]\n", "name_user": "Ghostofakina", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacteristics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobeat"}
