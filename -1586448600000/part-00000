They brought him to the Bantay Augustiner priest who baptized him as Pedro Bucaneg. Bukaneg was blind but appeared during his upbringing in the Augustinian convent smart and talented. He took lessons in Latin and Spanish and also learned the local languages and Ilocano Isneg.\n\nThrough his knowledge of these languages he was asked by the priests in the region to translate their prayers and sermons in local languages. He was being asked to help with the conversion of the local population. Bukaneg composed poems and songs and was loved by the Ilocanos as a troubadour. He was regarded by the locals as a seer. Even the Spaniards knocked him for his services. He would have identified the killer of a servant of a Spaniard on a day in a row of Itneg men by placing his hand on the chest of all these men.\n\nHis blindness prevented him not to write. He dictated the text of his poems, songs and translations, and someone else wrote. However, much of the work of Bukaneg has been preserved. Ilocano epic Biag ni Lam-ang is attributed to Bukaneg by some authors and historians. However, it is also possible that Bukaneg wrote the text of the work that has been sung for centuries  by the Ilocano and thus preserved it for eternity. It was also Bukaneg who translated the Doctrina Cristiana  in Ilocano. This book was printed in 1593 as one of the first books in the Philippines and was intended for use in the conversion of the local population. In 1621 the Ilocano translation of Bukaneg was printed in the Augustinian Convent of Manila. Bukaneg was also largely responsible for Arte de la Lengue Iloca, the first grammar book of the Ilocano of Brother Francisco Lopez, which was printed in 1927 by the University of Santo Tomas.\n\nBukaneg died around 1630.

In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air. The company ranked 197th on the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] of the largest American corporations by revenue.<ref name=\"Fortune 500 Companies 2018\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018|publisher=fortune.com|accessdate =March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early radio years===\nThe origins of CBS date back to January 27, 1927, with the creation of the \"United Independent Broadcasters\" network in [[Chicago]] by New York City [[talent agent|talent-agent]] [[Arthur Judson]]. The fledgling network soon needed additional investors, and the Columbia Phonograph Company, manufacturers of [[Columbia Records]], rescued it in April 1927. Now the \"Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System\", the network went to air under its new name on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard L.

None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H. Grebe]]'s [[Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) for a small Brooklyn station, [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (no relation to the current [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56. The station changed frequencies again, to 880 kHz, in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)'s 1941 reassignment of stations ([[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]]); in 1946, WABC was renamed [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].</ref> The physical plant was relocated also&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Steinway Hall]] on West 57th Street in [[Manhattan]], where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.<ref name=berg/>\n\nPaley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\"<ref name=berg61/> The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.<ref name=bartow251>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 261</ref> In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=halfirst>[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1979).

There were two types of program at the time: ''sponsored'' and ''sustaining'', i.e., unsponsored. Rival [[NBC]] paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran.<ref name=bargoldfirst>{{cite book |title=The Golden Web: A History of Broadcasting in the United States, 1933\u20131953|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn|url-access=registration|author=[[Erik Barnouw]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1968|page=[https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn/page/57 57] |isbn= 978-0-19-500475-5}}</ref> It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:<ref name=halfirst/> he would ''give'' the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.<ref name=bargoldfirst/> CBS soon had more affiliates than either [[NBC Red Network|NBC Red]] or [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]].<ref>In 1943, the FCC would force NBC to sell off its Blue network, which thereupon became ABC. Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 190</ref>\n\nPaley was a man who valued style and taste,<ref name=hal26>Halberstam, pp. 26\u201327</ref> and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his concern to sleek, new 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the \"heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be\"<ref name=berg60>Bergreen, p. 60</ref> and where it would stay until its move to its own [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>\n\n====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====\n[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" frequencies.

Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245\u2013246</ref> to bring live feeds of [[Europe]]an events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was [[Edward R.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, [[game show]]s and amateur hours to wither for the duration.<ref name=bargol156/>\n\nSurprising was \"the granite permanence\" of the shows at the top of the ratings.<ref name=bargol284>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 284</ref> The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Edgar Bergen]] all had been on the radio almost as long as there had ''been'' network radio.<ref name=bargol285>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 285</ref> A notable exception to this was relative newcomer [[Arthur Godfrey]] who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=berg179>Bergreen, p. 179</ref> Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an ''individual'', with a singular \"you\" rather than phrases like \"Now, folks...\" or \"Yes, friends...\".<ref name=berg180>Bergreen, p. 180</ref> His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of ''all'' CBS revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.<ref name=berg179/>\n\nIn 1947, Paley, still the undisputed \"head talent scout\" of CBS,<ref name=berg169/> led a much-publicized \"talent raid\" on NBC. One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Shortly after ruling in favor of NBC, FCC chairman Charles Denny resigned from the FCC to become vice president and general counsel of NBC: Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 243</ref> In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3&nbsp;million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg1589>Bergreen, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> 64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had one.<ref name=bargol295>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 295</ref>\n\nRadio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in the ''early'' 1950s, but it was \"a strange, twilight period\" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities (such as Denver and Portland, Oregon) had no television stations at all.  In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole, nationally broadcast service.<ref name=bargol285/> NBC's venerable [[Fred Allen]] saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show ''Stop The Music!''; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor [[Ford Motor Company]] and was shortly gone from the scene.<ref name=bargol2878>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 287\u2013288</ref> Radio powerhouse [[Bob Hope]]'s ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.<ref name=bargol288>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 288</ref> By 1952, \"death seemed imminent for network radio\" in its familiar form;<ref name=bargol290>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 290</ref> most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.\n\nGradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'' moved to television in 1952 and would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back \"home\" from NBC, made the move in 1950; [[Lucille Ball]] a year later; ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated ''[[The Jack Benny Program|Jack Benny Program]]'' ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money,<ref name=berg230>Bergreen, p. 230</ref> it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series remained.

The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the ''[[General Mills Radio Adventure Theater]]'' and the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'' in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations.<ref name=dun143>Dunning, p. 143</ref> The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece ''CBS World News Roundup'' in the morning and evening, weekend sister program ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup]]'', the news-related feature segment ''[[Charles Osgood|The Osgood File]]'', ''What's In the News'', a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality [[Dave Ross]], tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET]].\n\n{{anchor|Big Four}}\nOn November 17, 2017 CBS Radio was sold to Entercom becoming the last of the original Big Four radio network to be owned by its founding company.<ref name=\"entercom-8k-20171116\">{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | title = Form 8-K | author = Entercom Communications Corp. | publisher = Securities and Exchange Commission | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-17 }}</ref> Although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS Radio continued to be run by CBS until its sale to Entercom.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup.  CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]] and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]]) due to NBC [[Extortion|extorting]] and [[coercion|coercing]] Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW radio]] and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for [[Cleveland]] stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89\u201390}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\n====Programming (1945\u20131970)====\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well. One reluctant CBS star refused to bring her radio show, ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', to television unless the network would recast the show with her real-life husband in the lead.\n\n''[[I Love Lucy]]'' debuted in October 1951, and was an immediate sensation, with 11&nbsp;million out of a population of 15&nbsp;million [[Television set]]s watching (73% [[Ratings share|share]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-i-love-lucy-dominated-222960 |title=How 'I Love Lucy' Dominated Ratings From Its Start |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 15, 2011 |access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little faith in the future of Lucille Ball's series, that they granted her wish and allowed her husband, [[Desi Arnaz]], to take financial control of the comedy's production.

When the [[quiz show scandals]] involving \"rigged\" questions surfaced in 1959, Cowan was fired by CBS.\n\nAs television came to the forefront of American entertainment and information, CBS dominated television as it once had radio.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} In 1953, the CBS television network would make its first profit,<ref name=\"CC\">{{cite web|title=Paley, William S|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/paleywillia.htm|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}</ref> and would maintain dominance on television between 1955 and 1976 as well.<ref name=\"CC\"/> By the late 1950s, the network often controlled seven or eight of the slots on the \"top ten\" ratings list with well-respected shows like ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nDuring the Presidency of [[James T. Aubrey]] (1958\u20131965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting the ''Tiffany Network'' image), with more [[low culture]], broad appeal programs. So the network had challenging fare like ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', and ''[[East Side/West Side]]'', as well as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', and ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|title=East Side/West Side|work=classictvhistory.com|last=Bowie|first=Stephen|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis success would continue for many years, with CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, during the late 1960s and early 1970s CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the ''[[Smothers Brothers|Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]'' (and its many spinoffs) during this period.\n\n====Programming: \"Rural purge\" and success in the 1970s and early-mid 1980s (1971\u20131986)====\n{{Main|Rural purge}}\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], but many of its shows (including ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[Green Acres]]'') were appealing more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young, urban and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. [[Fred Silverman]] (who would later head [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and then later [[NBC]]) made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the \"[[Rural Purge]]\", with ''Green Acres'' cast member [[Pat Buttram]] remarking that the network cancelled \"anything with a tree in it\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ken Berry interview|url=http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|work=KenBerry.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20000903070554/http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2000|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtehLu1cissC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203|author=Anthony Harkins|page=203|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|accessdate=March 23, 2009|isbn=0-19-518950-7}}</ref>\n\nWhile the \"rural\" shows got the axe, new hits, like ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', <!--''[[The Waltons]]'', - - - this is not a rural show? -->''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'' took their place on the network's schedule and kept CBS at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s.

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and the newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', all having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|Major League Baseball]] from [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to [[NBC]] after the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]].\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''; ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''; ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]; [[Picket Fences]]''; and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman'' during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period.<ref name=\"tvtropes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].\n\nDespite having success with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever. The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with [[Major League Baseball]] (after losing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with [[The Baseball Network|NBC and ABC]]. Then on December 17 of that year, in a move that surprised many media analysts and television viewers, Fox&nbsp;\u2013 then a fledgling network that in its then-seven years on the air had begun to accrue several popular programs in the Nielsen Top 20 alongside its established counterparts&nbsp;\u2013 outbid CBS for the broadcast rights to the [[National Football Conference]], stripping the elder network of [[National Football League]] game telecasts for the first time since CBS began broadcasting games from the pre-[[AFL-NFL merger|merger]] NFL in 1955; Fox bid $1.58&nbsp;billion for the NFC television rights, significantly higher than CBS's reported offer of $290&nbsp;million to retain the contract.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Gets Final N.F.L.

One of the shows that was affected was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''; as a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which the ''Late Show'' often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"[[CBS Block Party]]\", in the [[1997\u201398 United States network television schedule|1997\u201398 season]] (consisting of ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the latter coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were cancelled by November, while ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]]; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]].\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (stripping that package from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] after 32 years), effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998\u20131999 United States network television schedule|1998\u20131999 season]]; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.\n\n====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002\u2013present)====\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS-NFL marriage extended to Thursday nights in 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/05/cbs-thursday-tv-games-nfl-network/5227869/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn September 29, 2016, National Amusements, the owner of both CBS' parent company, CBS Corporation, and its sister company [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (owner of Paramount Pictures), sent a letter to both companies, encouraging them to merge back into one company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-amusements-calls-viacom-cbs-933705|title=National Amusements Proposes Viacom, CBS Reunion, Cites \"Substantial Synergies\"|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> On December 12, the deal was called off.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shari Redstone withdraws CBS-Viacom merger proposal|url=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/12/shari-redstone-withdraws-cbs-viacom-merger-proposal.html||newspaper=[[CNBC]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|accessdate=2016-12-17}}</ref> However, on January 12, 2018, [[CNBC]] reported that both CBS and Viacom have since re-entered talks to merge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/viacom-shares-jump-9-percent-percent-on-wrap-report-that-its-looking-to-merge-with-cbs.html|title=Viacom, CBS shares surge after report Shari Redstone pursuing merge of companies|last=Wang|first=Christine|date=2018-01-12|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref> On August 13, 2019, CEO [[Shari Redstone]] announced that Viacom and CBS have agreed to a merger, reuniting the two media giants after 14 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/business/cbs-viacom-merger.html|title=CBS and Viacom to Reunite in Victory for Shari Redstone|last=Lee|first=Edmund|date=2019-08-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe two companies have also been reported as in talks to acquire [[Lionsgate]], along with [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Verizon]], and [[Comcast]] (owner of both NBC and CNBC via its [[NBCUniversal]] division) in order to bulk up after [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox and its assets from Rupert Murdoch by The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2/|work=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> This was reported at the same time as the CBS and Viacom re-merger talks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investors.com/news/amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-lionsgate/|title=These 4 Tech, Media Giants Are In Talks To Buy Lionsgate\n|newspaper=Investor's Business Daily|accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/lionsgate-talks-amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-1202244991/|title=Lionsgate Ripe For Takeover As Amazon, Verizon and CBS-Viacom Emerge As Potential Suitors\n|newspaper=Deadline|accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref> Lionsgate Vice Chairman [[Michael R.

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first = Colin|last = Michael}}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the US trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]].

([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]]. The New World deal resulted in CBS affiliating with UHF stations in [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]]&nbsp;\u2013 former Fox affiliate [[WOIO]] and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now [[WWJ-TV]]), the latter of which was purchased by the network&nbsp;\u2013 after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WEWS-TV]] (the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) to respectively replace departing affiliates [[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]], a situation that the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; TV Stations Shift to ABC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC pre-empts CBS in Cleveland, Detroit|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-06-20.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=June 20, 1994|page=7}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Scripps deal was [[Baltimore]] NBC affiliate [[WMAR-TV]] (which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC affiliate [[WJZ-TV]], despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its [[broadcast license|license]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Smith family seeks to take Channel 2; WBFF owners' move could shift WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 13, 1991|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref> This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Group W's Negotiations|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=8|date=July 11, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with CBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Add Three Affiliates in Deal With Westinghouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|last=Carter|first=Bill| newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1994|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, Group W Form Historic Alliance|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-07-18.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=July 18, 1994|page=14}}</ref> Of the other four stations, two of the stations ([[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]) were already longtime affiliates of the network, while two others ([[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WBZ-TV]] in [[Boston]]) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995. NBC traded [[KCNC-TV]] in [[Denver]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]] to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in [[Miami]], with NBC-owned [[WTVJ]] moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as [[WFOR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, NBC changing channels.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|author=Tom Jicha|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=November 22, 1994|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn August 1, 1995, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] acquired CBS outright for $5.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Westinghouse-CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS Agrees to Buyout Bid by Westinghouse : Entertainment: $5.4-billion merger would create biggest TV, radio empire.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific (7:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) and Sunday from 7:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. (6:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain).\n\nDaytime programming is also provided between 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays (including a half-hour break for local news) featuring the game shows ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', [[soap opera]]s ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', and talk show ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]''.\n\n[[CBS News]] programming includes ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday political talk show]] ''[[Face the Nation]]'', early morning news program ''[[CBS Morning News]]''. and the newsmagazines ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', and ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include ''Match Game'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10/25,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''Family Feud'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''Password''. Two long-running prime time-only games were the panel shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nThe network is also home to ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'', a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's ''[[The View (American TV series)|The View]]'', which debuted in October 2010 ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}, the program is hosted by moderator [[Julie Chen]], series creator/executive producer [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Sheryl Underwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019|09}}, CBS Daytime airs two daytime [[soap operas]] each weekday: the hour-long series ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (debuted in 1973) and half-hour series ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (debuted in 1987). CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying 3{{frac|1|2}} hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than ''Guiding Light'', notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' and ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]''.\n\n===Children's programming===\n{{Main|Children's programming on CBS}}\nCBS broadcast the live-action series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']]. In 1997, CBS premiered ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' (a children's version of the syndicated game show ''Wheel of Fortune''), which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]].\n\nIn September 1998, CBS began contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule.

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family\u2019s Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].\n\nThe Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996.

However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in [[720p]] HD, while seven others carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nCBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, CBS HD, on September 1998 at the start of the [[1998\u201399 United States network television schedule|1998\u201399 season]]. That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]\u2013[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts. ''The Young and the Restless'' became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.<ref name=\"HDTV\">{{cite news|title=Finding the art in HDTV|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/finding-art-hdtv/97190|author=Karen Anderson Prikios|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 25, 2001|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCBS's 14-year conversion to an entirely high definition schedule ended in 2014, with ''Big Brother'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' becoming the final two network series to convert from [[4:3]] standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules&nbsp;\u2013 outside of Saturday mornings&nbsp;\u2013 in high definition by the 2010\u201311 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011\u201312 midseason). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception of certain [[Christmas holiday season|holiday]] specials produced prior to 2005&nbsp;\u2013 such as the Rankin-Bass specials&nbsp;\u2013 which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).\n\nOn September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a [[16:9]] widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks which frame their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a [[4:3]] presentation, though with CBS Sports's ''de facto'' 16:9 conversion with [[Super Bowl 50]] and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has frequently been copied or borrowed by television networks around the world. Notable examples include the Austrian Broadcasting System ([[\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]]), which formerly used a red version of the eye logo; [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom; [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru; [[Fuji Television]] in Japan; [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil; and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.

In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air. The company ranked 197th on the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] of the largest American corporations by revenue.<ref name=\"Fortune 500 Companies 2018\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018|publisher=fortune.com|accessdate =March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early radio years===\nThe origins of CBS date back to January 27, 1927, with the creation of the \"United Independent Broadcasters\" network in [[Chicago]] by New York City [[talent agent|talent-agent]] [[Arthur Judson]].

None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H. Grebe]]'s [[Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) for a small Brooklyn station, [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (no relation to the current [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56. The station changed frequencies again, to 880 kHz, in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)'s 1941 reassignment of stations ([[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]]); in 1946, WABC was renamed [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].</ref> The physical plant was relocated also&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Steinway Hall]] on West 57th Street in [[Manhattan]], where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.<ref name=berg/>\n\nPaley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\"<ref name=berg61/> The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.<ref name=bartow251>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 261</ref> In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=halfirst>[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1979).

Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:<ref name=halfirst/> he would ''give'' the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.<ref name=bargoldfirst/> CBS soon had more affiliates than either [[NBC Red Network|NBC Red]] or [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]].<ref>In 1943, the FCC would force NBC to sell off its Blue network, which thereupon became ABC. Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 190</ref>\n\nPaley was a man who valued style and taste,<ref name=hal26>Halberstam, pp. 26\u201327</ref> and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his concern to sleek, new 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the \"heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be\"<ref name=berg60>Bergreen, p. 60</ref> and where it would stay until its move to its own [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965.

Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his&nbsp;\u2013 and his affiliates'&nbsp;\u2013 success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> wrote [[David Halberstam]]. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\"<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]], (\"Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist\"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] & [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign [[Bing Crosby]] immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;\u2013 and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day.

Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245\u2013246</ref> to bring live feeds of [[Europe]]an events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was [[Edward R.

He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to [[London]] as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists&nbsp;\u2013 including [[William L.

They were \"in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\".<ref name=berg110>Bergreen, p. 110</ref> They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly [[Anschluss|annexed nearby Austria]] and Murrow and Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] in Paris, [[Pierre Huss]] in [[Berlin]], [[Frank Gervasi]] in [[Rome]] and Trout in New York.<ref name=bargol78>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 78</ref> This bore the ''[[CBS World News Roundup|News Round-Up]]'' format, which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news.\n\nMurrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] galvanized American listeners: even before [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], the conflict became \"the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories.

Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of ''faux'' news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from [[Mars]] were actually invading and devastating [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]], despite ''three'' disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on ''faux'' news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''&nbsp;\u2013 the former sustaining program became ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>\n\n====CBS recruits Edmund A.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, [[game show]]s and amateur hours to wither for the duration.<ref name=bargol156/>\n\nSurprising was \"the granite permanence\" of the shows at the top of the ratings.<ref name=bargol284>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 284</ref> The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Edgar Bergen]] all had been on the radio almost as long as there had ''been'' network radio.<ref name=bargol285>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 285</ref> A notable exception to this was relative newcomer [[Arthur Godfrey]] who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=berg179>Bergreen, p. 179</ref> Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an ''individual'', with a singular \"you\" rather than phrases like \"Now, folks...\" or \"Yes, friends...\".<ref name=berg180>Bergreen, p. 180</ref> His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of ''all'' CBS revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.<ref name=berg179/>\n\nIn 1947, Paley, still the undisputed \"head talent scout\" of CBS,<ref name=berg169/> led a much-publicized \"talent raid\" on NBC. One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Shortly after ruling in favor of NBC, FCC chairman Charles Denny resigned from the FCC to become vice president and general counsel of NBC: Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 243</ref> In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3&nbsp;million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg1589>Bergreen, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> 64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had one.<ref name=bargol295>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 295</ref>\n\nRadio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in the ''early'' 1950s, but it was \"a strange, twilight period\" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities (such as Denver and Portland, Oregon) had no television stations at all.  In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole, nationally broadcast service.<ref name=bargol285/> NBC's venerable [[Fred Allen]] saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show ''Stop The Music!''; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor [[Ford Motor Company]] and was shortly gone from the scene.<ref name=bargol2878>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 287\u2013288</ref> Radio powerhouse [[Bob Hope]]'s ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.<ref name=bargol288>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 288</ref> By 1952, \"death seemed imminent for network radio\" in its familiar form;<ref name=bargol290>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 290</ref> most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.\n\nGradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'' moved to television in 1952 and would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back \"home\" from NBC, made the move in 1950; [[Lucille Ball]] a year later; ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated ''[[The Jack Benny Program|Jack Benny Program]]'' ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money,<ref name=berg230>Bergreen, p. 230</ref> it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series remained.

The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the ''[[General Mills Radio Adventure Theater]]'' and the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'' in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations.<ref name=dun143>Dunning, p. 143</ref> The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece ''CBS World News Roundup'' in the morning and evening, weekend sister program ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup]]'', the news-related feature segment ''[[Charles Osgood|The Osgood File]]'', ''What's In the News'', a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality [[Dave Ross]], tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET]].\n\n{{anchor|Big Four}}\nOn November 17, 2017 CBS Radio was sold to Entercom becoming the last of the original Big Four radio network to be owned by its founding company.<ref name=\"entercom-8k-20171116\">{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | title = Form 8-K | author = Entercom Communications Corp. | publisher = Securities and Exchange Commission | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-17 }}</ref> Although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS Radio continued to be run by CBS until its sale to Entercom.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup.  CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]] and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]]) due to NBC [[Extortion|extorting]] and [[coercion|coercing]] Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW radio]] and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for [[Cleveland]] stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89\u201390}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\n====Programming (1945\u20131970)====\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well. One reluctant CBS star refused to bring her radio show, ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', to television unless the network would recast the show with her real-life husband in the lead.\n\n''[[I Love Lucy]]'' debuted in October 1951, and was an immediate sensation, with 11&nbsp;million out of a population of 15&nbsp;million [[Television set]]s watching (73% [[Ratings share|share]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-i-love-lucy-dominated-222960 |title=How 'I Love Lucy' Dominated Ratings From Its Start |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 15, 2011 |access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little faith in the future of Lucille Ball's series, that they granted her wish and allowed her husband, [[Desi Arnaz]], to take financial control of the comedy's production.

When the [[quiz show scandals]] involving \"rigged\" questions surfaced in 1959, Cowan was fired by CBS.\n\nAs television came to the forefront of American entertainment and information, CBS dominated television as it once had radio.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} In 1953, the CBS television network would make its first profit,<ref name=\"CC\">{{cite web|title=Paley, William S|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/paleywillia.htm|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}</ref> and would maintain dominance on television between 1955 and 1976 as well.<ref name=\"CC\"/> By the late 1950s, the network often controlled seven or eight of the slots on the \"top ten\" ratings list with well-respected shows like ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nDuring the Presidency of [[James T. Aubrey]] (1958\u20131965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting the ''Tiffany Network'' image), with more [[low culture]], broad appeal programs. So the network had challenging fare like ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', and ''[[East Side/West Side]]'', as well as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', and ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|title=East Side/West Side|work=classictvhistory.com|last=Bowie|first=Stephen|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis success would continue for many years, with CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, during the late 1960s and early 1970s CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the ''[[Smothers Brothers|Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]'' (and its many spinoffs) during this period.\n\n====Programming: \"Rural purge\" and success in the 1970s and early-mid 1980s (1971\u20131986)====\n{{Main|Rural purge}}\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], but many of its shows (including ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[Green Acres]]'') were appealing more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young, urban and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. [[Fred Silverman]] (who would later head [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and then later [[NBC]]) made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the \"[[Rural Purge]]\", with ''Green Acres'' cast member [[Pat Buttram]] remarking that the network cancelled \"anything with a tree in it\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ken Berry interview|url=http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|work=KenBerry.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20000903070554/http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2000|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtehLu1cissC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203|author=Anthony Harkins|page=203|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|accessdate=March 23, 2009|isbn=0-19-518950-7}}</ref>\n\nWhile the \"rural\" shows got the axe, new hits, like ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', <!--''[[The Waltons]]'', - - - this is not a rural show? -->''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'' took their place on the network's schedule and kept CBS at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s.

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and the newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', all having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|Major League Baseball]] from [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to [[NBC]] after the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]].\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''; ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''; ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]; [[Picket Fences]]''; and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman'' during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period.<ref name=\"tvtropes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].\n\nDespite having success with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever. The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with [[Major League Baseball]] (after losing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with [[The Baseball Network|NBC and ABC]]. Then on December 17 of that year, in a move that surprised many media analysts and television viewers, Fox&nbsp;\u2013 then a fledgling network that in its then-seven years on the air had begun to accrue several popular programs in the Nielsen Top 20 alongside its established counterparts&nbsp;\u2013 outbid CBS for the broadcast rights to the [[National Football Conference]], stripping the elder network of [[National Football League]] game telecasts for the first time since CBS began broadcasting games from the pre-[[AFL-NFL merger|merger]] NFL in 1955; Fox bid $1.58&nbsp;billion for the NFC television rights, significantly higher than CBS's reported offer of $290&nbsp;million to retain the contract.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Gets Final N.F.L.

One of the shows that was affected was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''; as a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which the ''Late Show'' often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"[[CBS Block Party]]\", in the [[1997\u201398 United States network television schedule|1997\u201398 season]] (consisting of ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the latter coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were cancelled by November, while ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]]; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]].\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (stripping that package from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] after 32 years), effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998\u20131999 United States network television schedule|1998\u20131999 season]]; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.\n\n====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002\u2013present)====\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS-NFL marriage extended to Thursday nights in 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/05/cbs-thursday-tv-games-nfl-network/5227869/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn September 29, 2016, National Amusements, the owner of both CBS' parent company, CBS Corporation, and its sister company [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (owner of Paramount Pictures), sent a letter to both companies, encouraging them to merge back into one company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-amusements-calls-viacom-cbs-933705|title=National Amusements Proposes Viacom, CBS Reunion, Cites \"Substantial Synergies\"|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> On December 12, the deal was called off.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shari Redstone withdraws CBS-Viacom merger proposal|url=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/12/shari-redstone-withdraws-cbs-viacom-merger-proposal.html||newspaper=[[CNBC]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|accessdate=2016-12-17}}</ref> However, on January 12, 2018, [[CNBC]] reported that both CBS and Viacom have since re-entered talks to merge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/viacom-shares-jump-9-percent-percent-on-wrap-report-that-its-looking-to-merge-with-cbs.html|title=Viacom, CBS shares surge after report Shari Redstone pursuing merge of companies|last=Wang|first=Christine|date=2018-01-12|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref> On August 13, 2019, CEO [[Shari Redstone]] announced that Viacom and CBS have agreed to a merger, reuniting the two media giants after 14 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/business/cbs-viacom-merger.html|title=CBS and Viacom to Reunite in Victory for Shari Redstone|last=Lee|first=Edmund|date=2019-08-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe two companies have also been reported as in talks to acquire [[Lionsgate]], along with [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Verizon]], and [[Comcast]] (owner of both NBC and CNBC via its [[NBCUniversal]] division) in order to bulk up after [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox and its assets from Rupert Murdoch by The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2/|work=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> This was reported at the same time as the CBS and Viacom re-merger talks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investors.com/news/amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-lionsgate/|title=These 4 Tech, Media Giants Are In Talks To Buy Lionsgate\n|newspaper=Investor's Business Daily|accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/lionsgate-talks-amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-1202244991/|title=Lionsgate Ripe For Takeover As Amazon, Verizon and CBS-Viacom Emerge As Potential Suitors\n|newspaper=Deadline|accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref> Lionsgate Vice Chairman [[Michael R.

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first = Colin|last = Michael}}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the US trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]].

([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]]. The New World deal resulted in CBS affiliating with UHF stations in [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]]&nbsp;\u2013 former Fox affiliate [[WOIO]] and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now [[WWJ-TV]]), the latter of which was purchased by the network&nbsp;\u2013 after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WEWS-TV]] (the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) to respectively replace departing affiliates [[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]], a situation that the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; TV Stations Shift to ABC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC pre-empts CBS in Cleveland, Detroit|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-06-20.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=June 20, 1994|page=7}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Scripps deal was [[Baltimore]] NBC affiliate [[WMAR-TV]] (which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC affiliate [[WJZ-TV]], despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its [[broadcast license|license]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Smith family seeks to take Channel 2; WBFF owners' move could shift WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 13, 1991|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref> This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Group W's Negotiations|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=8|date=July 11, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with CBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Add Three Affiliates in Deal With Westinghouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|last=Carter|first=Bill| newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1994|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, Group W Form Historic Alliance|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-07-18.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=July 18, 1994|page=14}}</ref> Of the other four stations, two of the stations ([[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]) were already longtime affiliates of the network, while two others ([[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WBZ-TV]] in [[Boston]]) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995. NBC traded [[KCNC-TV]] in [[Denver]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]] to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in [[Miami]], with NBC-owned [[WTVJ]] moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as [[WFOR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, NBC changing channels.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|author=Tom Jicha|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=November 22, 1994|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn August 1, 1995, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] acquired CBS outright for $5.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Westinghouse-CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS Agrees to Buyout Bid by Westinghouse : Entertainment: $5.4-billion merger would create biggest TV, radio empire.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week.

Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include ''Match Game'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10/25,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''Family Feud'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''Password''. Two long-running prime time-only games were the panel shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nThe network is also home to ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'', a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's ''[[The View (American TV series)|The View]]'', which debuted in October 2010 ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}, the program is hosted by moderator [[Julie Chen]], series creator/executive producer [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Sheryl Underwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019|09}}, CBS Daytime airs two daytime [[soap operas]] each weekday: the hour-long series ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (debuted in 1973) and half-hour series ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (debuted in 1987). CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying 3{{frac|1|2}} hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than ''Guiding Light'', notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' and ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]''.\n\n===Children's programming===\n{{Main|Children's programming on CBS}}\nCBS broadcast the live-action series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']]. In 1997, CBS premiered ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' (a children's version of the syndicated game show ''Wheel of Fortune''), which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]].\n\nIn September 1998, CBS began contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule.

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>https://watch.boomerang.com/movies</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].\n\nThe Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996.

However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in [[720p]] HD, while seven others carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nCBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, CBS HD, on September 1998 at the start of the [[1998\u201399 United States network television schedule|1998\u201399 season]]. That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]\u2013[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts. ''The Young and the Restless'' became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.<ref name=\"HDTV\">{{cite news|title=Finding the art in HDTV|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/finding-art-hdtv/97190|author=Karen Anderson Prikios|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 25, 2001|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCBS's 14-year conversion to an entirely high definition schedule ended in 2014, with ''Big Brother'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' becoming the final two network series to convert from [[4:3]] standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules&nbsp;\u2013 outside of Saturday mornings&nbsp;\u2013 in high definition by the 2010\u201311 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011\u201312 midseason). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception of certain [[Christmas holiday season|holiday]] specials produced prior to 2005&nbsp;\u2013 such as the Rankin-Bass specials&nbsp;\u2013 which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).\n\nOn September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a [[16:9]] widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks which frame their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a [[4:3]] presentation, though with CBS Sports's ''de facto'' 16:9 conversion with [[Super Bowl 50]] and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has frequently been copied or borrowed by television networks around the world. Notable examples include the Austrian Broadcasting System ([[\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]]), which formerly used a red version of the eye logo; [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom; [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru; [[Fuji Television]] in Japan; [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil; and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.
