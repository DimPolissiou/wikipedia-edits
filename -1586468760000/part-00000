According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Acadians that returned from exile discovered several thousand immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands.

According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

{"title_page": "Superintelligence", "text_new": "{{short description|Hypothetical immensely superhuman agent}}\n{{for2|the book by Nick Bostrom|[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|the 2019 film|[[Super Intelligence]]}}\n\nA '''superintelligence''' is a hypothetical [[intelligent agent|agent]] that possesses [[intelligence]] far surpassing that of the [[genius|brightest]] and most [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] human minds. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an [[Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion|intelligence explosion]] and associated with a [[technological singularity]].\n\n[[University of Oxford]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] defines ''superintelligence'' as \"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\".{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|loc=Chapter 2}} The program [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] falls short of superintelligence\u2014even though it is much better than humans at chess\u2014because Fritz cannot outperform humans in other tasks.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=22}} Following Hutter and Legg, Bostrom treats superintelligence as general dominance at goal-oriented behavior, leaving open whether an artificial or human superintelligence would possess capacities such as [[intentionality]] (cf. the [[Chinese room]] argument) or [[qualia|first-person consciousness]] ([[cf.]] the [[hard problem of consciousness]]).\n\nTechnological researchers disagree about how likely present-day [[human intelligence]] is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of [[futures studies]] scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to [[brain\u2013computer interface|interface with computers]], or [[mind uploading|upload their minds to computers]], in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.\n\nSome researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of [[artificial general intelligence]]. The first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of [[perfect recall]], a vastly superior knowledge base, and the ability to [[Human multitasking|multitask]] in ways not possible to biological entities. This may give them the opportunity to\u2014either as a single being or as a new [[species]]\u2014become much more powerful than humans, and to displace them.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|loc=Chapter 2}}\n\nA number of scientists and forecasters argue for prioritizing early research into the possible benefits and risks of [[Intelligence amplification|human and machine cognitive enhancement]], because of the potential social impact of such technologies.{{sfn|Legg|2008|pp=135-137}}\n\n==Feasibility of artificial superintelligence==\n[[File:Classification of images progress human.png|thumb|Progress in machine classification of images\n--------------------------\nThe error rate of AI by year. Red line - the error rate of a trained human\n]]\nPhilosopher [[David Chalmers]] argues that [[artificial general intelligence]] is a very likely path to superhuman intelligence. Chalmers breaks this claim down into an argument that AI can achieve ''equivalence'' to human intelligence, that it can be ''extended'' to surpass human intelligence, and that it can be further ''amplified'' to completely dominate humans across arbitrary tasks.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=7}}\n\nConcerning human-level equivalence, Chalmers argues that the human brain is a mechanical system, and therefore ought to be emulatable by synthetic materials.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=7-9}} He also notes that human intelligence was able to biologically evolve, making it more likely that human engineers will be able to recapitulate this invention. [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s in particular should be able to produce human-level AI.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=10-11}} Concerning intelligence extension and amplification, Chalmers argues that new AI technologies can generally be improved on, and that this is particularly likely when the invention can assist in designing new technologies.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=11-13}}\n\nIf research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself &ndash; a feature called \"recursive self-improvement\". It would then be even better at improving itself, and could continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to a superintelligence. This scenario is known as an [[intelligence explosion]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and may be able to invent or discover almost anything.\n\nComputer components already greatly surpass human performance in speed.  Bostrom writes, \"Biological neurons operate at a peak speed of about 200 Hz, a full seven orders of magnitude slower than a modern microprocessor (~2 GHz).\"{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=59}} Moreover, [[neuron]]s transmit spike signals across [[axon]]s at no greater than 120 m/s, \"whereas existing electronic processing cores can communicate optically at the speed of light\". Thus, the simplest example of a superintelligence may be an emulated human mind run on much faster hardware than the brain. A human-like reasoner that could think millions of times faster than current humans would have a dominant advantage in most reasoning tasks, particularly ones that require haste or long strings of actions.\n\nAnother advantage of computers is modularity, that is, their size or computational capacity can be increased.  A non-human (or modified human) brain could become much larger than a present-day human brain, like many [[supercomputer]]s. Bostrom also raises the possibility of ''collective superintelligence'': a large enough number of separate reasoning systems, if they communicated and coordinated well enough, could act in aggregate with far greater capabilities than any sub-agent.\n\nThere may also be ways to ''qualitatively'' improve on human reasoning and decision-making. Humans appear to differ from [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in the ways we think more than we differ in brain size or speed.<ref>{{cite techreport |first=Eliezer |last=Yudkowsky |authorlink=Eliezer Yudkowsky |title=Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics |url=http://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf |number=2013-1 |institution=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] |year=2013 |page=35}}</ref> Humans outperform non-human animals in large part because of new or enhanced reasoning capacities, such as long-term planning and [[great ape language|language use]]. (See [[evolution of human intelligence]] and [[primate cognition]].) If there are other possible improvements to reasoning that would have a similarly large impact, this makes it likelier that an agent can be built that outperforms humans in the same fashion humans outperform chimpanzees.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=56-57}}\n\nAll of the above advantages hold for artificial superintelligence, but it is not clear how many hold for biological superintelligence. Physiological constraints limit the speed and size of biological brains in many ways that are inapplicable to machine intelligence. As such, writers on superintelligence have devoted much more attention to superintelligent AI scenarios.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=52, 59-61}}\n\n==Feasibility of biological superintelligence==\n[[Carl Sagan]] suggested that the advent of [[Caesarean section]]s and [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] may permit humans to evolve larger heads, resulting in improvements via [[natural selection]] in the [[adaptive evolution in the human genome|heritable]] component of [[human intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan |date=1977 |title=The Dragons of Eden |url= |location= |publisher=Random House |isbn= |accessdate=|title-link=The Dragons of Eden }}</ref> By contrast, [[Gerald Crabtree]] has argued that decreased selection pressure is resulting in a slow, centuries-long [[Fertility and Intelligence|reduction in human intelligence]], and that this process instead is likely to continue into the future. There is no scientific consensus concerning either possibility, and in both cases the biological change would be slow, especially relative to rates of cultural change.\n\n[[Selective breeding]], [[nootropics]], [[NSI-189]], [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-I's]], [[Epigenetics|epigenetic modulation]], and [[genetic engineering]] could improve human intelligence more rapidly. Bostrom writes that if we come to understand the genetic component of intelligence, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis could be used to select for embryos with as much as 4 points of IQ gain (if one embryo is selected out of two), or with larger gains (e.g., up to 24.3 IQ points gained if one embryo is selected out of 1000). If this process is iterated over many generations, the gains could be an order of magnitude greater. Bostrom suggests that deriving new gametes from embryonic stem cells could be used to iterate the selection process very rapidly.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=37-39}} A well-organized society of high-intelligence humans of this sort could potentially achieve [[collective intelligence|collective]] superintelligence.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=39}}\n\nAlternatively, collective intelligence might be constructible by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. A number of writers have suggested that human civilization, or some aspect of it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a [[global brain]] with capacities far exceeding its component agents. If this systems-based superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components, however, it may qualify as an AI rather than as a biology-based [[superorganism]].{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=48-49}}. A [[prediction market]] is sometimes considered an example of working collective intelligence system, consisting of humans only.<ref>{{cite|title=Prediction Markets as an Aggregation Mechanism for Collective Intelligence|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mg0p0zc|year=2007|last=Watkins|first=Jennifer H.}}</ref> \n\nA final method of intelligence amplification would be to directly [[Neuroenhancement|enhance]] individual humans, as opposed to enhancing their social or reproductive dynamics. This could be achieved using [[nootropics]], somatic [[gene therapy]], or [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s. However, Bostrom expresses skepticism about the scalability of the first two approaches, and argues that designing a superintelligent [[cyborg]] interface is an [[AI-complete]] problem.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=36-37, 42, 47}}\n\n== Forecasts ==\nMost surveyed AI researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence, though there is little consensus on when this will likely happen. At the 2006 [[AI@50]] conference, 18% of attendees reported expecting machines to be able \"to simulate learning and every other aspect of human intelligence\" by 2056; 41% of attendees expected this to happen sometime after 2056; and 41% expected machines to never reach that milestone.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maker|first1=Meg Houston|title=AI@50: First Poll|url=http://www.megmaker.com/2006/07/ai50_first_poll.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513052243/http://www.megmaker.com/2006/07/ai50_first_poll.html|archivedate=2014-05-13|date=July 13, 2006}}</ref> \n\nIn a survey of the 100 most cited authors in AI (as of May 2013, according to Microsoft academic search), the median year by which respondents expected machines \"that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human\" (assuming no [[global catastrophic risks|global catastrophe]] occurs) with 10% confidence is 2024 (mean 2034, st. dev. 33 years), with 50% confidence is 2050 (mean 2072, st. dev. 110 years), and with 90% confidence is 2070 (mean 2168, st. dev. 342 years). These estimates exclude the 1.2% of respondents who said no year would ever reach 10% confidence, the 4.1% who said 'never' for 50% confidence, and the 16.5% who said 'never' for 90% confidence. Respondents assigned a median 50% probability to the possibility that machine superintelligence will be invented within 30 years of the invention of approximately human-level machine intelligence.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|Bostrom|2016|pp=3-4, 6, 9-12}}\n\n== Design considerations ==\nBostrom expressed concern about what values a superintelligence should be designed to have. He compared several proposals:{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=209-221}}\n* The [[coherent extrapolated volition]] (CEV) proposal is that it should have the values upon which humans would converge.\n* The [[moral rightness]] (MR) proposal is that it should value moral rightness.\n* The [[moral permissibility]] (MP) proposal is that it should value staying within the bounds of moral permissibility (and otherwise have CEV values).\n\nBostrom clarifies these terms:\n<blockquote>instead of implementing humanity's coherent extrapolated volition, one could try to build an AI with the goal of doing what is morally right, relying on the AI\u2019s superior cognitive capacities to figure out just which actions fit that description. We can call this proposal \u201cmoral rightness\u201d (MR)...\n\nMR would also appear to have some disadvantages. It relies on the notion of \u201cmorally right,\u201d a notoriously difficult concept, one with which philosophers have grappled since antiquity without yet attaining consensus as to its analysis.

A superintelligence may or may not be created by an [[Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion|intelligence explosion]] and associated with a [[technological singularity]].\n\n[[University of Oxford]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] defines ''superintelligence'' as \"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\".{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|loc=Chapter 2}} The program [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] falls short of superintelligence\u2014even though it is much better than humans at chess\u2014because Fritz cannot outperform humans in other tasks.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=22}} Following Hutter and Legg, Bostrom treats superintelligence as general dominance at goal-oriented behavior, leaving open whether an artificial or human superintelligence would possess capacities such as [[intentionality]] (cf. the [[Chinese room]] argument) or [[qualia|first-person consciousness]] ([[cf.]] the [[hard problem of consciousness]]).\n\nTechnological researchers disagree about how likely present-day [[human intelligence]] is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of [[futures studies]] scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to [[brain\u2013computer interface|interface with computers]], or [[mind uploading|upload their minds to computers]], in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.\n\nSome researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of [[artificial general intelligence]]. The first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of [[perfect recall]], a vastly superior knowledge base, and the ability to [[Human multitasking|multitask]] in ways not possible to biological entities. This may give them the opportunity to\u2014either as a single being or as a new [[species]]\u2014become much more powerful than humans, and to displace them.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|loc=Chapter 2}}\n\nA number of scientists and forecasters argue for prioritizing early research into the possible benefits and risks of [[Intelligence amplification|human and machine cognitive enhancement]], because of the potential social impact of such technologies.{{sfn|Legg|2008|pp=135-137}}\n\n==Feasibility of artificial superintelligence==\n[[File:Classification of images progress human.png|thumb|Progress in machine classification of images\n--------------------------\nThe error rate of AI by year. Red line - the error rate of a trained human\n]]\nPhilosopher [[David Chalmers]] argues that [[artificial general intelligence]] is a very likely path to superhuman intelligence. Chalmers breaks this claim down into an argument that AI can achieve ''equivalence'' to human intelligence, that it can be ''extended'' to surpass human intelligence, and that it can be further ''amplified'' to completely dominate humans across arbitrary tasks.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=7}}\n\nConcerning human-level equivalence, Chalmers argues that the human brain is a mechanical system, and therefore ought to be emulatable by synthetic materials.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=7-9}} He also notes that human intelligence was able to biologically evolve, making it more likely that human engineers will be able to recapitulate this invention. [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s in particular should be able to produce human-level AI.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=10-11}} Concerning intelligence extension and amplification, Chalmers argues that new AI technologies can generally be improved on, and that this is particularly likely when the invention can assist in designing new technologies.{{sfn|Chalmers|2010|p=11-13}}\n\nIf research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself &ndash; a feature called \"recursive self-improvement\". It would then be even better at improving itself, and could continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to a superintelligence. This scenario is known as an [[intelligence explosion]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and may be able to invent or discover almost anything.\n\nComputer components already greatly surpass human performance in speed.  Bostrom writes, \"Biological neurons operate at a peak speed of about 200 Hz, a full seven orders of magnitude slower than a modern microprocessor (~2 GHz).\"{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=59}} Moreover, [[neuron]]s transmit spike signals across [[axon]]s at no greater than 120 m/s, \"whereas existing electronic processing cores can communicate optically at the speed of light\". Thus, the simplest example of a superintelligence may be an emulated human mind that's run on much faster hardware than the brain. A human-like reasoner that could think millions of times faster than current humans would have a dominant advantage in most reasoning tasks, particularly ones that require haste or long strings of actions.\n\nAnother advantage of computers is modularity, that is, their size or computational capacity can be increased.  A non-human (or modified human) brain could become much larger than a present-day human brain, like many [[supercomputer]]s. Bostrom also raises the possibility of ''collective superintelligence'': a large enough number of separate reasoning systems, if they communicated and coordinated well enough, could act in aggregate with far greater capabilities than any sub-agent.\n\nThere may also be ways to ''qualitatively'' improve on human reasoning and decision-making. Humans appear to differ from [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in the ways we think more than we differ in brain size or speed.<ref>{{cite techreport |first=Eliezer |last=Yudkowsky |authorlink=Eliezer Yudkowsky |title=Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics |url=http://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf |number=2013-1 |institution=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] |year=2013 |page=35}}</ref> Humans outperform non-human animals in large part because of new or enhanced reasoning capacities, such as long-term planning and [[great ape language|language use]]. (See [[evolution of human intelligence]] and [[primate cognition]].) If there are other possible improvements to reasoning that would have a similarly large impact, this makes it likelier that an agent can be built that outperforms humans in the same fashion humans outperform chimpanzees.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=56-57}}\n\nAll of the above advantages hold for artificial superintelligence, but it is not clear how many hold for biological superintelligence. Physiological constraints limit the speed and size of biological brains in many ways that are inapplicable to machine intelligence. As such, writers on superintelligence have devoted much more attention to superintelligent AI scenarios.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=52, 59-61}}\n\n==Feasibility of biological superintelligence==\n[[Carl Sagan]] suggested that the advent of [[Caesarean section]]s and [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] may permit humans to evolve larger heads, resulting in improvements via [[natural selection]] in the [[adaptive evolution in the human genome|heritable]] component of [[human intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan |date=1977 |title=The Dragons of Eden |url= |location= |publisher=Random House |isbn= |accessdate=|title-link=The Dragons of Eden }}</ref> By contrast, [[Gerald Crabtree]] has argued that decreased selection pressure is resulting in a slow, centuries-long [[Fertility and Intelligence|reduction in human intelligence]], and that this process instead is likely to continue into the future. There is no scientific consensus concerning either possibility, and in both cases the biological change would be slow, especially relative to rates of cultural change.\n\n[[Selective breeding]], [[nootropics]], [[NSI-189]], [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-I's]], [[Epigenetics|epigenetic modulation]], and [[genetic engineering]] could improve human intelligence more rapidly. Bostrom writes that if we come to understand the genetic component of intelligence, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis could be used to select for embryos with as much as 4 points of IQ gain (if one embryo is selected out of two), or with larger gains (e.g., up to 24.3 IQ points gained if one embryo is selected out of 1000). If this process is iterated over many generations, the gains could be an order of magnitude greater. Bostrom suggests that deriving new gametes from embryonic stem cells could be used to iterate the selection process very rapidly.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=37-39}} A well-organized society of high-intelligence humans of this sort could potentially achieve [[collective intelligence|collective]] superintelligence.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|p=39}}\n\nAlternatively, collective intelligence might be constructible by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. A number of writers have suggested that human civilization, or some aspect of it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a [[global brain]] with capacities far exceeding its component agents. If this systems-based superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components, however, it may qualify as an AI rather than as a biology-based [[superorganism]].{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=48-49}}. A [[prediction market]] is sometimes considered an example of working collective intelligence system, consisting of humans only.<ref>{{cite|title=Prediction Markets as an Aggregation Mechanism for Collective Intelligence|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mg0p0zc|year=2007|last=Watkins|first=Jennifer H.}}</ref> \n\nA final method of intelligence amplification would be to directly [[Neuroenhancement|enhance]] individual humans, as opposed to enhancing their social or reproductive dynamics. This could be achieved using [[nootropics]], somatic [[gene therapy]], or [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s. However, Bostrom expresses skepticism about the scalability of the first two approaches, and argues that designing a superintelligent [[cyborg]] interface is an [[AI-complete]] problem.{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=36-37, 42, 47}}\n\n== Forecasts ==\nMost surveyed AI researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence, though there is little consensus on when this will likely happen. At the 2006 [[AI@50]] conference, 18% of attendees reported expecting machines to be able \"to simulate learning and every other aspect of human intelligence\" by 2056; 41% of attendees expected this to happen sometime after 2056; and 41% expected machines to never reach that milestone.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maker|first1=Meg Houston|title=AI@50: First Poll|url=http://www.megmaker.com/2006/07/ai50_first_poll.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513052243/http://www.megmaker.com/2006/07/ai50_first_poll.html|archivedate=2014-05-13|date=July 13, 2006}}</ref> \n\nIn a survey of the 100 most cited authors in AI (as of May 2013, according to Microsoft academic search), the median year by which respondents expected machines \"that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human\" (assuming no [[global catastrophic risks|global catastrophe]] occurs) with 10% confidence is 2024 (mean 2034, st. dev. 33 years), with 50% confidence is 2050 (mean 2072, st. dev. 110 years), and with 90% confidence is 2070 (mean 2168, st. dev. 342 years). These estimates exclude the 1.2% of respondents who said no year would ever reach 10% confidence, the 4.1% who said 'never' for 50% confidence, and the 16.5% who said 'never' for 90% confidence. Respondents assigned a median 50% probability to the possibility that machine superintelligence will be invented within 30 years of the invention of approximately human-level machine intelligence.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|Bostrom|2016|pp=3-4, 6, 9-12}}\n\n== Design considerations ==\nBostrom expressed concern about what values a superintelligence should be designed to have. He compared several proposals:{{sfn|Bostrom|2014|pp=209-221}}\n* The [[coherent extrapolated volition]] (CEV) proposal is that it should have the values upon which humans would converge.\n* The [[moral rightness]] (MR) proposal is that it should value moral rightness.\n* The [[moral permissibility]] (MP) proposal is that it should value staying within the bounds of moral permissibility (and otherwise have CEV values).\n\nBostrom clarifies these terms:\n<blockquote>instead of implementing humanity's coherent extrapolated volition, one could try to build an AI with the goal of doing what is morally right, relying on the AI\u2019s superior cognitive capacities to figure out just which actions fit that description. We can call this proposal \u201cmoral rightness\u201d (MR)...\n\nMR would also appear to have some disadvantages. It relies on the notion of \u201cmorally right,\u201d a notoriously difficult concept, one with which philosophers have grappled since antiquity without yet attaining consensus as to its analysis. Picking an erroneous explication of \u201cmoral rightness\u201d could result in outcomes that would be morally very wrong... The path to endowing an AI with any of these [moral] concepts might involve giving it general linguistic ability (comparable, at least, to that of a normal human adult).

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

He trained as a modeller and worked in V\u00edtkovice Ironworks.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, the war was coming and Mr. Franti\u0161ek Wawre\u010dka and his friend decided to go to Poland, where the military group of General Ludv\u00edk Svoboda was formed. Their journey led through Poland to the Soviet Union through Moscow and Odessa, the ship sailed through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and through Istanbul further to the Middle East to Palestine to General Klap\u00e1lek. As members of the Infantry Battalion, they were sent by the Western Desert to occupied Tobruk Fortress in Libya. Here he spent almost three years of war hardship with various movements along the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIn 1942 they were retrained to an anti-aircraft regiment and temporarily anchored in Palestinian Haifa as an airport defense. In 1943 they circumnavigated the African continent to England, where Mr. Wawre\u010dka took a course for drivers and became a member of the motorized battalion. In 1944 they besieged French Dunkirk and remained there until the end of the war. Mr. Wawre\u010dka returned to his native country - Czechoslovakia after a long six-year period.\n\nHe also met his future wife Helena Sporkov\u00e1 in Mysl\u00edva, whom he married in the autumn of 1945. They went to Ostrava for a short time, where their son Vladim\u00edr was born. Since Mrs. Helena Wawre\u010dkov\u00e1's father was left alone in Myself, everyone returned. From 1947, Mr. Wawre\u010dka began working in Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 \u0160koda as a wood-modeler with whom he was trained. He remained faithful to this job until 1970, when he retired.\n\nFor his courage and bravery, which Mr. Wawre\u010dka showed by going abroad, he received many awards and honors such as Czechoslovak War Cross, Polish War Cross, Medal of Valor, Medal for Defense of Poland, African Star of the Eighth Brigade, Award 1939-45, Star for Participation in war, Medal of Merit, for the fight against fascism, commemorative medals and many others. At the end of 2005, Mr. Wawre\u010dka was awarded the highest French Order of the Legion of Honor and was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 2006 he was solemnly named Honorary Citizen of Mysl\u00edv Municipality.\n\nStanislav Kub\u00edk (1930) - researcher\n\nProfessor, ing. Stanislav Kub\u00edk, doctor of technical sciences, full member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, was born November 15, 1930 in the family blacksmith village Mysl\u00edva. He attended elementary school in Mysl\u00edva, the Secondary School in Nepomuk and the Industrial School in Pilsen. He obtained his engineering degree at the University of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (V\u0160SE) in Pilsen, then he completed his scientific studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague. He is one of the founders of the field of technical cybernetics in Czechoslovakia and the main builder of this field at V\u0160SE in Pilsen. He worked as the head of the Department of Technical Cybernetics and was the Rector of the University of Economics in Pilsen. After leaving the University of Economics, he was the director of the Institute of Information Theory and Automation of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (\u010cSAV), the scientific secretary of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and then the vice-chairman of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe achieved the most important professional results in the field of analysis and synthesis of nonlinear dynamic systems. He is the author and co-author of many scientific and professional articles and treatises published in Czech and foreign journals and conferences, twelve monographs published in Czechoslovakia and abroad, and research reports resulting from cooperation with industrial and research organizations.\n\nMarta's wife is an electrical engineer.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n[[Gordon Freeman]] dies in the sequel\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick. Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series. [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n==Production==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

While Siskel found it to be \"surprisingly weak\" given director Don Bluth's previous works, due largely to its \"confusing story\" and \"needlessly violent\" scenes, Ebert was a huge fan of the movie's \"rubbery and kind of flexible\" animation, stating he felt it was a good film despite not being an \"animated classic\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/2HXX7H1NH7AA/Back-to-the-Future-Part-II--All-Dogs-Go-to-Heaven--Henry-V-1989 |publisher=Siskel & Ebert.org |accessdate=October 30, 2015 |title=Back to the Future Part II / All Dogs Go to Heaven / Henry V (1989)}}</ref>\n\nSome also found the darker subject material objectionable in a family film,<ref>{{cite news|last=Kempley|first=Rita|title='All Dogs Go to Heaven' (G)|work=New York Times|date=November 17, 1989|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/alldogsgotoheaven.htm |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Jay|title=All Dogs Go to Heaven Review|work=Boston Globe|date=November 17, 1989}}</ref> given the film's depictions of death, violence, theft, drinking, smoking, gambling, murder, [[demon]]s, and images of [[Hell]].

Somewhat unusually, production investors Goldcrest Films covered the cost of the [[release print]]s and the promotional campaign, in return for a greatly reduced distribution fee from UA. This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, ''The Secret of NIMH''. Goldcrest Films invested $15 million in printing and promoting the film.

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick. Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series. [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n==Production==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio.

Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

Somewhat unusually, production investors Goldcrest Films covered the cost of the [[release print]]s and the promotional campaign, in return for a greatly reduced distribution fee from UA. This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, ''The Secret of NIMH''.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure.

The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]].

The snout was narrow with forward-pointing nostrils, and the large orbits likely provided ''Silesaurus'' with acute vision.\n\nInitially, ''Silesaurus'' was thought to be strictly [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], but later research on [[coprolite]] contents indicates that it may have been insectivorous.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author1=Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m |author2=Joel Vikberg Wernstr\u00f6m |author3=Rafa\u0142 Piechowski |author4=Mateusz Ta\u0142anda |author5=Per E.

The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power. The dictatorship presented its mission as a \"national reconstruction.\" The coup was the result of multiple forces, including pressure from conservative and women\u2019s groups, certain political parties, union strikes and other domestic unrest, as well as international factors. According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative [[Jack Devine]], although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup, subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government.<ref>Jack Devine & Peter Kornbluh, 'Showdown in Santiago: What Really Happened in Chile?', Foreign Affairs 93 (2014), 168-174.</ref>\n\nThe regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the [[history of Chile]]. Overall, the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing, tortured tens of thousands of prisoners,<ref name=\"BBC-Chile\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114035710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}</ref> and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1            = Wright\n| first1           = T.C.\n| last2            = O\u00f1ate\n| first2           = R.\n| contribution     = Chilean Diaspora\n| editor-last1     = Ember\n| editor-first1    = M.\n| editor-last2     = Ember\n| editor-first2    = C.R.\n| editor-last3     = Skoggard\n| editor-first3    = I.\n| title            = Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World\n| volume           = II\n| pages            = 57\u201365\n| place            = \n| date = 2005\n| contribution-url = \n}}</ref> The dictatorship's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt. Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]].

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged. The faked combat tactic ameliorated criticism of the regime implicitly putting culpability on the victim. It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat. The faked combats reinforced the dictatorship narrative on the existence of an \"internal war\" which it used to justify its existence.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Silva Hidalgo |first=Robinson Humberto |date=2014 |title=Resistencia pol\u00edtica y origen del movimiento social anti dictatorial en Chile (1973\u20131988) |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Universitat de Barcelona]] |url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |page=341\u2013349 |language=Spanish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216184935/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-16 }}</ref> A particular fake combat event, lasting from September 8 to 9 1983, occurred when forces of the CNI lobbed grenades into a house, detonating the structure and killing the two men and a woman who were in the building.

The official story became that the three suspects had caused the explosion themselves by trying to burn and destroy incriminating evidence.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert.

MIR assassinated the head of the Army Intelligence school, Lieutenant Roger Vergara, with machine gun fire in the late 1970s.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.'' and in cite 46: ''According to Clar\u00edn, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decisionmakers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''</ref> But the relations remained tense as Argentina invaded the Falklands ([[Operation Rosario]]). Chile along with [[Colombia]], were the only countries in South America to criticize the use of force by Argentina in its war with the UK over the [[Falkland Islands]]. Chile actually helped the United Kingdom during the war. The two countries (Chile and Argentina) finally agreed to papal mediation over the Beagle canal that finally ended in the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad''). Chilean sovereignty over the islands and Argentinian east of the surrounding sea is now undisputed.\n\nIn 1980, [[Philippines|Philippine]] President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] had invited the entire Junta (consisting at this point of Pinochet, Merino, Matthei, and Mendoza) to visit the country as part of a planned tour of Southeast Asia in an attempt to help improve their image and bolster military and economic relations with the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes. The usually stoic and calm Pinochet became enraged, firing his Foreign Minister Hernan Cubillos, several diplomats, and expelling the Philippine Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/04/02/filipino-rebuff-humiliates-pinochet/60da7bd2-b648-480f-909e-5651f5bea8ec/|title=Filipino Rebuff Humiliates Pinochet|first=Charles A.|last=Krause|date=2 April 1980|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023175426/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/04/02/filipino-rebuff-humiliates-pinochet/60da7bd2-b648-480f-909e-5651f5bea8ec/|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Helen Spooner, ''Soldiers in a narrow land: the Pinochet regime in Chile'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&id=lE1G1OBhsbMC url]</ref>  Relations between the two countries were restored only in 1986 when [[Corazon Aquino]] assumed the presidency of the Philippines after Marcos was ousted in a non-violent revolution, the [[People Power Revolution]].\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|United States intervention in Chile}}\n[[File:Orlando Letelier, Washingron DC, 1976 (de Marcelo Montecino).jpg|thumb|right|[[Orlando Letelier]], a former Chilean minister, was assassinated in Washington, D.C. in 1976]]\n[[File:Nlc02585cs.jpg|thumb|Pinochet meeting with U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] in Washington, D.C., September 6, 1977]]\nThe U.S. government had been interfering in Chilean politics since 1961, and it spent millions trying to prevent Allende from coming to power, and subsequently undermined his presidency through financing opposition.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

On his 91st birthday on 25 November 2006, in a public statement to supporters, Pinochet for the first time claimed to accept \"political responsibility\" for what happened in Chile under his regime, though he still defended the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] against Salvador Allende. In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...

The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power.

Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]].

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged.

It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat. The faked combats reinforced the dictatorship narrative on the existence of an \"internal war\" which it used to justify its existence.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Silva Hidalgo |first=Robinson Humberto |date=2014 |title=Resistencia pol\u00edtica y origen del movimiento social anti dictatorial en Chile (1973\u20131988) |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Universitat de Barcelona]] |url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |page=341\u2013349 |language=Spanish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216184935/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-16 }}</ref> A particular fake combat event, lasting from September 8 to 9 1983, occurred when forces of the CNI lobbed grenades into a house, detonating the structure and killing the two men and a woman who were in the building.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

He returned to Chile in March 2000 but was not charged with the crimes against him. On his 91st birthday on 25 November 2006, in a public statement to supporters, Pinochet for the first time claimed to accept \"political responsibility\" for what happened in Chile under his regime, though he still defended the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] against Salvador Allende. In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...
