KG''' is a German multinational [[computer rity software]] company mainly known for their [[antivirus software]] ''Avira Free Security''.\n\nAvira was founded in 2006, but the anti virus application is under active development since 1986 through its predecessor company H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH.\n\nAs of 2012, Avira software is estimated to have over 100 million customers. In June 2012, Avira ranked sixth in the antivirus market share report from OPSWAT.<ref name=\"about avira\" /><ref name=\"OPSWAT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/about/media/reports/antivirus-june-2012|title=Market Share Report June 2012|author=OPSWAT|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAvira's headquarters are located near [[Lake Constance]], in [[Tettnang]], Germany.

The \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 were the initial letters of their wives\u2019 first names.\n\n1988 \u2013 H+BEDV launched the protection program AntiVir, one of the first antivirus programs, to combat some of the first dangerous computer viruses that were already spreading at a phenomenal rate. AntiVir protected and repaired infected Microsoft DOS systems. The company also launched business security solutions at this time.\n\n1990 \u2013 With only six employees, management incorporated the company, giving H+BEDV Datentechnik Germany\u2019s \"GmbH\" status.\n\n1991 \u2013 DOS system infections continued to rise, and thus AntiVir continually underwent improvements to counter new threats.\n\n1994 \u2013 The product range extended to include AntiVir for Windows 3.x and AntiVir for Novell NetWare.\n\n1995 \u2013 Launches included AntiVir for Windows 95/NT (Workstation and Server), AntiVir for Linux (Workstation and Server, free to consumers) and AntiVir for OS/2.\n\n1996 \u2013 AntiVir FDBlock, one of the few memory-resident DOS antivirus programs, was introduced to stop boot-sector viruses from spreading.\n\n1997 \u2013 The company continued to develop increasingly sophisticated software that included: integrity monitoring with different check sum algorithms, an automatic Update Wizard, the quarantine directory, the ability to define the level to which archives were unpacked, emailed alerts, negative classification of boot and master boot sectors, and heuristic macro virus detection.\n\n1998 \u2013 Launches included AntiVir for Windows 98 and the \u2018campus license\u2019: schools and universities and other educational institutions could obtain AntiVir at a major discount via an \"AntiVir for the computer room\" campaign.\n\n1999 \u2013 The Personal Edition antivirus for private, non-commercial use was made available to download for free, making it one of the pioneers of the \u2018freemium\u2019 business model. The company presented a global first in AV Guard, the first resistant virus guard under Linux, and Secure AntiVirus Application Programming Interface (SAVAPI) virus protection as a component. With SAVAPI, third-party manufacturers had the option to include virus protection functionality in their products, and Watchdog and MIMEsweeper were among the first to use it.\n\n2000 \u2013 AntiVir for Windows ME was launched, and MailGate for Linux joined the product family to offer email protection.\n\n2001 \u2013 The company made virus protection available for Windows XP at the same time the OS was launched, setting a milestone in speed and customer orientation. AntiVir for OpenBSD/FreeBSD was introduced.\n\n2002 \u2013 The AntiVir Rescue System offered a rescue tool that booted and scanned for virus infections without using an external OS. In cooperation with a partner, the company developed virus protection for DSL networks software (AntiVir for AVM KEN!). The newly developed data access control module Dazuko scanned files in real time upon opening, closing, and execution. AntiVir received accreditations from many sources, including ICSA Labs, and the AntiVir online shop was launched.\n\n2003 \u2013 New product launches included proxy server protection AntiVir WebGate for Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD, AntiVir Milter for Sendmail, AntiVir Lotus Notes/Domino, AntiVir ISA Server, and AntiVir Exchange for Servers 2000/2003. Partnerships formed with SuSE, Red Hat, Group Technologies, Clearswift (AntiVir MAILsweeper, AntiVir WEBsweeper), Pyramid Computers, and Central Command.\n\n2004 \u2013 The company established a main branch office in Bucharest, Romania. Protection from Internet dialers was integrated in AntiVir and a 'convenience package' was introduced: customers got a bootable CD-ROM (with updates made available by mail), a printed installation manual, free support, and a command-line scanner. AntiVir for FreeBSD was equipped with an on-access scanner. Other launches included the Security Management Console, the SPAM filter AntiVir eXpurgate, AntiVir for Sun Sparc Solaris, AntiVir SmallBusiness (the first full-protection bundle for businesses), and AntiVir for Windows 2000. Annual sales rose to over 8 million euros, with just over 120 employees.\n\n2005 \u2013 AntiVir version 7 was launched and the company reached its 10 millionth user. AntiVir Mobile Security for PDAs and smartphones was introduced. AntiVir Virus Scan Adapter (for SAP Solutions) became the first virus protection solution to be SAP certified. The company began to offer security consulting to commercial businesses, received numerous VB100 certifications, attained Microsoft-Gold partnership level, was accredited by Germany\u2019s Association for Technical Inspection (T\u00dcV), and began close cooperation with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\n2006 \u2013 Avira GmbH was formed when the original H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH and its sister company AntiVir PersonalProducts GmbH merged. Avira GmbH opened a new branch office in Austria.\n\n2008 \u2013 A major update was made to the scan engine, which increased scanning speed by 20%. The company reached 200 employees, became officially SAP certified, became a founding member of IT SMIG (IT Security Made in Germany), and launched a French version of Avira Free Antivirus.\n\n2009 \u2013 Avira opened branch offices in Switzerland, Japan, and Malaysia and celebrated 10 years of its freemium software offerings by reaching its 100 millionth user \u2013 all with around 300 employees.\n\n2010 \u2013 In addition to opening new Northern-Asia headquarters in Hong Kong (as Avira North Asia) and its branch offices in Beijing, Avira also obtained an office in the Netherlands when it acquired the company CleanPort, to help bring managed security services \"in the cloud\" to the Avira portfolio. A new sub-office and Virus Lab was also opened in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n2011 \u2013 Avira launched both its SafeSearch toolbar and a free version for Mac OS X. Reaching 500 employees, the company built a new HQ building in Tettnang, Germany, and opened a branch office in the USA\u2019s Silicon Valley. The company also partnered with Qihoo in China.\n\n2012 \u2013 Avira acquired the US-based \"Social Shield\" protection for children from undesirable social-network content. The company launched Android Anti-theft, Avira Answers (user forum), and Avira Cloud protection technology, and it began partnerships with Baidu and Tencent in China.\n\n2013 \u2013 Co-founder Tjark Auerbach stepped down as CEO, but remained the majority shareholder of Avira. Travis Witteveen replaced Mr. Auerbach as CEO at the beginning of H2 2013. Avira expanded its Android security offering and launched both iOS security and its Online Essentials solution.\n\n2014 \u2013 Avira developed its Browser Safety and SafeSearch browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. The company launched a premium version of its Android app and Identity Safeguard, which checks emails against a database of public security breaches. Avira introduced also the Avira App Store and opened a new office in Munich, Germany.\n -->\n\n== Technology ==\n\n=== Virus Definition ===\nAvira periodically \"cleans out\" its virus definition files, replacing specific signatures with generic ones for a general increase in performance and scanning speed. A 15{{nbsp}}[[Megabyte|MB]] database clean-out was made on 27 October 2008, causing problems to the users of the Free edition because of its large size and Avira's slow Free edition servers. Avira responded by reducing the size of the individual update files, delivering less data in each update. Nowadays there are 32 smaller definition files that are updated regularly in order to avoid peaks in the download of the updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/press-details/nid/439/news/nvdf+update|title=AVIRA News \u2013 Free version: Avira optimizes update system|publisher=Avira.com|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Advance Heuristic ===\n\nAvira products contain heuristics that can proactively uncover unknown malware, before a special virus signature to combat the damaging element has been created and before a virus guard update has been sent.\n\nHeuristic virus detection involves extensive analysis and investigation of the affected codes for functions typical of malware. \nIf the code being scanned exhibits these characteristic features it is reported as being suspicious, although not necessarily malware; the user decides whether to act on or ignore the warning.\n\n=== ProActiv ===\n\nThe ProActiv component uses rule sets developed by the Avira Malware Research Center to identify suspicious behavior. The rule sets are supplied by Avira databases. ProActiv sends information on suspicious programs to the Avira databases for logging.\n\n=== Firewall ===\nAvira removed their own firewall technology from 2014 onwards, with protection supplied instead by [[Windows Firewall]] ([[Windows 7]] and after), because in [[Windows 8]] and later the Microsoft Certification Program forces developers to use interfaces introduced in [[Windows Vista]].<ref name=\"TDI filters and LSPs are not allowed - Windows 8.1 HCK\" >{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj124262(v=vs.85).aspx|title=TDI filters and LSPs are not allowed - Windows 8.1 HCK|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Protection Cloud ===\nAvira Protection Cloud (APC) was first introduced in version 2013. It uses information available via the Internet (cloud computing) to improve detection and affect system performance less. This technology was implemented in all paid 2013 products.\nAPC was initially only used during a manual quick system scan; later it was extended to real-time protection. This improved Avira's score in the AV-Comparatives and Report from September 2013.\n<ref name=\"report\" >[http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avc_factsheet2013_09.pdf AV-Comparative RealWorld Test September Fact Sheet (PDF)]</ref>\n\n== Partners ==\nAvira offers its antivirus engine in the form of a [[software development kit]] to implement in complementary products. Strategic and technology partners of Avira include Canonical, CYAN Networks, IBM, intelligence AG, Microsoft, novell, OPSWAT, Synergy Systems and others.\n\nOn 4 September 2014 Avira announced a partnership with Dropbox, to combine Avira's security with Dropbox's \"sync and share\" capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avira Partners with Dropbox to Bring Secure Sync and Share to Millions Globally|url=https://www.avira.com/en/press-details?nid=959&news=avira-partners-with-dropbox|publisher=Avira.com}}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\n{{Cleanup|reason=It is outdated, incomplete and wrong.|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Windows ===\n{{Infobox software\n| name               = Avira Free Antivirus\n| screenshot         = Avira Internet Security 2012.png\n| caption            = Avira Internet Security 2013 in [[Windows 7]]\n| developer          = <!-- Avira already here -->\n| released           = 1988\n| operating system   = [[Windows 7]] and later\n| language           = <!-- Full list of languages goes here -->\n| genre              = [[Antivirus software]]\n| license            = [[Freemium]]\n| website            = hide\n}}\n\nAvira offers the following security products and tools for [[Microsoft Windows]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/buy-antivirus|title=Avira Official Store|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/downloads|title=Avira Download Center|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Free Antivirus: The free edition antivirus/anti-spyware, for non-commercial use, with promotional pop-ups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/free-antivirus-windows|title=Avira Free Antivirus Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Antivirus Pro: The premium edition antivirus/anti-spyware.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-antivirus-pro|title=Avira Antivirus Pro Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira System Speedup Free: A free suite of PC tune-up tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-system-speedup-free|title=Avira Free System Speedup Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira System Speedup Pro: The premium edition of the suite of PC tune-up tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-system-speedup|title=Avira System Speedup Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Internet Security Suite: Consists of Antivirus Pro + System Speedup + Firewall Manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-internet-security-suite|title=Avira Internet Security Suite Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Ultimate Protection Suite: Consists of Internet Security Suite + additional PC maintenance tools (e.g. SuperEasy Driver Updater).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-ultimate-protection-suite|title=Avira Ultimate Protection Suite Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n* Avira Rescue System: A set of free tools that include a utility used to write a [[Linux]]-based [[Live CD|bootable CD]].

That would have allowed the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.[https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=9718]\n\nIn 2010 Avira Management Console was hit by the [[use-after-free]] remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Avira Management Console. Authentication was not required to exploit the vulnerability.[http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-445/]\n\nIn 2013 Avira engines were hit by a [[Zero-day (computing)|0-day vulnerability]] that allowed attackers to get access to a customer's PC. The bug was found in the avipbb.sys driver file and allowed [[privilege escalation]].[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/29125/]\n\n== Awards and Reviews ==\nIn January 2008 Anti-Malware Test Lab

KG''' is a German multinational [[computer security software]] company mainly known for their [[antivirus software]] ''Avira Free Security''.\n\nAvira was founded in 2006, but the anti virus application is under active development since 1986 through its predecessor company H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH.\n\nAs of 2012, Avira software is estimated to have over 100 million customers. In June 2012, Avira ranked sixth in the antivirus market share report from OPSWAT.<ref name=\"about avira\" /><ref name=\"OPSWAT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/about/media/reports/antivirus-june-2012|title=Market Share Report June 2012|author=OPSWAT|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAvira's headquarters are located near [[Lake Constance]], in [[Tettnang]], Germany.

The \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 were the initial letters of their wives\u2019 first names.\n\n1988 \u2013 H+BEDV launched the protection program AntiVir, one of the first antivirus programs, to combat some of the first dangerous computer viruses that were already spreading at a phenomenal rate. AntiVir protected and repaired infected Microsoft DOS systems. The company also launched business security solutions at this time.\n\n1990 \u2013 With only six employees, management incorporated the company, giving H+BEDV Datentechnik Germany\u2019s \"GmbH\" status.\n\n1991 \u2013 DOS system infections continued to rise, and thus AntiVir continually underwent improvements to counter new threats.\n\n1994 \u2013 The product range extended to include AntiVir for Windows 3.x and AntiVir for Novell NetWare.\n\n1995 \u2013 Launches included AntiVir for Windows 95/NT (Workstation and Server), AntiVir for Linux (Workstation and Server, free to consumers) and AntiVir for OS/2.\n\n1996 \u2013 AntiVir FDBlock, one of the few memory-resident DOS antivirus programs, was introduced to stop boot-sector viruses from spreading.\n\n1997 \u2013 The company continued to develop increasingly sophisticated software that included: integrity monitoring with different check sum algorithms, an automatic Update Wizard, the quarantine directory, the ability to define the level to which archives were unpacked, emailed alerts, negative classification of boot and master boot sectors, and heuristic macro virus detection.\n\n1998 \u2013 Launches included AntiVir for Windows 98 and the \u2018campus license\u2019: schools and universities and other educational institutions could obtain AntiVir at a major discount via an \"AntiVir for the computer room\" campaign.\n\n1999 \u2013 The Personal Edition antivirus for private, non-commercial use was made available to download for free, making it one of the pioneers of the \u2018freemium\u2019 business model. The company presented a global first in AV Guard, the first resistant virus guard under Linux, and Secure AntiVirus Application Programming Interface (SAVAPI) virus protection as a component. With SAVAPI, third-party manufacturers had the option to include virus protection functionality in their products, and Watchdog and MIMEsweeper were among the first to use it.\n\n2000 \u2013 AntiVir for Windows ME was launched, and MailGate for Linux joined the product family to offer email protection.\n\n2001 \u2013 The company made virus protection available for Windows XP at the same time the OS was launched, setting a milestone in speed and customer orientation. AntiVir for OpenBSD/FreeBSD was introduced.\n\n2002 \u2013 The AntiVir Rescue System offered a rescue tool that booted and scanned for virus infections without using an external OS. In cooperation with a partner, the company developed virus protection for DSL networks software (AntiVir for AVM KEN!). The newly developed data access control module Dazuko scanned files in real time upon opening, closing, and execution. AntiVir received accreditations from many sources, including ICSA Labs, and the AntiVir online shop was launched.\n\n2003 \u2013 New product launches included proxy server protection AntiVir WebGate for Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD, AntiVir Milter for Sendmail, AntiVir Lotus Notes/Domino, AntiVir ISA Server, and AntiVir Exchange for Servers 2000/2003. Partnerships formed with SuSE, Red Hat, Group Technologies, Clearswift (AntiVir MAILsweeper, AntiVir WEBsweeper), Pyramid Computers, and Central Command.\n\n2004 \u2013 The company established a main branch office in Bucharest, Romania. Protection from Internet dialers was integrated in AntiVir and a 'convenience package' was introduced: customers got a bootable CD-ROM (with updates made available by mail), a printed installation manual, free support, and a command-line scanner. AntiVir for FreeBSD was equipped with an on-access scanner. Other launches included the Security Management Console, the SPAM filter AntiVir eXpurgate, AntiVir for Sun Sparc Solaris, AntiVir SmallBusiness (the first full-protection bundle for businesses), and AntiVir for Windows 2000. Annual sales rose to over 8 million euros, with just over 120 employees.\n\n2005 \u2013 AntiVir version 7 was launched and the company reached its 10 millionth user. AntiVir Mobile Security for PDAs and smartphones was introduced. AntiVir Virus Scan Adapter (for SAP Solutions) became the first virus protection solution to be SAP certified. The company began to offer security consulting to commercial businesses, received numerous VB100 certifications, attained Microsoft-Gold partnership level, was accredited by Germany\u2019s Association for Technical Inspection (T\u00dcV), and began close cooperation with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\n2006 \u2013 Avira GmbH was formed when the original H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH and its sister company AntiVir PersonalProducts GmbH merged. Avira GmbH opened a new branch office in Austria.\n\n2008 \u2013 A major update was made to the scan engine, which increased scanning speed by 20%. The company reached 200 employees, became officially SAP certified, became a founding member of IT SMIG (IT Security Made in Germany), and launched a French version of Avira Free Antivirus.\n\n2009 \u2013 Avira opened branch offices in Switzerland, Japan, and Malaysia and celebrated 10 years of its freemium software offerings by reaching its 100 millionth user \u2013 all with around 300 employees.\n\n2010 \u2013 In addition to opening new Northern-Asia headquarters in Hong Kong (as Avira North Asia) and its branch offices in Beijing, Avira also obtained an office in the Netherlands when it acquired the company CleanPort, to help bring managed security services \"in the cloud\" to the Avira portfolio. A new sub-office and Virus Lab was also opened in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n2011 \u2013 Avira launched both its SafeSearch toolbar and a free version for Mac OS X. Reaching 500 employees, the company built a new HQ building in Tettnang, Germany, and opened a branch office in the USA\u2019s Silicon Valley. The company also partnered with Qihoo in China.\n\n2012 \u2013 Avira acquired the US-based \"Social Shield\" protection for children from undesirable social-network content. The company launched Android Anti-theft, Avira Answers (user forum), and Avira Cloud protection technology, and it began partnerships with Baidu and Tencent in China.\n\n2013 \u2013 Co-founder Tjark Auerbach stepped down as CEO, but remained the majority shareholder of Avira. Travis Witteveen replaced Mr. Auerbach as CEO at the beginning of H2 2013. Avira expanded its Android security offering and launched both iOS security and its Online Essentials solution.\n\n2014 \u2013 Avira developed its Browser Safety and SafeSearch browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. The company launched a premium version of its Android app and Identity Safeguard, which checks emails against a database of public security breaches. Avira introduced also the Avira App Store and opened a new office in Munich, Germany.\n -->\n\n== Technology ==\n\n=== Virus Definition ===\nAvira periodically \"cleans out\" its virus definition files, replacing specific signatures with generic ones for a general increase in performance and scanning speed. A 15{{nbsp}}[[Megabyte|MB]] database clean-out was made on 27 October 2008, causing problems to the users of the Free edition because of its large size and Avira's slow Free edition servers. Avira responded by reducing the size of the individual update files, delivering less data in each update. Nowadays there are 32 smaller definition files that are updated regularly in order to avoid peaks in the download of the updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/press-details/nid/439/news/nvdf+update|title=AVIRA News \u2013 Free version: Avira optimizes update system|publisher=Avira.com|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Advance Heuristic ===\n\nAvira products contain heuristics that can proactively uncover unknown malware, before a special virus signature to combat the damaging element has been created and before a virus guard update has been sent.\n\nHeuristic virus detection involves extensive analysis and investigation of the affected codes for functions typical of malware. \nIf the code being scanned exhibits these characteristic features it is reported as being suspicious, although not necessarily malware; the user decides whether to act on or ignore the warning.\n\n=== ProActiv ===\n\nThe ProActiv component uses rule sets developed by the Avira Malware Research Center to identify suspicious behavior. The rule sets are supplied by Avira databases. ProActiv sends information on suspicious programs to the Avira databases for logging.\n\n=== Firewall ===\nAvira removed their own firewall technology from 2014 onwards, with protection supplied instead by [[Windows Firewall]] ([[Windows 7]] and after), because in [[Windows 8]] and later the Microsoft Certification Program forces developers to use interfaces introduced in [[Windows Vista]].<ref name=\"TDI filters and LSPs are not allowed - Windows 8.1 HCK\" >{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj124262(v=vs.85).aspx|title=TDI filters and LSPs are not allowed - Windows 8.1 HCK|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Protection Cloud ===\nAvira Protection Cloud (APC) was first introduced in version 2013. It uses information available via the Internet (cloud computing) to improve detection and affect system performance less. This technology was implemented in all paid 2013 products.\nAPC was initially only used during a manual quick system scan; later it was extended to real-time protection. This improved Avira's score in the AV-Comparatives and Report from September 2013.\n<ref name=\"report\" >[http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avc_factsheet2013_09.pdf AV-Comparative RealWorld Test September Fact Sheet (PDF)]</ref>\n\n== Partners ==\nAvira offers its antivirus engine in the form of a [[software development kit]] to implement in complementary products. Strategic and technology partners of Avira include Canonical, CYAN Networks, IBM, intelligence AG, Microsoft, novell, OPSWAT, Synergy Systems and others.\n\nOn 4 September 2014 Avira announced a partnership with Dropbox, to combine Avira's security with Dropbox's \"sync and share\" capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avira Partners with Dropbox to Bring Secure Sync and Share to Millions Globally|url=https://www.avira.com/en/press-details?nid=959&news=avira-partners-with-dropbox|publisher=Avira.com}}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\n{{Cleanup|reason=It is outdated, incomplete and wrong.|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Windows ===\n{{Infobox software\n| name               = Avira Free Antivirus\n| screenshot         = Avira Internet Security 2012.png\n| caption            = Avira Internet Security 2013 in [[Windows 7]]\n| developer          = <!-- Avira already here -->\n| released           = 1988\n| operating system   = [[Windows 7]] and later\n| language           = <!-- Full list of languages goes here -->\n| genre              = [[Antivirus software]]\n| license            = [[Freemium]]\n| website            = hide\n}}\n\nAvira offers the following security products and tools for [[Microsoft Windows]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/buy-antivirus|title=Avira Official Store|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/downloads|title=Avira Download Center|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Free Antivirus: The free edition antivirus/anti-spyware, for non-commercial use, with promotional pop-ups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/free-antivirus-windows|title=Avira Free Antivirus Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Antivirus Pro: The premium edition antivirus/anti-spyware.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-antivirus-pro|title=Avira Antivirus Pro Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira System Speedup Free: A free suite of PC tune-up tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-system-speedup-free|title=Avira Free System Speedup Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira System Speedup Pro: The premium edition of the suite of PC tune-up tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-system-speedup|title=Avira System Speedup Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Internet Security Suite: Consists of Antivirus Pro + System Speedup + Firewall Manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-internet-security-suite|title=Avira Internet Security Suite Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n* Avira Ultimate Protection Suite: Consists of Internet Security Suite + additional PC maintenance tools (e.g. SuperEasy Driver Updater).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avira.com/en/avira-ultimate-protection-suite|title=Avira Ultimate Protection Suite Product Page|publisher=Avira.com|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n* Avira Rescue System: A set of free tools that include a utility used to write a [[Linux]]-based [[Live CD|bootable CD]].

A remote attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by crafting an ACE archive and delivering it via a malicious web page or e-mail. A buffer overflow could occur when Avira scanned the malicious archive. That would have allowed the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.[https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=9718]\n\nIn 2010 Avira Management Console was hit by the [[use-after-free]] remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Avira Management Console. Authentication was not required to exploit the vulnerability.[http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-445/]\n\nIn 2013 Avira engines were hit by a [[Zero-day (computing)|0-day vulnerability]] that allowed attackers to get access to a customer's PC. The bug was found in the avipbb.sys driver file and allowed [[privilege escalation]].[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/29125/]\n\n== Awards and Reviews ==\nIn January 2008 Anti-Malware Test Lab

It was marketed as the '''Ford Taunus 12M''', and, between 1955 and 1959, as the larger-engined '''Ford Taunus 15M'''. The company produced a succession of Ford Taunus 12M models until 1970, as the name was applied to a succession of similarly sized cars, but the first Taunus 12M models, based on the company's Taunus Project 1 (P1), remained in production only until 1962. In that year the Taunus P1 series was replaced by the [[Ford Taunus P4|Taunus P4]] series.\n\nAt its launch, the car placed Ford ahead of the pack, being unusually modern in terms of the bits that showed.  It was one of the first new cars to appear in Germany since before the [[Second World War|war]], and featured a radical [[ponton (automobile)|ponton]] format \u201cthree box\u201d body as pioneered (at least in Germany) by the 1949 [[Borgward Hansa 1500|Borgward]].  The three-box car body format would soon become mainstream, but when the Ford Taunus 12M appeared in 1952 competitor manufacturers including [[Opel]], [[Volkswagen]] and [[Auto Union]] were still competing with models based closely on designs originating in the 1930s.\n\n==Globe Taunus / \u201eWeltkugeltaunus\u201c (1952\u20131959)==\n\n===Development===\nPlanning for Ford Germany's new [[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]] bodied passenger car began in 1949.  Several aspects of the car's development reflected the advantages and the disadvantages of running a business with management decisions necessarily split between two continents at a time when even international telephone calls needed to be pre-booked.\n\nThe original plan for the strikingly modern design came from Ford in the USA who drew up a proposal based on the ponton format [[Studebaker Champion|Champion]] model introduced to the US auto-market a few years earlier by [[Studebaker]].  The Studebaker design had already proved highly influential on the domestic programs of mainstream US auto-makers.  Cologne based production engineers adapted the US proposal for the German market.  The Studebaker featured a large roundel directly above the front grill on which was displayed the propeller of an airplane.  The Ford Project 1 also featured a prominent roundel at the front of the car, but in place of the Studebaker's propeller design, the Ford roundel featured a hemispherical depiction of half a globe.  This bold and unusual decoration led to the new car becoming known as the \u201eWeltkugeltaunus\u201c (Globe Taunus).\n\nThe proposal from Ford in America called for a [[monocoque]] construction, following the lead (in Germany) of the 1937 [[Opel Olympia]].   Ford of Germany had no experience of this construction method, having spent most of the 1940s concentrating on building light trucks.  Project 1's predecessor, the Ford Taunus designed in the 1930s, had had its body built by an independent specialist pressed steel body builder in Berlin until 1948, and after the Berlin firm had its surviving plant crated up and shipped to the [[Soviet Union]], Ford had in 1948 been driven to having Ford Taunus bodies produced by competitors and specialists from northern Germany, [[Volkswagen]] and [[Karmann]].  Ford's Cologne management sought cooperation from other German auto-makers with developing the processes necessary for producing the monocoque Project 1 model, but the other German auto-makers had priorities of their own, and in the end it was with support from [[Ford SAF|Ford of France]] that the production lines for German Ford's project 1 were set up at the company's Cologne plant.\nIn due course, and not before a certain amount of confusion concerning the naming of the car,  Ford's Project 1 was released to the market as the Ford Taunus 12M.  It proved a success.  By the time the half globe was removed from the car's nose, 247,174 of the 12M version had been sold along with 127,942 of the subsequently introduced Ford Taunus 15Ms.\n\n===The name===\nThe naming of the car is another area which may have been complicated by the way that responsibilities were shared between different management teams in two continents divided by an eight-hour time difference and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The immediate postwar era was seen as a new beginning for a newly divided Germany with, in [[West Germany|the west]], new borders, a new constitution and a new political class.  The monocoque bodied new model for 1952 also represented a new beginning for Ford, so identifying it as Ford of Germany's Project 1 (P1) was evidently uncontentious.\n<div style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 29.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 0.86em; font-family: lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\">\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #999999; background: #ffffff; text-align: left; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: left;\">'' Ford Taunus 12M/15M production (units):<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 357</ref>\n:::* 1952      30,650 \n:::* 1953      35,888\n:::* 1954      42,631 \n:::* 1955      58,456\n:::* 1956      64,872 \n:::* 1957      50,734\n:::* 1958      29,688\n:::* 1959      52,648\n:::* 1960      94,408\n:::* 1961      61,474\n:::* 1962      34,014\n\n:Totals ( saloons/sedans & estates/kombis):<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 362 & 363</ref>\n:1952-1959 Taunus 12M 1.2L: 215,265\n:1954-1958 Taunus 15M 1.5L: 134,127\n:1959-1962 Taunus 12M 1.2L: 126,581\n:1959-1962 Taunus 12M 1.5L: 69,191\n\nNot included in these totals are the saloons/sedans converted into two seater cabriolets by the Cologne based coach builder Karl Deutsch.\n\n</div></div>\nIn the 1930s Ford of Germany had, along with [[Opel]], pioneered the use of model names that would have positive associations for customers.  While [[Auto Union]] customers were enticed to buy cars with names such as [[DKW F8]] and [[BMW]] were inviting customers to be seduced by names such as [[BMW 326]], Ford were selling the [[Ford K\u00f6ln]], named after a major cathedral city as well as the [[Ford Eifel]] and the [[Ford Taunus]] named after hilly areas of great natural beauty.  For Project 1, Ford Germany evidently intended to invoke another hilly region of natural beauty, and the name \u201cFord Hunsr\u00fcck\u201d was thought uncontroversial for a successor to the Ford Taunus.  However, the \u201cHunsr\u00fcck\u201d name was blocked shortly before launch, possibly because of problems encountered explaining the pronunciation of \u201cHunsr\u00fcck\u201d to management colleagues in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]].  This left the name Taunus, and it was proposed to name the new car \u201cTaunus 12 Meisterst\u00fcck\" in order to differentiate it from the existing [[Ford Taunus G73A|Ford Taunus]] which was by now an aging model that would nevertheless continue to be listed in parallel with the new model throughout most of 1952.  However, it transpired that the name \u201cMeisterst\u00fcck\u201d (''\"Masterpiece\"'') was unavailable for any Ford vehicle, having been patent-protected by a German bicycle manufacturer.  Therefore, by the time Ford's radical new car came to market it arrived under the name \u201cFord Taunus 12M\u201d.  The \u201c12\u201d in the name referred to the engine size of 1.2 litres and the \u201cM\u201d was the only part of the \u201cMeisterst\u00fcck\u201d name available to Ford.\n\n===The engines===\nDuring development it was intended that the car would be powered by a 1,498&nbsp;cc engine.  This was in many respects the engine that had originally been intended for the [[Ford Taunus G73A|previous Ford Taunus]] first produced in 1939, but now it was to be developed into an ohv unit.  However, cost constraints intervened, and when the new Taunus 12M appeared in 1952 it was powered by the 1,172&nbsp;cc side-valve unit that had powered not merely its predecessor, but also its predecessor's predecessor, the [[Ford Eifel]] of 1935.\n\nBy 1952 sidevalve engines were already seen as old fashioned.  In an analysis undertaken of the models shown at the 1952 [[Paris Motor Show]] it was noted that 48 of the cars exhibited were fitted with engines employing overhead valves while only 6 featured sidevalve engines.<ref name=Automobilia1953>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ren\u00e9 Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1953 (salon Paris oct 1952)| volume =  14| pages = 5|year = 2000|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>   That Ford were still powering their entry level Taunus P1 with a sidevalve engine ten years later, in 1962, would leave the model looking badly outclassed under the bonnet/hood.\n\n===The body and running gear===\nThe two-door modern slab sided Ford Taunus that appeared in January 1952 with an old fashioned engine married to a stylish new body was connected with the road using fashionably small 13\u201c wheels which will have saved on cost and maximised the space available for passengers and their luggage.  Individually suspended front wheels marked a contrast with the approach taken with the original Taunus, but in 1952 the rigid rear axle was all too familiar to Ford's existing German customers.\nThe old Taunus had acquired the option of a four-speed gear box in 1950, but the new model at its 1952 launch came only with the older three-speed box, controlled using a column-mounted lever.  (Until the 1960s European cars in this class never offered the option of an automatic gear change.)  In the early years all the cars, regardless of equipment level, and whether saloon/sedan, or cabriolet bodied, came with a single bench seat across the full width of the car in place of the individual front seats fitted by most European manufacturers: this was a matter in respect of which the Taunus 12M was seen to reflect its manufacturer's North American parentage and thereby conferred a certain glamour at a time when the United States was a widely accepted role model across much of Europe and especially in West Germany.\n\nA maximum 38 PS/hp (28&nbsp;kW) of power was delivered to the rear wheels.  This was a useful increase on the {{convert|34|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} claimed for the previous model, and may have reflected a higher compression ratio and increases starting to come through across Europe in respect of available fuel octane levels.\n\nIn May 1953 the Taunus P1 finally became available with a four-speed gear box, though only as an optional extra.  It was also at this point that a 3-door kombi/estate version joined the range.  A cabriolet version had been offered since December 1952, being the result of a conversion by a coach building specialist based, like Ford, in the Cologne area and called [[:de: Karl Deutsch (Karosseriebau)|Karl Deutsch]]\n\n===Broadening the range===\nPoor workmanship on the early cars was a source of some disappointment.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{cite journal| authorlink = G\u00fcnther Zink  (verantwortlich)| title =Oldtimer Katalog| journal = | volume = 23| pages = 148|year = 2009|isbn = 978-3-86852-067-5|publisher=HEEL Verlag|location=K\u00f6nigswinter }}</ref>  Nevertheless, fairly soon (and in the absence of much direct competition during its early years on the German market) the Ford Taunus 12M, with its roomy modern body came to be seen as a high quality product, but on launch it was 37% more expensive than the 1952 price of the predecessor model.  By this time another 1200&nbsp;cc small car, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], was also gaining a foothold in the market place, and while the Volkswagen could not compete with the new Taunus 12M on cabin space, its lower price offered a compelling argument in a country still impoverished after the traumas of war and national defeat.   By the end of 1952 the old Taunus had disappeared from the Ford showrooms, and in December 1952 management decided to offer a stripped-down version of the new Taunus 12M, with all the chrome trimmings and various other \"unnecessary\" elements removed.  In place of the US-style front bench seat the basic version had two individual front seats which comprised simple non-adjustable steel frames with a thin coating of plastic fabric.  In place of the US-style column-mounted gear change the stripped-down version featured a gear lever in the middle of the floor between the two front seats:  this was considered very old fashioned at the time.  The basic Ford Taunus 12 was offered only as a two-door saloon/sedan.  The stripped down Taunus 12 nevertheless retailed at more than 10% less than the price of a Ford Taunus 12M.  And for only forty marks extra, the buyer of the basic car could upgrade his gear-change mechanism to the coveted column-mounted device.\n\n===Facelifts and upgrades===\nIn 1955 the Taunus 12M received its first facelift.  The formerly split chrome grill was replaced by a simplified single piece grill.  The prominent hemi-spherical globe design above the grill at this time remained in position, however.\nBy now the base price for the Ford Taunus 12M had been reduced to below 6,000 Marks, and with incomes on the rise nationally the stripped down Ford Taunus 12 was quietly dropped from the range.\n\nFrom 1957 the Taunus 12M joined other German automakers in offering the [[Semi-automatic transmission|automatic \u201cSaxomat\u201d clutch]] as an option\n\nIn 1958 the wide chrome bars of the radiator grill were replaced by a less flamboyant grill.  But the globe design directly above the grill lasted another year.\n\n===Taunus 15M (1955\u20131959)===\n[[File:Ford Taunus 15M.JPG|thumb|Ford Taunus 15M]]\nEarly in 1954 the Ford Taunus finally received the 1500&nbsp;cc engine that had been planned for successive Taunus models ever since 1939.  Hitherto the Ford Taunus 12M had competed as a large (if rather underpowered) car in the sector increasingly led by the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  Its size had always invited comparison with larger cars such as the [[Opel Olympia Rekord]], the [[Borgward Isabella]], the [[Fiat 1400]] and the [[Peugeot 403]].  What these cars had in common, however, was an engine of approximately 1500&nbsp;cc, which was something that till now the Taunus had conspicuously lacked.\n\nFord in Germany did not have the investment cash available to develop a new model of their own in the rapidly growing market segment of middle-sized (by the standards of the time and place) family cars, but by installing a 1498&nbsp;cc engine in the Taunus 12M they were able to announce almost as a new car the Ford Taunus 15M which could be profitably produced and sold alongside the car with which it shared virtually every component apart from the engine block and cosmetic touches, including a strongly differentiated front grill, intended to emphasize the differences between the cars to potential customers.\n\nThe new engine was based on the unit that had originally been developed with a side-mounted camshaft for launch in the 1939 [[Ford Taunus G93A|\u201cBuckeltaunus\u201d]].  Now, however, the originally planned side-valve configuration was replaced, for the first time on a German Ford, with [[ohv|an overhead camshaft]].  This reflected developments also underway in England where a new ohv-engined [[Ford Consul]] had appeared in 1951.  The crankshaft on the new German Ford engine was formed from tube rather than from a solid casting, which was seen as a way to save weight.\n\nThe Taunus 15M was offered with exactly the same choice of bodies as the 12M.  It was also offered with the option of a \"Saxomat\" automatic clutch, married to the three-speed gearbox (though not with the four-speed box).\n\n===Broadening the range more===\nIn September 1955, at the same as the Taunus 12M received its update, Ford also introduced a Taunus 15M de luxe.  This top-line model was identified by a particularly elaborate front grill and a two-tone paint scheme.  Various luxury features hitherto unavailable or else offered only as optional extras were included in the price for buyers of the Ford Taunus 15M de Luxe.  These included items such as the windscreen washer, reversing lights, tubeless tires, vanity mirrors in the sun visors and a headlamp flasher.  Many of these will have been regarded as relatively mainstream in North American cars, which will have added trans-Atlantic glamour to the Taunus 15M in a country where, especially in the south of Germany, the continuing presence of large numbers of [[US army|US troops]] enabled Ford's customers to be far more up to date than most other Europeans with trends in the US auto market.\n\nFollowing the 1958 facelift, the Taunus 15M and 12M, for the first time shared the same front grill: by now Ford management were evidently losing enthusiasm for the strategy of promoting the Taunus 15M, as far as possible, as though it was a separate model.\n\n==Side-stripes Taunus /\u201cSeitenstreifentaunus\u201d (1959\u20131962)==\n[[File:Ford P1 (Front 2011-09-24 Sp).JPG|thumb|right|Streifentaunus (1959 -1962)]]\nBy 1959, Ford's US management had decided that the earlier policy of selling as separate models the Taunus 12M and Taunus 15M no longer made sense.  This was partly in response to the lack of effectiveness with which the 15M model had been competing against [[Opel]].  General Motors were evidently cash rich at this time and Opel, between 1953 and 1957, offered an extensively redesigned or upgraded version of their [[Opel Olympia Rekord]] every year, and were dominating the middle-weight sedan sector of the German auto market.  However, another important game changer had been the introduction in 1957 of Ford's second new post-war model, the Project 2, known to customers at the time as the [[Ford Taunus P2|Ford Taunus 17M]].  The larger and flamboyantly styled Taunus 17M was seen{{By whom|date=November 2011}} as a much more powerful competitor to sell against the successful Opel and against the [[Borgward Isabella]], which acquired something approaching iconic status in the later 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFor 1959, Ford's smaller Taunus no longer needed to try to compete half a class up.  The Taunus 15M was withdrawn from sale.  A redesign of the front of the car saw the prominent globe symbol removed, leaving a more restrained front for the Taunus 12M which competed now without distraction in the small car category, a sector increasingly dominated  by [[Volkswagen]]\u2019s [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]].  Having lost its defining globe mascot, the smaller Taunus acquired a thick painted stripe down each side, slightly below the level of the car\u2019s waist.  It thereby acquired its \u201cSeitenstreifentaunus\u201d (Side-stripes Taunus) soubriquet.\n\nBy this time, the Ford Taunus 12M's twenty-five-year-old underpinnings were becoming uncomfortably obvious,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the car was having to compete largely on price.  However, that also meant that in terms of the amount of car offered for the money it represented something of a bargain.  The 1959 entry-level price of 5,555 marks was barely more than that asked for the much smaller and more cramped Volkswagen.<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/>\n\nAs Ford's management had feared, the arrival of newer models from competitor manufacturers was leaving the once fashionable Taunus 12M languishing in the sales charts.  Its once broad niche between the small relatively cramped Volkswagen and the growing class of middle-weights was under increasing pressure from entry-level versions of more recently introduced models from Opel, [[Fiat]] and [[Peugeot]].  In September 1959, with the 15M itself deleted from the range, Ford responded to the intensifying competition by offering the larger 1.5-litre engine from the 15M in the 12M for a supplementary payment of only 110 marks.  Cars with the larger engine were now identified simply by the name \u201cTaunus 12M Super\u201d.  The Taunus 15M name would not reappear until 1966 when it was needed for certain versions of the [[Ford Taunus P6]].\n\n==Replacement==\nBy 1961, despite its three-box body shape, the Taunus 12M had become outdated and outclassed, with an engine, suspension system and gear-box which still followed pretty closely their original 1935 designs.\n\nIn August 1962 production of the Taunus P1 came to an end, after 555,463 cars had been built.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The car was replaced by the Taunus P4 which retained the \u201cTaunus 12M\u201d name, but applied it to a Ford's first German built front-wheel drive model, powered by a modern compact V4 engine.\n\nDuring its three-year production run, between 1959 and 1962, 245,614 of the Stripes Taunus models were produced.  56,843 of these were fitted with the larger 1.5 liter motor.\n\n==Technical data==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!

It was marketed as the '''Ford Taunus 12M''', and, between 1955 and 1959, as the larger-engined '''Ford Taunus 15M'''. The company produced a succession of Ford Taunus 12M models until 1970, as the name was applied to a succession of similarly sized cars, but the first Taunus 12M models, based on the company's Taunus Project 1 (P1), remained in production only until 1962. In that year the Taunus P1 series was replaced by the [[Ford Taunus P4|Taunus P4]] series.\n\nAt its launch, the car placed Ford ahead of the pack, being unusually modern in terms of the bits that showed.  It was one of the first new cars to appear in Germany since before the [[Second World War|war]], and featured a radical [[ponton (automobile)|ponton]] format \u201cthree box\u201d body as pioneered (at least in Germany) by the 1949 [[Borgward Hansa 1500|Borgward]].  The three-box car body format would soon become mainstream, but when the Ford Taunus 12M appeared in 1952 competitor manufacturers including [[Opel]], [[Volkswagen]] and [[Auto Union]] were still competing with models based closely on designs originating in the 1930s.\n\n==Globe Taunus / \u201eWeltkugeltaunus\u201c (1952\u20131959)==\n\n===Development===\nPlanning for Ford Germany's new [[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]] bodied passenger car began in 1949.  Several aspects of the car's development reflected the advantages and the disadvantages of running a business with management decisions necessarily split between two continents at a time when even international telephone calls needed to be pre-booked.\n\nThe original plan for the strikingly modern design came from Ford in the USA who drew up a proposal based on the ponton format [[Studebaker Champion|Champion]] model introduced to the US auto-market a few years earlier by [[Studebaker]].  The Studebaker design had already proved highly influential on the domestic programs of mainstream US auto-makers.  Cologne based production engineers adapted the US proposal for the German market.  The Studebaker featured a large roundel directly above the front grill on which was displayed the propeller of an airplane.  The Ford Project 1 also featured a prominent roundel at the front of the car, but in place of the Studebaker's propeller design, the Ford roundel featured a hemispherical depiction of half a globe.  This bold and unusual decoration led to the new car becoming known as the \u201eWeltkugeltaunus\u201c (Globe Taunus).\n\nThe proposal from Ford in America called for a [[monocoque]] construction, following the lead (in Germany) of the 1937 [[Opel Olympia]].   Ford of Germany had no experience of this construction method, having spent most of the 1940s concentrating on building light trucks.  Project 1's predecessor, the Ford Taunus designed in the 1930s, had had its body built by an independent specialist pressed steel body builder in Berlin until 1948, and after the Berlin firm had its surviving plant crated up and shipped to the [[Soviet Union]], Ford had in 1948 been driven to having Ford Taunus bodies produced by competitors and specialists from northern Germany, [[Volkswagen]] and [[Karmann]].  Ford's Cologne management sought cooperation from other German auto-makers with developing the processes necessary for producing the monocoque Project 1 model, but the other German auto-makers had priorities of their own, and in the end it was with support from [[Ford SAF|Ford of France]] that the production lines for German Ford's project 1 were set up at the company's Cologne plant.\nIn due course, and not before a certain amount of confusion concerning the naming of the car,  Ford's Project 1 was released to the market as the Ford Taunus 12M.  It proved a success.  By the time the half globe was removed from the car's nose, 247,174 of the 12M version had been sold along with 127,942 of the subsequently introduced Ford Taunus 15Ms.\n\n===The name===\nThe naming of the car is another area which may have been complicated by the way that responsibilities were shared between different management teams in two continents divided by an eight-hour time difference and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The immediate postwar era was seen as a new beginning for a newly divided Germany with, in [[West Germany|the west]], new borders, a new constitution and a new political class.  The monocoque bodied new model for 1952 also represented a new beginning for Ford, so identifying it as Ford of Germany's Project 1 (P1) was evidently uncontentious.\n<div style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 29.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 0.86em; font-family: lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\">\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #999999; background: #ffffff; text-align: left; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: left;\">'' Ford Taunus 12M/15M production (units):<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 357</ref>\n:::* 1952      30,650 \n:::* 1953      35,888\n:::* 1954      42,631 \n:::* 1955      58,456\n:::* 1956      64,872 \n:::* 1957      50,734\n:::* 1958      29,688\n:::* 1959      52,648\n:::* 1960      94,408\n:::* 1961      61,474\n:::* 1962      34,014\n\n:Totals ( saloons/sedans & estates/kombis):<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 362 & 363</ref>\n:1952-1959 Taunus 12M 1.2L: 215,265\n:1954-1958 Taunus 15M 1.5L: 134,127\n:1959-1962 Taunus 12M 1.2L: 126,581\n:1959-1962 Taunus 12M 1.5L: 69,191\n\nNot included in these totals are the saloons/sedans converted into two seater cabriolets by the Cologne based coach builder Karl Deutsch.\n\n</div></div>\nIn the 1930s Ford of Germany had, along with [[Opel]], pioneered the use of model names that would have positive associations for customers.  While [[Auto Union]] customers were enticed to buy cars with names such as [[DKW F8]] and [[BMW]] were inviting customers to be seduced by names such as [[BMW 326]], Ford were selling the [[Ford K\u00f6ln]], named after a major cathedral city as well as the [[Ford Eifel]] and the [[Ford Taunus]] named after hilly areas of great natural beauty.  For Project 1, Ford Germany evidently intended to invoke another hilly region of natural beauty, and the name \u201cFord Hunsr\u00fcck\u201d was thought uncontroversial for a successor to the Ford Taunus.  However, the \u201cHunsr\u00fcck\u201d name was blocked shortly before launch, possibly because of problems encountered explaining the pronunciation of \u201cHunsr\u00fcck\u201d to management colleagues in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]].  This left the name Taunus, and it was proposed to name the new car \u201cTaunus 12 Meisterst\u00fcck\" in order to differentiate it from the existing [[Ford Taunus G73A|Ford Taunus]] which was by now an aging model that would nevertheless continue to be listed in parallel with the new model throughout most of 1952.  However, it transpired that the name \u201cMeisterst\u00fcck\u201d (''\"Masterpiece\"'') was unavailable for any Ford vehicle, having been patent-protected by a German bicycle manufacturer.  Therefore, by the time Ford's radical new car came to market it arrived under the name \u201cFord Taunus 12M\u201d.  The \u201c12\u201d in the name referred to the engine size of 1.2 litres and the \u201cM\u201d was the only part of the \u201cMeisterst\u00fcck\u201d name available to Ford.\n\n===The engines===\nDuring development it was intended that the car would be powered by a 1,498&nbsp;cc engine.  This was in many respects the engine that had originally been intended for the [[Ford Taunus G73A|previous Ford Taunus]] first produced in 1939, but now it was to be developed into an ohv unit.  However, cost constraints intervened, and when the new Taunus 12M appeared in 1952 it was powered by the 1,172&nbsp;cc side-valve unit that had powered not merely its predecessor, but also its predecessor's predecessor, the [[Ford Eifel]] of 1935.\n\nBy 1952 sidevalve engines were already seen as old fashioned.  In an analysis undertaken of the models shown at the 1952 [[Paris Motor Show]] it was noted that 48 of the cars exhibited were fitted with engines employing overhead valves while only 6 featured sidevalve engines.<ref name=Automobilia1953>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ren\u00e9 Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1953 (salon Paris oct 1952)| volume =  14| pages = 5|year = 2000|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>   That Ford were still powering their entry level Taunus P1 with a sidevalve engine ten years later, in 1962, would leave the model looking badly outclassed under the bonnet/hood.\n\n===The body and running gear===\nThe two-door modern slab sided Ford Taunus that appeared in January 1952 with an old fashioned engine married to a stylish new body was connected with the road using fashionably small 13\u201c wheels which will have saved on cost and maximised the space available for passengers and their luggage.  Individually suspended front wheels marked a contrast with the approach taken with the original Taunus, but in 1952 the rigid rear axle was all too familiar to Ford's existing German customers.\nThe old Taunus had acquired the option of a four-speed gear box in 1950, but the new model at its 1952 launch came only with the older three-speed box, controlled using a column-mounted lever.  (Until the 1960s European cars in this class never offered the option of an automatic gear change.)  In the early years all the cars, regardless of equipment level, and whether saloon/sedan, or cabriolet bodied, came with a single bench seat across the full width of the car in place of the individual front seats fitted by most European manufacturers: this was a matter in respect of which the Taunus 12M was seen to reflect its manufacturer's North American parentage and thereby conferred a certain glamour at a time when the United States was a widely accepted role model across much of Europe and especially in West Germany.\n\nA maximum 38 PS/hp (28&nbsp;kW) of power was delivered to the rear wheels.  This was a useful increase on the {{convert|34|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} claimed for the previous model, and may have reflected a higher compression ratio and increases starting to come through across Europe in respect of available fuel octane levels.\n\nIn May 1953 the Taunus P1 finally became available with a four-speed gear box, though only as an optional extra.  It was also at this point that a 3-door kombi/estate version joined the range.  A cabriolet version had been offered since December 1952, being the result of a conversion by a coach building specialist based, like Ford, in the Cologne area and called [[:de: Karl Deutsch (Karosseriebau)|Karl Deutsch]]\n\n===Broadening the range===\nPoor workmanship on the early cars was a source of some disappointment.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{cite journal| authorlink = G\u00fcnther Zink  (verantwortlich)| title =Oldtimer Katalog| journal = | volume = 23| pages = 148|year = 2009|isbn = 978-3-86852-067-5|publisher=HEEL Verlag|location=K\u00f6nigswinter }}</ref>  Nevertheless, fairly soon (and in the absence of much direct competition during its early years on the German market) the Ford Taunus 12M, with its roomy modern body came to be seen as a high quality product, but on launch it was 37% more expensive than the 1952 price of the predecessor model.  By this time another 1200&nbsp;cc small car, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], was also gaining a foothold in the market place, and while the Volkswagen could not compete with the new Taunus 12M on cabin space, its lower price offered a compelling argument in a country still impoverished after the traumas of war and national defeat.   By the end of 1952 the old Taunus had disappeared from the Ford showrooms, and in December 1952 management decided to offer a stripped-down version of the new Taunus 12M, with all the chrome trimmings and various other \"unnecessary\" elements removed.  In place of the US-style front bench seat the basic version had two individual front seats which comprised simple non-adjustable steel frames with a thin coating of plastic fabric.  In place of the US-style column-mounted gear change the stripped-down version featured a gear lever in the middle of the floor between the two front seats:  this was considered very old fashioned at the time.  The basic Ford Taunus 12 was offered only as a two-door saloon/sedan.  The stripped down Taunus 12 nevertheless retailed at more than 10% less than the price of a Ford Taunus 12M.  And for only forty marks extra, the buyer of the basic car could upgrade his gear-change mechanism to the coveted column-mounted device.\n\n===Facelifts and upgrades===\nIn 1955 the Taunus 12M received its first facelift.  The formerly split chrome grill was replaced by a simplified single piece grill.  The prominent hemi-spherical globe design above the grill at this time remained in position, however.\nBy now the base price for the Ford Taunus 12M had been reduced to below 6,000 Marks, and with incomes on the rise nationally the stripped down Ford Taunus 12 was quietly dropped from the range.\n\nFrom 1957 the Taunus 12M joined other German automakers in offering the [[Semi-automatic transmission|automatic \u201cSaxomat\u201d clutch]] as an option\n\nIn 1958 the wide chrome bars of the radiator grill were replaced by a less flamboyant grill.  But the globe design directly above the grill lasted another year.\n\n===Taunus 15M (1955\u20131959)===\n[[File:Ford Taunus 15M.JPG|thumb|Ford Taunus 15M]]\nEarly in 1954 the Ford Taunus finally received the 1500&nbsp;cc engine that had been planned for successive Taunus models ever since 1939.  Hitherto the Ford Taunus 12M had competed as a large (if rather underpowered) car in the sector increasingly led by the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  Its size had always invited comparison with larger cars such as the [[Opel Olympia Rekord]], the [[Borgward Isabella]], the [[Fiat 1400]] and the [[Peugeot 403]].  What these cars had in common, however, was an engine of approximately 1500&nbsp;cc, which was something that till now the Taunus had conspicuously lacked.\n\nFord in Germany did not have the investment cash available to develop a new model of their own in the rapidly growing market segment of middle-sized (by the standards of the time and place) family cars, but by installing a 1498&nbsp;cc engine in the Taunus 12M they were able to announce almost as a new car the Ford Taunus 15M which could be profitably produced and sold alongside the car with which it shared virtually every component apart from the engine block and cosmetic touches, including a strongly differentiated front grill, intended to emphasize the differences between the cars to potential customers.\n\nThe new engine was based on the unit that had originally been developed with a side-mounted camshaft for launch in the 1939 [[Ford Taunus G93A|\u201cBuckeltaunus\u201d]].  Now, however, the originally planned side-valve configuration was replaced, for the first time on a German Ford, with [[ohv|an overhead camshaft]].  This reflected developments also underway in England where a new ohv-engined [[Ford Consul]] had appeared in 1951.  The crankshaft on the new German Ford engine was formed from tube rather than from a solid casting, which was seen as a way to save weight.\n\nThe Taunus 15M was offered with exactly the same choice of bodies as the 12M.  It was also offered with the option of a \"Saxomat\" automatic clutch, married to the three-speed gearbox (though not with the four-speed box).\n\n===Broadening the range more===\nIn September 1955, at the same as the Taunus 12M received its update, Ford also introduced a Taunus 15M de luxe.  This top-line model was identified by a particularly elaborate front grill and a two-tone paint scheme.  Various luxury features hitherto unavailable or else offered only as optional extras were included in the price for buyers of the Ford Taunus 15M de Luxe.  These included items such as the windscreen washer, reversing lights, tubeless tires, vanity mirrors in the sun visors and a headlamp flasher.  Many of these will have been regarded as relatively mainstream in North American cars, which will have added trans-Atlantic glamour to the Taunus 15M in a country where, especially in the south of Germany, the continuing presence of large numbers of [[US army|US troops]] enabled Ford's customers to be far more up to date than most other Europeans with trends in the US auto market.\n\nFollowing the 1958 facelift, the Taunus 15M and 12M, for the first time shared the same front grill: by now Ford management were evidently losing enthusiasm for the strategy of promoting the Taunus 15M, as far as possible, as though it was a separate model.\n\n==Side-stripes Taunus /\u201cSeitenstreifentaunus\u201d (1959\u20131962)==\n[[File:Ford P1 (Front 2011-09-24 Sp).JPG|thumb|right|Streifentaunus (1959 -1962)]]\nBy 1959, Ford's US management had decided that the earlier policy of selling as separate models the Taunus 12M and Taunus 15M no longer made sense.  This was partly in response to the lack of effectiveness with which the 15M model had been competing against [[Opel]].  General Motors were evidently cash rich at this time and Opel, between 1953 and 1957, offered an extensively redesigned or upgraded version of their [[Opel Olympia Rekord]] every year, and were dominating the middle-weight sedan sector of the German auto market.  However, another important game changer had been the introduction in 1957 of Ford's second new post-war model, the Project 2, known to customers at the time as the [[Ford Taunus P2|Ford Taunus 17M]].  The larger and flamboyantly styled Taunus 17M was seen{{By whom|date=November 2011}} as a much more powerful competitor to sell against the successful Opel and against the [[Borgward Isabella]], which acquired something approaching iconic status in the later 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFor 1959, Ford's smaller Taunus no longer needed to try to compete half a class up.  The Taunus 15M was withdrawn from sale.  A redesign of the front of the car saw the prominent globe symbol removed, leaving a more restrained front for the Taunus 12M which competed now without distraction in the small car category, a sector increasingly dominated  by [[Volkswagen]]\u2019s [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]].  Having lost its defining globe mascot, the smaller Taunus acquired a thick painted stripe down each side, slightly below the level of the car\u2019s waist.  It thereby acquired its \u201cSeitenstreifentaunus\u201d (Side-stripes Taunus) soubriquet.\n\nBy this time, the Ford Taunus 12M's twenty-five-year-old underpinnings were becoming uncomfortably obvious,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the car was having to compete largely on price.  However, that also meant that in terms of the amount of car offered for the money it represented something of a bargain.  The 1959 entry-level price of 5,555 marks was barely more than that asked for the much smaller and more cramped Volkswagen.<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/>\n\nAs Ford's management had feared, the arrival of newer models from competitor manufacturers was leaving the once fashionable Taunus 12M languishing in the sales charts.  Its once broad niche between the small relatively cramped Volkswagen and the growing class of middle-weights was under increasing pressure from entry-level versions of more recently introduced models from Opel, [[Fiat]] and [[Peugeot]].  In September 1959, with the 15M itself deleted from the range, Ford responded to the intensifying competition by offering the larger 1.5-litre engine from the 15M in the 12M for a supplementary payment of only 110 marks.  Cars with the larger engine were now identified simply by the name \u201cTaunus 12M Super\u201d.  The Taunus 15M name would not reappear until 1966 when it was needed for certain versions of the [[Ford Taunus P6]].\n\n==Replacement==\nBy 1961, despite its three-box body shape, the Taunus 12M had become outdated and outclassed, with an engine, suspension system and gear-box which still followed pretty closely their original 1935 designs.\n\nIn August 1962 production of the Taunus P1 came to an end, after 555,463 cars had been built.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The car was replaced by the Taunus P4 which retained the \u201cTaunus 12M\u201d name, but applied it to a Ford's first German built front-wheel drive model, powered by a modern compact V4 engine.\n\nDuring its three-year production run, between 1959 and 1962, 245,614 of the Stripes Taunus models were produced.  56,843 of these were fitted with the larger 1.5 liter motor.\n\n==Technical data==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!

Various logos incorporating a leaping deer have been used by the company for over 155 years.\n\n== 19th century ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017|talk=[[Talk:John Deere/Archives/2017#19th century section needs additional citations]]|small=yes}}\nDeere & Company began when [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]], born in [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]], United States on February 7, 1804, moved to [[Grand Detour, Illinois]] in 1836 to escape [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in [[Vermont]]. Already an established [[blacksmith]], Deere opened a {{convert|1378|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of tools such as pitchforks and shovels.\nTools were just a start; the item that set him apart was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so they had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.\n\nIn 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] in Illinois. This factory, named the \"L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer\", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to [[Moline, Illinois]], to have access to the railroad and the [[Mississippi River]]. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a {{convert|1440|sqft|m2|adj=on}} factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate & Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.\n[[File:John Deere logo 1876-1912.jpg|thumb|200px|Company logo used between 1876 and 1912]]\nDeere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son [[Charles Deere]]. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere & Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide. This same year, Deere & Company won \"Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety\" at the 17th Annual [[Illinois State Fair]], for which it won $10 and a Silver Medal.<ref name=Reynolds>Reynolds, John P. \"Transactions of the Illinois State Agricultural Society, with Reports from County and District Agricultural Societies\", Illinois Journal Printing Office, 1871, pg. 43,</ref>\n\nThe core focus remained on the agricultural implements, but John Deere also made a few bicycles in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.qconline.com/life/john-deere-collectors-center-tractor-and-memorabilia-auction-june/article_1229dbed-c052-5dbd-a59e-775215b895a6.html|title=John Deere Collectors Center Tractor and Memorabilia Auction June 29 \u2013 30|work=Dispatch-Argus-QCOnline|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== 20th century ==\n[[File:NOLA1903JohnDeerePlowHouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Deere Plow & Cultivators Co.'s [[New Orleans]] House, 1903]]\nIncreased competition during the early [[1900s (decade)|1900s]] from the new [[International Harvester Company]] led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of gasoline tractors came to define Deere & Company's operations during the 20th century.\n[[File:John Deere logo 1912-1936.jpg|thumb|200px|Company logo used between 1912 and 1936]] \nIn 1912, Deere & Company president [[William Butterworth (businessman)|William Butterworth]] (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] in 1918, which manufactured the popular [[Waterloo Boy]] tractor at its facilities in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the [http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/000/0/2/23-john-deere-d.html John Deere Model D] was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.\n\nThe company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.<ref name=\"blog.machinefinder.com\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.machinefinder.com/16329/john-deere-combine-history|title=A Brief Look at John Deere Combine History: 86 Years of Evolution|publisher=blog.machinefinder.com|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nOn an episode of the [[Travel Channel]] series ''Made in America'' that profiled Deere & Company, host [[John Ratzenberger]] stated that the company never [[Repossession|repossessed]] any equipment from American farmers during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/pure-genius-the-inventors-hall-of-fame-785519.html Pure genius: the inventor's hall of fame].

Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the \"New Generation of Power\", the company's first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The [[Dallas Memorial Auditorium]], the [[Texas State Fairgrounds]] Coliseum, the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]], and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside [[Neiman-Marcus]], a popular Dallas-based department store.\n\nAccording to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the \"largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted.\" During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see \"a line\nof entirely new tractors \u2013 completely modern in every respect \u2013 with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor.\"\n\nSince entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.<ref name=\"deere\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/Corporate/fans_visitors/publications/plowshare_issue14.pdf|date=27 March 2009|journal=The Plowshare|title=A Big Day for Deere|volume=14|pages=1\u20136|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe [[John Deere 4010|4010]] was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the [[John Deere 4020|4020]], which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere's optional [[John Deere Powershift transmission|Power Shift]], enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.\n\nIn addition to the advanced engine technology, the \"10\" series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the \"10\" series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the \"10\" series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/000/0/6/61-john-deere-4010.html|title=TractorData.com John Deere 4010 tractor information|author=Peter Easterlund|work=tractordata.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tractorfriends.org/history/jd10series/jd1010series.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025720/http://www.tractorfriends.org/history/jd10series/jd1010series.html |archivedate=2015-06-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.com/machinery/tractors/antique-tractor/john-deere-4010_201-ar15646|title=John Deere 4010|work=agriculture.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Deere introduced its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body.  This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An [[8-track tape]] player was also available as an option.  The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horses' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840.  The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.\n\nIn 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850.  These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed Power Shift transmission, and were available with optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius.  They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, instead of the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by the Deere's completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total work force of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:\n*John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements \n*John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment \n*John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings\n*John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements *John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements\n*John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements\n\nThe John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population.<ref>Illinois Manufacturers Directory, Manufacturers' News, Inc. Chicago, IL, copyright 1962, p. 1503, 1594\u20131595</ref>\n\nIn 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combine imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.\n\nIn 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]]. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, [[Power take-off|PTO]] shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://farmindustrynews.com/show-me-rotaries|title=Show me the rotaries|date=1999-07-01|work=Farm Industry News|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s, [[International Harvester]] had pioneered rotary combines with their [[Axial flow]] machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.<ref name=\"blog.machinefinder.com\"/>\n<!-- {{Incomplete|section|date=October 2011}} -->\n\n== 21st century ==\n{{As of|2018}}, Deere & Company employed about 67,000 people worldwide, of which half are in the United States and Canada, and is the largest agriculture machinery company in the world.

Various logos incorporating a leaping deer have been used by the company for over 155 years.\n\n== 19th century ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017|talk=[[Talk:John Deere/Archives/2017#19th century section needs additional citations]]|small=yes}}\nDeere & Company began when [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]], born in [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]], United States on February 7, 1804, moved to [[Grand Detour, Illinois]] in 1836 to escape [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in [[Vermont]]. Already an established [[blacksmith]], Deere opened a {{convert|1378|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of tools such as pitchforks and shovels.\nTools were just a start; the item that set him apart was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so they had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.\n\nIn 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] in Illinois. This factory, named the \"L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer\", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to [[Moline, Illinois]], to have access to the railroad and the [[Mississippi River]]. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a {{convert|1440|sqft|m2|adj=on}} factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate & Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.\n[[File:John Deere logo 1876-1912.jpg|thumb|200px|Company logo used between 1876 and 1912]]\nDeere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son [[Charles Deere]]. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere & Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide.

Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] in 1918, which manufactured the popular [[Waterloo Boy]] tractor at its facilities in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the [http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/000/0/2/23-john-deere-d.html John Deere Model D] was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.\n\nThe company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.<ref name=\"blog.machinefinder.com\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.machinefinder.com/16329/john-deere-combine-history|title=A Brief Look at John Deere Combine History: 86 Years of Evolution|publisher=blog.machinefinder.com|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nOn an episode of the [[Travel Channel]] series ''Made in America'' that profiled Deere & Company, host [[John Ratzenberger]] stated that the company never [[Repossession|repossessed]] any equipment from American farmers during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/pure-genius-the-inventors-hall-of-fame-785519.html Pure genius: the inventor's hall of fame].

Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the \"New Generation of Power\", the company's first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The [[Dallas Memorial Auditorium]], the [[Texas State Fairgrounds]] Coliseum, the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]], and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside [[Neiman-Marcus]], a popular Dallas-based department store.\n\nAccording to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the \"largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted.\" During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see \"a line\nof entirely new tractors \u2013 completely modern in every respect \u2013 with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor.\"\n\nSince entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.<ref name=\"deere\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/Corporate/fans_visitors/publications/plowshare_issue14.pdf|date=27 March 2009|journal=The Plowshare|title=A Big Day for Deere|volume=14|pages=1\u20136|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe [[John Deere 4010|4010]] was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the [[John Deere 4020|4020]], which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere's optional [[John Deere Powershift transmission|Power Shift]], enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.\n\nIn addition to the advanced engine technology, the \"10\" series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the \"10\" series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the \"10\" series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/000/0/6/61-john-deere-4010.html|title=TractorData.com John Deere 4010 tractor information|author=Peter Easterlund|work=tractordata.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tractorfriends.org/history/jd10series/jd1010series.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025720/http://www.tractorfriends.org/history/jd10series/jd1010series.html |archivedate=2015-06-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.com/machinery/tractors/antique-tractor/john-deere-4010_201-ar15646|title=John Deere 4010|work=agriculture.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Deere introduced its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body.  This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An [[8-track tape]] player was also available as an option.  The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horses' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840.  The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.\n\nIn 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850.  These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed Power Shift transmission, and were available with optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius.  They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, instead of the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by the Deere's completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total work force of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:\n*John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements \n*John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment \n*John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings\n*John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements *John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements\n*John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements\n\nThe John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population.<ref>Illinois Manufacturers Directory, Manufacturers' News, Inc. Chicago, IL, copyright 1962, p. 1503, 1594\u20131595</ref>\n\nIn 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combine imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.\n\nIn 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]]. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, [[Power take-off|PTO]] shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://farmindustrynews.com/show-me-rotaries|title=Show me the rotaries|date=1999-07-01|work=Farm Industry News|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s, [[International Harvester]] had pioneered rotary combines with their [[Axial flow]] machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Linus Tech]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

In the letter, he suggested that the board would be responsible for formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the international matches between the three members: Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey, wanted to host a Triangular Test series between the participant countries in South Africa. Australia rejected the offer. However, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during the Australia's tour of England in 1909.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped.

This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments.

As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations \u2013 as of June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations \u2013 as of June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/top-stories/32440276_1_drs-ball-tracking-icc-executive-board| title= No decision yet on universal application of DRS\n|work=Times of India |date=27 June 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/top-stories/32617106_1_expert-in-computer-vision-icc-management-decision-review-system| title= Research on DRS to be shown to BCCI\n| date= 10 July 2012 |work=Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ireland and Afghanistan ICC newest full members amid wide-ranging governance reform|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/422449|website=icc-cricket.com|publisher=ICC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Regional bodies==\nThese regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket:\n* [[African Cricket Association]]\n* [[Asian Cricket Council]]\n* [[ICC Americas]]\n* [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]]\n* [[European Cricket Council]]\n\nTwo further regional bodies were disestablished following the creation of the African Cricket Association:\n* [[East and Central Africa Cricket Council]]\n* [[West Africa Cricket Council]]\n\n==Competitions and awards==\n{{Main|International cricket}}\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n* [[ICC Test Championship]] (Notional league for Test rankings)\n* [[ICC ODI Championship]] (Notional league for ODI rankings)\n* [[ICC T20I Championship]] (Notional league for T20I rankings)\n\n=== Tournaments ===\nThe ICC organises various international '''''test''''', '''''one-day''''' and '''''Twenty20''''' cricket competitions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Format\n! colspan=\"2\" |Men\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Women\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Youth\n|-\n!Full Members\n!Associates Members\n|-\n|[[Test cricket|Test]]\n|[[ICC World Test Championship]]\n|[[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] (defunct)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[One-day cricket|One-day]]\n|[[Cricket World Cup|ICC Cricket World Cup]]\n|[[ICC World Cricket League]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Women's Cricket World Cup]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Under-19 Cricket World Cup|ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]\n|-\n|[[ICC Champions Trophy]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's Championship]]\n|-\n|[[2020\u201322_ICC_Cricket_World_Cup_Super_League|ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]]\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup League 2]]<br />[[ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Twenty20]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's T20 World Cup]]\n|\n|}\nThe ICC has instituted the '''[[ICC Awards]]''' to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months.

Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal [[bookmaking]] markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], [[Paul Condon, Baron Condon|Lord Condon]]. Among the corruption on which they have reported was that of former [[South African national cricket captains|South African captain]] [[Hansie Cronje]] who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively).  The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced, which for example prohibit the use of [[mobile telephone]]s in [[Changeroom|dressing room]]s.\n\nPrior to the 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]] ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |work=The Jamaica Star |title=Speed warns against corruption during World Cup |date=13 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201121545/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|scandal that occurred]] during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3 Pakistani players, [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] and [[Salman Butt]] were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively.
