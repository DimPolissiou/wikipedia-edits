Unusually, they tend to lack attachment structures and form gamont pairs that pulsate freely within the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]].\n\nMonocystids are aseptate eugregarines that infect the reproductive vesicles of terrestrial [[annelid]]s. These latter species tend to branch closely with [[neogregarines]] and may need to be reclassified.  Generally, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Neogregarines''' are found only in terrestrial hosts. These species have reduced trophozoites and tend to infect tissues other than the intestine. Usually, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\nThe eugregarines and neogregarines differ in a number of respects. The neogregarines are in general more pathogenic to their hosts. The eugregarines multiply by sporogony and gametogony, while the neogregarines have an additional schizogenic stage \u2014 merogony \u2014 within their hosts. Merogony may be intracellular or extracellular depending on the species.\n\nDNA studies suggest the [[archigregarines]] are ancestral to the others.<ref name=Leander2008>{{cite journal |author=Leander BS |title=Marine gregarines: evolutionary prelude to the apicomplexan radiation? |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=60\u20137 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18226585 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2007.11.005 }}</ref>\n\n===Proposed revisions===\n\nCavalier-Smith has proposed a significant revision of this taxon assuming the [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|polyphyly]] of [[Eugregarinorida|eugregarine]]s.<ref name=Cavalier-Smith2014>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Gregarine site-heterogeneous 18S rDNA trees, revision of gregarine higher classification, and the evolutionary diversification of Sporozoa |journal=Eur.

Downtown Industrial District''' (LADID) is manufacturing and wholesale district of downtown Los Angeles, California, that was established as a property-based [[business improvement district]] (BID) in 1998 by the Central City East Association (CCEA). The district spans 46 blocks, covers 600 properties, and is the historic home of seafood, produce, flowers, and a variety of products daily shipped in and out of Los Angeles by air, rail, and sea. The LADID hosts the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, the second largest produce market in the United States. \n\n==Boundaries==\n\nThe LADID is bounded on the West by [[San Pedro Street]] from 8th Street to 7th Street and both sides of San Pedro from 7th Street to Third Street, on the North by Third Street, on the East by [[Alameda Street]], and on the South by [[Olympic Boulevard]] and 8th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.cityofla.acsitefactory.com/sites/g/files/wph606/f/LACITYP_025495.pdf|title=Downtown Industrial District Business Improvement District Engineer's Report|publisher=Los Angeles City Clerk|website=clerk.lacity.org|date=May 2014|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Zones===\n\nThe [[business improvement district]] (BID) is divided into two distinct benefits zones. Zone One is composed of small parcels with buildings with street fronts that typically house multiple businesses. Zone Two consists of larger parcels with buildings that are set back, are completely fenced, and house only one business.\n\nZone One parcels are predominately occupied by small wholesale businesses with some retail uses that primarily serve the needs of the immediate neighborhood within the District. Zone One also contains a number of non-profit social service providers. Zone One has the highest pedestrian counts and the highest demand for clean and safe services based on data from over 10 years of operation. The west boundary for zone one is the west boundary for the District. The north boundary is 3rd Street. The east boundary is Central Avenue and the south boundary is 8th Street.\n\nZone Two is predominately wholesale, industrial and market uses, including the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, which have very little pedestrian traffic and operate predominately during the night hours. Zone Two has a much lower historical demand for clean and safe services based on data from over 10 years of operations. The west boundary for Zone Two is Central Avenue. The north boundary is 3rd Street. The east boundary is Alameda Street and the south boundary is Olympic Boulevard.\n\n==Business improvement district==\n\nThe Los Angeles Downtown Industrial District Business Improvement District (BID) serves as the principal advocate for property owners, businesses, employees and residents of the LADID. Services, activities, and programs that are not provided by the City of Los Angeles are paid for through a special assessment which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide public safety patrols, street cleaning and maintenance services as well as economic development and communications. \n\nThe BID is administered by the Central City East Association (CCEA), overseen by a board of directors composed of property owners, and managed on a day-to-day basis by a two-person management team.\n\n==Homeless population==\n\nThe LADID is host to one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States. As such, the neighborhood has become the region\u2019s center for services for the homeless, the mentally ill, and persons looking to find emergency shelter and assistance. More than two dozen historic hotels within the district have been converted into low-income housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2016/3/1/10942504/downtown-la-skid-row-industrial-district-gentrification|title=Skid Row Braces as Downtown LA's Industrial District Makes Plans to Gentrify|first=Jeff|last=Wattenhofer|publisher=Vox Media|website=[[Curbed]]|date=9 February 2016|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/298031608/CCEA-Planning-Study-November-2015| title=Central City East Association Planning Study|author=AECOM|publisher=[[AECOM]]|website=[[Scribd]]|date=November 2015|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\nThe LADID makes up 10% of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]\u2019s total geography and 1 to 2% of Downtown\u2019s employment.

Downtown Industrial District''' (LADID) is manufacturing and wholesale district of downtown Los Angeles, California, that was established as a property-based [[business improvement district]] (BID) in 1998 by the Central City East Association (CCEA). The district spans 46 blocks, covers 600 properties, and is the historic home of seafood, produce, flowers, and a variety of products daily shipped in and out of Los Angeles by air, rail, and sea. The LADID hosts the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, the second largest produce market in the United States. \n\n==Boundaries==\n\nThe LADID is bounded on the West by [[San Pedro Street]] from 8th Street to 7th Street and both sides of San Pedro from 7th Street to Third Street, on the North by Third Street, on the East by [[Alameda Street]], and on the South by [[Olympic Boulevard]] and 8th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.cityofla.acsitefactory.com/sites/g/files/wph606/f/LACITYP_025495.pdf|title=Downtown Industrial District Business Improvement District Engineer's Report|publisher=Los Angeles City Clerk|website=clerk.lacity.org|date=May 2014|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Zones===\n\nThe [[business improvement district]] (BID) is divided into two distinct benefits zones. Zone One is composed of small parcels with buildings with street fronts that typically house multiple businesses. Zone Two consists of larger parcels with buildings that are set back, are completely fenced, and house only one business.\n\nZone One parcels are predominately occupied by small wholesale businesses with some retail uses that primarily serve the needs of the immediate neighborhood within the District. Zone One also contains a number of non-profit social service providers. Zone One has the highest pedestrian counts and the highest demand for clean and safe services based on data from over 10 years of operation. The west boundary for zone one is the west boundary for the District. The north boundary is 3rd Street. The east boundary is Central Avenue and the south boundary is 8th Street.\n\nZone Two is predominately wholesale, industrial and market uses, including the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, which have very little pedestrian traffic and operate predominately during the night hours. Zone Two has a much lower historical demand for clean and safe services based on data from over 10 years of operations. The west boundary for Zone Two is Central Avenue. The north boundary is 3rd Street. The east boundary is Alameda Street and the south boundary is Olympic Boulevard.\n\n==Business improvement district==\n\nThe Los Angeles Downtown Industrial District Business Improvement District (BID) serves as the principal advocate for property owners, businesses, employees and residents of the LADID. Services, activities, and programs that are not provided by the City of Los Angeles are paid for through a special assessment which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide public safety patrols, street cleaning and maintenance services as well as economic development and communications. \n\nThe BID is administered by the Central City East Association (CCEA), overseen by a board of directors composed of property owners, and managed on a day-to-day basis by a two-person management team.\n\n==Homeless population==\n\nThe LADID is host to one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States. As such, the neighborhood has become the region\u2019s center for services for the homeless, the mentally ill, and persons looking to find emergency shelter and assistance. More than two dozen historic hotels within thw district have been converted into low-income housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2016/3/1/10942504/downtown-la-skid-row-industrial-district-gentrification|title=Skid Row Braces as Downtown LA's Industrial District Makes Plans to Gentrify|first=Jeff|last=Wattenhofer|publisher=Vox Media|website=[[Curbed]]|date=9 February 2016|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/298031608/CCEA-Planning-Study-November-2015| title=Central City East Association Planning Study|author=AECOM|publisher=[[AECOM]]|website=[[Scribd]]|date=November 2015|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\nThe LADID makes up 10% of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]\u2019s total geography and 1 to 2% of Downtown\u2019s employment.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay is garbage.\n\n<br />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot beyond this. Thank you. -->\n[[Doctor Eggman]] kidnaps Princess Elise of Soleanna in the hopes of harnessing the Flames of Disaster, a destructive power sealed within her. Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay is garbage.\n\n.<ref name=\"dlc\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot beyond this. Thank you. -->\n[[Doctor Eggman]] kidnaps Princess Elise of Soleanna in the hopes of harnessing the Flames of Disaster, a destructive power sealed within her. Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli).

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also refered to as the tri-layered structure.
