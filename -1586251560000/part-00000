He is best known for voicing [[Mario]] in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' video game series. Martinet has voiced this title character of [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] flagship video game franchise since 1990, and he also voices related characters such as Baby Mario, [[Luigi]], Baby Luigi, [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]].\n\n==Early life==\nMartinet is of [[French American|French descent]] and speaks fluent [[French language|French]]<ref>{{YouTube|6YvXRxbkOgE|Interview in French for Express magazine}}</ref> and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. His family moved to [[Barcelona]] when he was 12 years old, and later to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"SacAnime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacanime.com/?page_id=5436|title=CHARLES MARTINET|website=SacAnime|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref> He attended the [[American School of Paris]] and graduated in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title=American School of Paris Aspire|date=1974}}</ref>\n\nMartinet attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he originally intended to study [[international law]]. In his senior year he decided to discontinue his studies after a tutor told him to \"regurgitate information he'd written in his book, chapter-by-chapter\". A friend suggested to him to take acting classes to combat his [[fear of public speaking]]. His first role was a monologue from the ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]''.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/> Eventually, Martinet earned an apprenticeship at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]. After training with the Berkeley Rep for several years, Martinet went to [[London]] to attend the [[Drama Studio London]], where among other skills, he discovered his talent for [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[dialect]]s.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/> Upon returning to California he joined the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. He went on to become a founding member of the [[San Jose Repertory Theatre]] for four years.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\n==Career==\nWorking for [[Nintendo]] since 1990, Martinet started voicing [[Mario]] at video game [[Trade|trade shows]] in which attendees would walk up to a TV screen displaying a 3-D Mario head that moved around the screen and talked.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19664003|title=The actors hiding inside your video games|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=30 September 2012|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref> This system was called Mario in Real-Time or MIRT and was developed by [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] based SimGraphics.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Martinet could see the attendees by means of a hidden camera setup, and a facial [[motion capture]] rig recorded his mouth movements in order to synchronize Martinet's mouth movement with the on-screen Mario mouth movement. This [[digital puppetry]], with Martinet's comic performance, was a novelty at the time.\n\nMartinet earned the job when, one day, he was told by his friend that there was going to be an audition at a trade show in which auditioneers \"talk to people as a plumber\". He went to the audition at the last minute as the casting directors were already putting away their equipment. Charles Martinet walked in and asked, \"Can I please read for this?\". The directors let him [[audition]] and told him, \"You're an Italian plumber from [[Brooklyn]]\". At first Martinet planned to talk like a [[stereotypical]] [[Italian American]] with a deep, raspy voice (which is how Mario sounded in the ''[[Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' cartoons). He then thought to himself that it would be too harsh for children to hear, so he made it more soft-hearted and friendly, resulting in what Mario's voice is today. Martinet has also stated that he kept on talking with his Mario voice until the audition tape ran out.<ref>{{YouTube|id=r4Eudb_Tqg8#t=2m20s|title=The Voice of Mario - Charles Martinet Interview}} (at 2:20 mark)</ref> He says that [[Petruchio]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' was an inspiration for his portrayal of Mario.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nMartinet's video game voice over debut was as Mario in the 1995 Windows release of [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s game ''[[Mario's Game Gallery|Mario's FUNdamentals]]''. However, most were first exposed to Mario's voice in the landmark 1996 game ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. During the recording session, he and a few developers wondered what Mario would do when the player leaves him alone. In the end, Martinet came up with the idea that Mario would dream of pasta during his sleep and Mario says \"night nighty. Ahhh spaghetti, ahhh ravioli, ahhh mamma mia.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Super Mario 64: Mario Sleeping|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UEAQll3W28|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> when Mario is in his second sleeping position.<ref name=\"mariosleeping\">{{cite web|title=Mario 64 - Mario Sleeping|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UEAQll3W28|website=YouTube|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> He has voiced Mario, Luigi, [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], Toadsworth, Metal Mario, Shadow Mario,<ref name=\"charlesmartinet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlesmartinet.com/voiceover.html|title=Charles Martinet--Voice Over|website=www.charlesmartinet.com}}</ref> Piantas (Male), Mini-Mario Toys, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and Baby Wario in most games wherein these characters speak. He also voiced the enemies Wart, Mouser, Tryclyde, and Clawgrip in ''[[Super Mario Advance]]''. His voice work appears in the English and [[Japanese language]] versions of the games. With his work as Mario in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] recognized Martinet for having performed the same character in one hundred different titles, the most of any video game voice actor.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://news.avclub.com/charles-martinet-now-holds-a-guinness-record-for-voicin-1831124428 | title = Charles Martinet now holds a Guinness record for voicing Super Mario 100 times  | first = Sam | last = Barsanti | date = December 15, 2018 | accessdate = December 17, 2018 | work = [[The A.V.

He voiced the character Vigoro in [[Sega]]'s [[Dreamcast]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] [[role-playing video game]], ''[[Skies of Arcadia]]''. He did the voice of   Homunculus in the Konami [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and Windows game ''[[Shadow of Destiny]]'', and provided voices for ''[[Reader Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The ClueFinders]]'' games. Charles Martinet wanted to voice [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', but [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] told him that Link would remain without a voice. However Link's grunts have been voiced by various Japanese voice actors.\n\nIn addition to video game voice overs, Martinet has worked as a voice actor in commercials, cartoons, and promotions.

Martinet did Mario's voice as the announcer for ''[[Pac-Man Vs.]]'' on the Nintendo GameCube.\n\nOther than the ''Mario'' series, Charles has also done work for the video game ''[[Cel Damage]]'' as the voice of Fowl Mouth, as well as the primary voice work in several educational game series such as [[LeapFrog Enterprises|LeapFrog]].<ref name=\"charlesmartinet\"/> He also voiced the dragon Paarthurnax in the 2011 video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', Orvus in 2009's ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]'', and narrated the cutscenes and menus for the 2013 video game ''[[Runner2]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaijingames.com/blog-post/what-flavor |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122230643/http://gaijingames.com/blog-post/what-flavor |archivedate=2013-01-22 }}</ref> and ''[[Runner3]]'', appearing as a hidden playable character in the latter.\n\n==Public appearances==\nAs the voice of Mario, Martinet has become a well-known personality and has made public appearances at several video game related events where he meets fans for chat, photographs, and autographs.

He is best known for voicing [[Mario]] in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' video game series. Martinet has voiced this title character of [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] flagship video game franchise since 1990, and he also voices related characters such as Baby Mario, [[Luigi]], Baby Luigi, [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]].\n\n==Early life==\nMartinet is of [[French American|French descent]] and speaks fluent [[French language|French]]<ref>{{YouTube|6YvXRxbkOgE|Interview in French for Express magazine}}</ref> and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. His family moved to [[Barcelona]] when he was 12 years old, and later to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"SacAnime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacanime.com/?page_id=5436|title=CHARLES MARTINET|website=SacAnime|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref> He attended the [[American School of Paris]] and graduated in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title=American School of Paris Aspire|date=1974}}</ref>\n\nMartinet attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he originally intended to study [[international law]]. In his senior year he decided to discontinue his studies after a tutor told him to \"regurgitate information he'd written in his book, chapter-by-chapter\". A friend suggested to him to take acting classes to combat his [[fear of public speaking]]. His first role was a monologue from the ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]''.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/> Eventually, Martinet earned an apprenticeship at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]. After training with the Berkeley Rep for several years, Martinet went to [[London]] to attend the [[Drama Studio London]], where among other skills, he discovered his talent for [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[dialect]]s.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/> Upon returning to California he joined the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. He went on to become a founding member of the [[San Jose Repertory Theatre]] for four years.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\n==Career==\nWorking for [[Nintendo]] since 1990, Martinet started voicing [[Mario]] at video game [[Trade|trade shows]] in which attendees would walk up to a TV screen displaying a 3-D Mario head that moved around the screen and talked.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19664003|title=The actors hiding inside your video games|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=30 September 2012|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref> This system was called Mario in Real-Time or MIRT and was developed by [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] based SimGraphics.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Martinet could see the attendees by means of a hidden camera setup, and a facial [[motion capture]] rig recorded his mouth movements in order to synchronize Martinet's mouth movement with the on-screen Mario mouth movement. This [[digital puppetry]], with Martinet's comic performance, was a novelty at the time.\n\nMartinet earned the job when, one day, he was told by his friend that there was going to be an audition at a trade show in which auditioneers \"talk to people as a plumber\". He went to the audition at the last minute as the casting directors were already putting away their equipment. Charles Martinet walked in and asked, \"Can I please read for this?\". The directors let him [[audition]] and told him, \"You're an Italian plumber from [[Brooklyn]]\". At first Martinet planned to talk like a [[stereotypical]] [[Italian American]] with a deep, raspy voice (which is how Mario sounded in the ''[[Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' cartoons). He then thought to himself that it would be too harsh for children to hear, so he made it more soft-hearted and friendly, resulting in what Mario's voice is today. Martinet has also stated that he kept on talking with his Mario voice until the audition tape ran out.<ref>{{YouTube|id=r4Eudb_Tqg8#t=2m20s|title=The Voice of Mario - Charles Martinet Interview}} (at 2:20 mark)</ref> He says that [[Petruchio]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' was an inspiration for his portrayal of Mario.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nMartinet's video game voice over debut was as Mario in the 1995 Windows release of [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s game ''[[Mario's Game Gallery|Mario's FUNdamentals]]''. However, most were first exposed to Mario's voice in the landmark 1996 game ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. During the recording session, he and a few developers wondered what Mario would do when the player leaves him alone. In the end, Martinet came up with the idea that Mario would dream of pasta during his sleep and Mario says \"night nighty.
