The first flight was [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] flight IB187 from Lanzarote, which was operated by a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] landing at 10:17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=TFS&c=Page&cid=1048146821188&pagename=subHome|title=History Tenerife South Airport|website=Aena.es|accessdate=2012-09-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307121644/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=TFS&c=Page&cid=1048146821188&pagename=subHome|archivedate=2012-03-07}}</ref> By the end of its first year, 1 million passengers had passed through its doors.\n\n==Terminal==\nTenerife South consists of one three-storey passenger terminal in a classic brick style. The main level, Floor 0, contains all check-in and service counters, the departures waiting areas as well as the arrivals and main baggage reclaim. The departures area features 34 boarding gates of which eight are equipped with [[jetbridge]]s. While the upper floor 1 contains office space and transit corridors, the basement level -1 features additional luggage belts.<ref>{{cite

The first flight was [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] flight IB187 from Lanzarote, which was operated by a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] landing at 10:17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=TFS&c=Page&cid=1048146821188&pagename=subHome|title=History Tenerife South Airport|website=Aena.es|accessdate=2012-09-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307121644/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=TFS&c=Page&cid=1048146821188&pagename=subHome|archivedate=2012-03-07}}</ref> By the end of its first year, 1 million passengers had passed through its doors.\n\n==Terminal==\nTenerife South consists of one three-storey passenger terminal in a classic brick style. The main level, Floor 0, contains all check-in and service counters, the departures waiting areas as well as the arrivals and main baggage reclaim. The departures area features 34 boarding gates of which eight are equipped with [[jetbridge]]s. While the upper floor 1 contains office space and transit corridors, the basement level -1 features additional luggage belts.<ref>{{cite

Initially named ''Microtia'', this had to be corrected, because the genus name ''[[Microtia (butterfly)|Microtia]]'' was already used for [[butterflies]].\n\nThe surface features of the ancient [[karst]] developed in [[Mesozoic]] [[limestone]]. In these, [[sediment]] accumulated together with the remains of the local fauna, forming thick layers of reddish, massive or crudely stratified [[silt]]y-[[sand]]y [[clay]]s, known as ''terrae rossae'' (\"red [[soil]]s\"). Through the mid-[[Pliocene]], some of these deposits were flooded, probably due to [[tectonic]] movement of the [[Apulian Plate]]. Others were overlaid by other sediments of [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] or [[freshwater]] origin. In this way a buried, partially reworked paleokarst originated.\n\nLater, as the [[ice ages]] cycle got underway, sea levels sank and the former island was continentalized. In the cool and [[semiarid]] conditions of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (some 1.8\u20130.8 mya) a second karstic cycle occurred, producing the neokarst which removed part of the paleokarst fill.\n\n===Fauna===\nThe Gargano Island endemic [[mammal]]s included:\n* ''[[Deinogalerix]]'' - 5 species of [[gymnure]]s (\"hairy hedgehogs\"), among them the giant ''D. koenigswaldi'' with a skull of c.20&nbsp;cm length. (Freudenthal, 1972; Butler, 1980)\n* ''[[Hoplitomeryx]]'' - some 5 species of \"prongdeer\" with five horns and sabre-like upper [[canine teeth]]. They ranged from tiny to the size of a [[red deer]], and large and small ones apparently occurred at the same time rather than one evolving from the other. (Leinders 1984, van der Geer 2005, van der Geer 2008)\n* ''Mikrotia'' - 3 or more species of [[murinae|murine]] rodent. The largest species, ''M. magna'', had a skull 10&nbsp;cm long. (Freudenthal, 1976, Parra ''et al.'', 1999)\n* ''Paralutra garganensis'' - an endemic species of [[otter]]. (Willemsen, 1983)\n* ''[[Prolagus]] imperialis'' and ''P. apricenicus'' - huge endemic [[pika]] species- ''P. imperialis'' was larger than any other known ''Prolagus''.(Mazza, 1987)\n* ''Stertomys'' - 5 species of [[dormouse]], among them the giant ''S. laticrestatus'' (Daams and Freudenthal, 1985) and four smaller species (Freudenthal and Mart\u00edn-Su\u00e1rez, 2006)\n* ''Hattomys'' - 3 species of giant hamsters, among them the giant ''H. gargantua''. (Freudenthal, 1985)\n\nNon-endemic mammals found on the island included:\n* ''[[Apodemus]] gorafensis'' - a field mouse\n* A prehistoric species of ''[[Cricetus]]'' [[hamster]] (Freudenthal, 1985)\n* ''Megacricetodon'' - another hamster (Freudenthal, 1985)\n\nBird species occurring at Gargano included (studied by Ballmann, 1973, 1976)<!-- (Ballmann, 1973, 1976) -->:\n* ''[[Apus (genus)|Apus]] wetmorei'', a [[swift (bird)|swift]].\n* ''[[Columba (genus)|Columba]] omnisanctorum'' - one of the oldest [[pigeon]] fossils known.

Wilhelm was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1985 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1985]], and is one of 83 pitchers enshrined in the Hall.\n\nWilhelm grew up in North Carolina, fought in World War II, and then spent several years in the minor leagues before starting his major league career at the age of 29. He was best known for his [[knuckleball]], which enabled him to have great longevity. He appeared occasionally as a starting pitcher, but pitched mainly as a [[relief pitcher|reliever]]. Wilhelm won 124 games in relief, which is still the major league record. He was the first pitcher to reach 200 [[save (baseball)|saves]], and the first to appear in 1,000 games.\n\nWilhelm was nearly 30 years old when he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he was nearly 50. He retired with one of the lowest career [[earned run average]]s, 2.52, in baseball history.

He batted and threw left-handed.<ref name=Data>Pitching Splits, Batter Matchups, Daily pitching logs at [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/H/Pharsj101.htm Retrosheet] and daily [https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/harshja01.shtml pitching gamelogs] at Baseball-Reference.com.</ref>\n\n==From slugger to pitcher==\nHarshman was born in [[San Diego, California]], in 1927. He began his professional career at the age of 17 in 1945 for the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[minor league baseball|minor league]] AA [[Pacific Coast League]]. For his first five seasons, Harshman was being conditioned to be a major league hitter instead of a pitcher. Harshman's short stint in San Diego ended with a .254 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] in 67 [[at-bats]].<ref name=Data/>\n\nIn 1946, Harshman moved over to the Class C [[Modesto Reds]], where he hit .288 in 56 games before being shipped back to the PCL San Diego squad for only 3 games. 1947 was his first busy season as he played in 151 games for the [[Victoria Athletics]] in the [[Western International League]]. Harshman smashed 36 [[home run]]s while batting a modest .306. He then moved up yet again to the San Diego squad for just 11 games and a poor .148 average.<ref name=Data/> Despite the sluggish ending, the major league [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] purchased his contract as a first baseman in December 1947.<ref>{{cite news |title=Giants Acquire San Diego Star |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |page=9 |date=4 December 1947 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Harshman went to the [[Jersey City Giants]] of the AAA [[International League]]. He hit 24 home runs, drove in 76 runs, and batted .245. He received a brief call-up to the Giants and batted .250 in 9 plate appearances.<ref name=Data/>\n\n1949 was a breakout year for the 21-year-old slugger. In 150 games for the AA [[Minneapolis Millers]], Harshman smashed 40 home runs and had 111 RBI. 1950 saw an unexpected change in Jack's progression. He batted a terrible .193 in 35 games for the Class A [[Jacksonville Suns|Jacksonville Tars]] and a below average .230 for Minneapolis. His second MLB stint with the Giants went even worse, batting just .125 in 32 at bats.<ref name=Data/>\n\nIt was around this point that management thought about changing Harshman's role in the organization. During his sluggish 1950 season, he was brought in to pitch two games for the Jacksonville Tars. He threw for 12 innings and a 6.75 ERA, splitting his 2 games for a 1\u20131 record.<ref name=Data/>\n\nIn 1951 Harshman got back on track with his slugging career. In 154 games for the [[Nashville Volunteers]], he crashed 47 home runs with a fair .251 average. However, his manager once again experimented with Jack potentially being a pitcher, letting him take the field in 5 games. He posted another 1\u20131 record, but lowered his ERA to 3.94.<ref name=Data/>\n\nDespite bringing a huge bat in the previous season, the decision was made to give Harshman double duty as a pitcher and occasional utility hitter. He batted .222 with 8 home runs and 15 RBI in just 135 at bats, but most of his work for the 1952 season came from on the mound. Harshman pitched in 26 games with 14 starts, threw a total of 131 innings with 78 strikeouts, a 4.67 ERA, and an average 6\u20137 win-loss record.<ref name=Data/>\n\n1953 was Harshman's breakout year. In the AA [[Southern Association]] Nashville Volunteers, Jack posted a remarkable 23\u20137 record with a 3.27 ERA.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Chicago White Sox==\nDespite his successful transition from a first baseman slugger to a young phenom pitcher, the New York baseball Giants allowed the [[Chicago White Sox]] to purchase Harshman's contract. Jack made his White Sox debut against the [[Cleveland Indians]] on April 14, 1954. He started the game, but only lasted 3{{fraction|2|3}} innings after being tagged for 4 earned runs on 8 hits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chisox Whip Hoeft; Dorish Stars in Relief |work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]] |page=D1 |date=15 April 1954 }}</ref> After another poor 2{{fraction|1|3}} innings start on April 19,<ref>{{cite news |last=Burns |first=Edward |title=Sox Fall, 6 to 3; Lemon Yields 3 Hits |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |page=4-2 |date=20 April 1954 }}</ref> Harshman was demoted to the bullpen.

Jack posted a 6\u20130 record with 47 strikeouts and a microscopic 0.77 ERA. His first full season posted some impressive numbers: A 14\u20138 win-loss record, a 2.95 ERA, 4 complete game shut-outs, and 134 strikeouts, which was good enough for 5th in the American League.<ref name=Data/>\n\nHarshman found moderate success in the 1955 season by putting up an 11\u20137 record and a 3.36 ERA while finishing 9th in the AL in strikeouts with 116.<ref name=Data/> On June 21, 1956, at Comiskey Park, Jack achieved a rarity in Major League Baseball that had only happened twice before in the modern era. Both he and the opposing [[Baltimore Orioles]] starting pitcher [[Connie Johnson (baseball)|Connie Johnson]] threw a one-hit complete game.

Following an 8\u20138 season with the 1957 White Sox,<ref name=Data/> Harshman, [[Larry Doby]] and [[Jim Marshall (baseball)|Jim Marshall]] were traded to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Billy Goodman]], [[Tito Francona]] and [[Ray Moore (baseball)|Ray Moore]] at the [[Winter meetings]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WEgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CCYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6443,3626156&dq|title=Chisox Get Francona, Moore & Goodman|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal]]|date=December 4, 1957}}</ref> When it was discovered by the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc, Baseball Commissioner [[Ford Frick]] ordered the Chisox to send either $20,000 or an acceptable player to the Orioles.

His ERA was a career-low 2.89, 3rd best in the AL, and he compiled a career-high 161 strikeouts to go with 3 shutouts. However, run support was scarce and he ended the season with a 12\u201315 record.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians==\nHarshman became a journeyman in 1959, playing for three different teams throughout the season. Jack got off to an awful start for the Orioles with an 0\u20136 record and a 6.85 ERA before being traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Billy Hoeft]] on June 15, 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Red Sox Get Harshman; Hoeft Goes to Orioles in Trade of Southpaws |work=[[New York Times]] |page=42 |date=16 June 1959 }}</ref> Harshman would only spend one month with the Red Sox, going 2\u20133 with a 6.57 ERA in 2 starts and 6 games of relief.<ref name=Data/>\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] bought Harshman's contract on July 30, 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indians Purchase Jack Harshman |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |page=14 |date=30 July 1959 }}</ref> At this point, he finally settled down and posted up a 5\u20131 record to go with a 2.59 ERA in 66 innings of work.<ref name=Data/>\n\n1960 would prove to be the final season for Harshman in the majors. At the age of 32, his back problems were catching up with him. He was forced onto the disabled list on April 24 after checking into the Cleveland Lakeside Hospital to treat problems connected to slipped discs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hurler Jack Harshman Put On Disabled List |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |page=34 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=24 April 1960 }}</ref> It would take three months before he would take the mound again. Right from the start, he could not regain his groove. On July 24, the Red Sox teed him off on 5 runs on 3 hits and 4 walks before being pulled after just 3 innings. He would never get back on track, ending his final season with a 2\u20134 record and a 3.98 ERA.<ref name=Data/>\n\nIn October, Harshman was released by the Indians.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indians Drop Harshman |work=[[New York Times]] |page=58 |date=19 October 1960 }}</ref> In 1961, Jack participated in [[spring training]] in an effort to make the [[Los Angeles Angels]] roster, but instead ended up with a familiar team from his first professional year, the AAA Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. He would go on to pitch in only 4 games, compiling a 0\u20131 record and a 6.00 ERA.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Death==\nOn August 17, 2013, Harshman died in [[Georgetown, Texas]] where he lived.

Jack made his White Sox debut against the [[Cleveland Indians]] on April 14, 1954. He started the game, but only lasted 3{{fraction|2|3}} innings after being tagged for 4 earned runs on 8 hits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chisox Whip Hoeft; Dorish Stars in Relief |work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]] |page=D1 |date=15 April 1954 }}</ref> After another poor 2{{fraction|1|3}} innings start on April 19,<ref>{{cite news |last=Burns |first=Edward |title=Sox Fall, 6 to 3; Lemon Yields 3 Hits |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |page=4-2 |date=20 April 1954 }}</ref> Harshman was demoted to the bullpen. He continued to struggle until he was given another start on June 6. He responded by throwing a 7-hit shutout against the [[Washington Senators (1901\u20131960)|Washington Senators]].<ref>{{cite news |title=White Sox Extend Streak to Five By Beating Senators, 5-3 and 6-0; Minoso's 2-Run Homer Wins Opener -- Harshman Triumphs on Mound in Second Game |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[New York Times]] |page=26 |date=7 June 1954 }}</ref> On July 25, he struck out 16 Red Sox hitters, including the great [[Ted Williams]] in a complete game for a 5\u20132 win.<ref>{{cite news |last=Prell |first=Edward |title=16 Harshman Whiffs Spur Sox |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=B1 |date=26 July 1954 }}</ref> At the time it was the most strikeouts in the long history of [[Fenway Park]]. The record would stand for 32 years until a young flamethrower named [[Roger Clemens]] fanned a Major League best 20 batters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Clemens fans a record 20 |last=Shaughnessy |first=Dan |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=30 April 1986 }}</ref> After that, Jack settled down and had a largely successful season overall, including an exceptional performance for the month of August. Jack posted a 6\u20130 record with 47 strikeouts and a microscopic 0.77 ERA. His first full season posted some impressive numbers: A 14\u20138 win-loss record, a 2.95 ERA, 4 complete game shut-outs, and 134 strikeouts, which was good enough for 5th in the American League.<ref name=Data/>\n\nHarshman found moderate success in the 1955 season by putting up an 11\u20137 record and a 3.36 ERA while finishing 9th in the AL in strikeouts with 116.<ref name=Data/> On June 21, 1956, at Comiskey Park, Jack achieved a rarity in Major League Baseball that had only happened twice before in the modern era. Both he and the opposing [[Baltimore Orioles]] starting pitcher [[Connie Johnson (baseball)|Connie Johnson]] threw a one-hit complete game. Harshman picked up the win 1 to 0.<ref name=\"onehit\">{{cite news |title=White Sox Shade Orioles in Duel of One-Hitters, 1-0 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |page=10 |date=27 June 1956 }}</ref> Jack would go on to throw three more shutouts in the season, compiling a 15\u201312 record with a 3.10 ERA and 143 strikeouts, good enough for 8th in the league.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Baltimore Orioles==\n1956 turned out to be the last solid season for Harshman, as the rest of his career was downhill from thereon out. Following an 8\u20138 season with the 1957 White Sox,<ref name=Data/> Harshman, [[Larry Doby]] and [[Jim Marshall (baseball)|Jim Marshall]] were traded to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Billy Goodman]], [[Tito Francona]] and [[Ray Moore (baseball)|Ray Moore]] at the [[Winter meetings]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WEgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CCYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6443,3626156&dq|title=Chisox Get Francona, Moore & Goodman|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal]]|date=December 4, 1957}}</ref> When it was discovered by the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc, Baseball Commissioner [[Ford Frick]] ordered the Chisox to send either $20,000 or an acceptable player to the Orioles.

His ERA was a career-low 2.89, 3rd best in the AL, and he compiled a career-high 161 strikeouts to go with 3 shutouts. However, run support was scarce and he ended the season with a 12\u201315 record.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians==\nHarshman became a journeyman in 1959, playing for three different teams throughout the season. Jack got off to an awful start for the Orioles with an 0\u20136 record and a 6.85 ERA before being traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Billy Hoeft]] on June 15, 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Red Sox Get Harshman; Hoeft Goes to Orioles in Trade of Southpaws |work=[[New York Times]] |page=42 |date=16 June 1959 }}</ref> Harshman would only spend one month with the Red Sox, going 2\u20133 with a 6.57 ERA in 2 starts and 6 games of relief.<ref name=Data/>\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] bought Harshman's contract on July 30, 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indians Purchase Jack Harshman |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |page=14 |date=30 July 1959 }}</ref> At this point, he finally settled down and posted up a 5\u20131 record to go with a 2.59 ERA in 66 innings of work.<ref name=Data/>\n\n1960 would prove to be the final season for Harshman in the majors. At the age of 32, his back problems were catching up with him. He was forced onto the disabled list on April 24 after checking into the Cleveland Lakeside Hospital to treat problems connected to slipped discs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hurler Jack Harshman Put On Disabled List |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |page=34 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=24 April 1960 }}</ref> It would take three months before he would take the mound again. Right from the start, he could not regain his groove. On July 24, the Red Sox teed him off on 5 runs on 3 hits and 4 walks before being pulled after just 3 innings. He would never get back on track, ending his final season with a 2\u20134 record and a 3.98 ERA.<ref name=Data/>\n\nIn October, Harshman was released by the Indians.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indians Drop Harshman |work=[[New York Times]] |page=58 |date=19 October 1960 }}</ref> In 1961, Jack participated in [[spring training]] in an effort to make the [[Los Angeles Angels]] roster, but instead ended up with a familiar team from his first professional year, the AAA Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. He would go on to pitch in only 4 games, compiling a 0\u20131 record and a 6.00 ERA.<ref name=Data/>\n\n==Death==\nOn August 17, 2013, Harshman died in [[Georgetown, Texas]] where he lived.
