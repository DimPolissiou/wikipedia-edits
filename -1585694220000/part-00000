[[Correlations]] of, for example, customer-focus with business success then become meaningless, because success was the basis for the measure of customer focus.\n# ''The Delusion of Correlation and Causality:'' mistakenly thinking that [[Correlation is not causation|correlation is causation]].\n# ''The Delusion of Single Explanations:'' arguments that factor X improves performance by 40% and factor Y improves by another 40%, so both at once will result in an 80% improvement. The fallacy is that X and Y might be very strongly correlated. E.g. X might improve performance by causing Y.\n# ''The Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots:'' looking only at successful companies and finding their common features, without comparing them against unsuccessful companies.\n# ''The Delusion of Rigorous Research:'' Some authors boast of the amount of data that they have collected, as though that in itself made the conclusions of the research valid.\n# ''The Delusion of Lasting Success:'' the \"secrets of success\" books imply that lasting success is achievable, if only managers will follow their recommended approach. Rosenzweig argues that truly lasting success (outperforming the market for more than a generation) never happens in business.\n# ''The Delusion of Absolute Performance:'' market performance is down to what competitors do as well as what the company itself does. A company can do everything right and yet still fall behind.\n# ''The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick:'' getting cause the wrong way round. E.g. successful companies have a Corporate Social Responsibility policy.

This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]]. Although the ''[[tafsir]]'' literature does not interpret this as a homoerotic allusion, the connection was made in other literary genres, mostly humorously.<ref name=EoQ/> For example, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era poet [[Abu Nuwas]] wrote:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia|title=Islam|author=Elyse Semerdjian|page=132|editor=Jeffrey S.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.

It is not restricted to homosexual behaviour, however, and deals more generally with ''[[zina]]'' ([[Islamic sexual jurisprudence#Illegal sex (fornication)|illicit sexual intercourse]]):<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&pg=PA88|last=Wafer |first=Jim |chapter=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality |editor=Stephen O.

This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times.<ref name=EoQ/>\n\n===== Cupbearers in paradise =====\n\nSome Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to \"immortal boys\" (56:17, 76:19) or \"young men\" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]]. Although the ''[[tafsir]]'' literature does not interpret this as a homoerotic allusion, the connection was made in other literary genres, mostly humorously.<ref name=EoQ/> For example, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era poet [[Abu Nuwas]] wrote:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia|title=Islam|author=Elyse Semerdjian|page=132|editor=Jeffrey S.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and ''[[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|karagoz]]'', the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular. Dream interpretation literature declined, the puppet theater was purged of its coarser elements, and homoeroticism began to be regarded as abnormal and shameful.}}</ref> In [[Iran]], several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]] on accusations of homosexuality, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's ''Islamic Penal Code'', enacted in 1991.

He, along with other queer Muslims who left the old Al-Fitrah Foundation founded a new organization in 2018 called Al-Ghurbaah Foundation. Imam Muhsin Hendricks also administers the Compassion-centred Islamic Network (CCI Network) which is a global network that seeks to connect and create a stronger voice for queer Muslims amongst activists, academics, Islamic scholars and religious leaders (Imams).  Currently, the organization's main focus is working with religious leaders (Imams) while serving the needs of the queer Muslim community globally.
