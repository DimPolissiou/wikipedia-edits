No combined sports were included in the 2012 Championships. Not all events were open to all classifications, with several throwing and jumping events being contested between classifications, which were then decided on a points system. The men's 100m relay was the only event to use mixed classifications as a team, with each leg of the relay contested by a different classification athlete. There were no women's relay events. In total there were 144 events held over 17 disciplines.\n\nAthletes finishing in first place are awarded the gold medal, second place the silver medal and third place the bronze. If only three competitors are available to challenge for an event then no bronze medal is awarded.

No combined sports were included in the 2012 Championships. Not all events were open to all classifications, with several throwing and jumping events being contested between classifications, which were then decided on a points system. The men's 100m relay was the only event to use mixed classifications as a team, with each leg of the relay contested by a different classification athlete. There were no women's relay events. In total there were 144 events held over 17 disciplines.\n\nAthletes finishing in first place are awarded the gold medal, second place the silver medal and third place the bronze. If only three competitors are available to challenge for an event then no bronze medal is awarded. Some events were classed as 'no medal' events.\n\n==Coverage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Events==\n\n===Opening ceremony===\n\n===Classification===\n{{main|Disability sport classification}}\nTo ensure competition is as fair and balanced as possible, athletes are [[Disability sport classification|classified]] dependent on how their disability impacts on their chosen event/s. Thus athletes may compete in an event against competitors with a different disability to themselves. Where there are more than one classification in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a points system is used to determine the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Athletics/Rulesandregulations/Classification|title=Classification |date=|accessdate=22 July 2013|publisher=paralympic.org}}</ref>\n\n*F = field athletes\n*T = track athletes\n*11-13 \u2013 visually impaired, 11 and 12 compete with a [[sighted guide]]\n*20 \u2013 intellectual disability\n*31-38 \u2013 [[cerebral palsy]] or other conditions that affect muscle co-ordination and control.
