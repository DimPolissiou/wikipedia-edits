{"title_page": "Planck units", "text_new": "{{pp-dispute|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\nIn [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology]], '''Planck units''' are a set of [[units of measurement]] defined exclusively in terms of five universal [[physical constants]], in such a manner that these five physical constants take on the numerical value of [[1 (number)|1]] when expressed in terms of these units.\n\nOriginally proposed in 1899 by German physicist [[Max Planck]], these units are also known as [[natural units]] because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[Nature#Matter and energy|nature]] and not from any [[Prototype (metrology)|human construct]]. Planck units are only one system of several systems of [[natural units]], but Planck units are not based on properties of any [[Prototype (metrology)|prototype object]] or [[elementary particle|particle]] (that would be arbitrarily chosen), but rather on only the properties of [[free space]]. Planck units have significance for theoretical physics since they simplify several recurring [[algebraic expression]]s of [[physical law]] by [[nondimensionalization]]. They are relevant in research on unified theories such as [[quantum gravity]].\n\nThe term '''Planck scale''' refers to the magnitudes of space, time, energy and other units, below which (or beyond which) the predictions of the [[Standard Model]], [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]] are no longer reconcilable, and  [[Quantum Gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] are expected to dominate. This region may be characterized by [[energy|energies]] around {{val|1.22|e=19|u=GeV}} (the [[Planck energy]]), [[time]] intervals around {{val|5.39|e=\u221244|u=s}} (the [[Planck time]]) and [[length]]s around {{val|1.62|e=-35|u=m}} (the [[Planck length]]). At the Planck scale, current models are not expected to be a useful guide to the cosmos, and [[physicist]]s have no [[scientific model]] to suggest how the physical universe behaves. The best known example is represented by the conditions in the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds [[Chronology of the universe|of our universe]] after the [[Big Bang]], approximately 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThe five universal constants that Planck units, by definition, normalize to 1 are:\n* the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, ''c'',\n* the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'',\n* the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'',\n* the [[Coulomb constant]], ''k''<sub>e</sub> = {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}}\n* the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''k''<sub>B</sub>\n\nEach of these constants can be associated with a fundamental physical theory or concept: ''c'' with [[special relativity]], ''G'' with [[general relativity]], ''\u0127'' with [[quantum mechanics]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> with [[electromagnetism]], and ''k''<sub>B</sub> with the notion of [[temperature]]/[[energy]] ([[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]]).\n\n== Introduction ==\nAny system of measurement may be assigned a mutually independent set of base quantities and associated [[Base unit (measurement)|base units]], from which all other quantities and units may be derived.  In the [[International System of Units]], for example, the [[SI base quantity|SI base quantities]] include length with the associated unit of the [[metre]]. In the system of Planck units, a similar set of base quantities may be selected, and the Planck base unit of length is then known simply as the [[Planck length]], the base unit of time is the [[Planck time]], and so on. These units are derived from the five dimensional universal physical constants of Table 1, in such a manner that these constants are eliminated from fundamental selected equations of physical law when physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units. For example, Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]],\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n F &= G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\\\\n   &= \\left( \\frac{F_\\text{P} l_\\text{P}^2}{m_\\text{P}^2} \\right) \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\n\ncan be expressed as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{F}{F_\\text{P}} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{m_1}{m_\\text{P}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{m_2}{m_\\text{P}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{r}{l_\\text{P}}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nBoth equations are [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally consistent]] and equally valid in ''any'' system of units, but the second equation, with ''G'' missing, is relating only [[dimensionless quantities]] since any ratio of two like-dimensioned quantities is a dimensionless quantity. If, by a shorthand convention, it is understood that all physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units, the ratios above may be expressed simply with the symbols of physical quantity, without being scaled explicitly by their corresponding unit:\n\n: <math> F = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis last equation (without ''G'')  is valid only if ''F'', ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>, and ''r'' are the dimensionless numerical values of these quantities measured in terms of Planck units. This is why Planck units or any other use of natural units should be employed with care. Referring to {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, [[Paul S. Wesson]] wrote that, \"Mathematically it is an acceptable trick which saves labour.

Yet relative to other units of measurement such as [[International System of Units|SI]], the values of the Planck units are only known approximately. This is due to uncertainty in the values of the gravitational constant ''G'' and ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> in SI units.\n\nThe values of ''c'', ''h'', ''e'' and ''k''<sub>B</sub> in SI units are exact due to the definition of the second, metre, kilogram and kelvin in terms of these constants, and contribute no uncertainty to the values of the Planck units expressed in terms of SI units. The vacuum permittivity ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> has a relative uncertainty of {{physconst|eps0|runc=yes|after=.}} The numerical value of ''G'' has been determined experimentally to a relative uncertainty of {{physconst|G|runc=yes|after=.}} ''G'' appears in the definition of every Planck unit other than for charge in Tables 2 and 3. Hence the uncertainty in the values of the Table 2 and 3 SI equivalents of the Planck units derives almost entirely from uncertainty in the value of ''G''. (The propagation of the error in ''G'' is a function of the exponent of ''G'' in the algebraic expression for a unit. Since that exponent is \u00b1{{sfrac|1|2}} for every base unit other than Planck charge, the relative uncertainty of each base unit is about one half that of ''G''.)\n\n== Derived units ==\nIn any system of measurement, units for many physical quantities can be derived from base units. Table 3 offers a sample of derived Planck units, some of which in fact are seldom used.

In fact, 1 Planck unit is often the largest or smallest value of a physical quantity that makes sense within present-day theories of physics. For example, our understanding of the [[Big Bang]] begins with the [[Chronology of the universe#Planck epoch|Planck epoch]], when the universe was 1 Planck time old and 1 Planck length in diameter. Understanding the universe when it was less than 1 Planck time old requires a theory of [[quantum gravity]] that would incorporate quantum effects into [[general relativity]]. Such a theory does not yet exist.\n\nAn exception to the general pattern of Planck units being \"extreme\" in magnitude is the [[Planck mass]], which is about [[1 E-8 kg|22 micrograms]]: very large compared to subatomic particles, but well within the mass range of living things.\n\n== Significance ==\nPlanck units have little [[anthropocentric]] arbitrariness, but do still involve some arbitrary choices in terms of the defining constants. Unlike the [[metre]] and [[second]], which exist as [[SI base unit|base units]] in the [[SI]] system for historical reasons, the [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] are conceptually linked at a fundamental physical level. Consequently, natural units help physicists to reframe questions. [[Frank Wilczek]] puts it succinctly:\n{{bq|We see that the question [posed] is not, \"Why is gravity so feeble?\" but rather, \"Why is the proton's mass so small?\" For in natural (Planck) units, the strength of gravity simply is what it is, a primary quantity, while the proton's mass is the tiny number [1/(13&nbsp;[[Names of large numbers|quintillion]])].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scaling Mount Planck I: A View from the Bottom|journal=Physics Today|volume=54|issue=6|pages=12\u201313|year=2001|last=Wilczek|first=Frank|doi=10.1063/1.1387576|bibcode=2001PhT....54f..12W}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile it is true that the electrostatic repulsive force between two protons (alone in free space) greatly exceeds the gravitational attractive force between the same two protons, this is not about the relative strengths of the two fundamental forces. From the point of view of Planck units, this is [[comparing apples to oranges]], because [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] are [[Dimensional analysis|incommensurable]] quantities. Rather, the disparity of magnitude of force is a manifestation of the fact that the [[elementary charge|charge on the protons]] is approximately the [[Planck charge|unit charge]] but the [[Proton mass|mass of the protons]] is far less than the [[Planck mass|unit mass]].\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Chronology of the Universe}}\n{{anchor|Planck epoch}}\nIn [[Big Bang cosmology]], the '''Planck epoch''' or '''Planck era''' is the earliest stage of the [[Big Bang]], before the [[cosmic time|time passed]] was equal to the [[Planck time]], ''t''<sub>P</sub>, or approximately 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |work=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }} - discusses \"[[Planck time]]\" and \"[[Planck era]]\" at the very beginning of the [[Universe]]</ref> There is no currently available physical theory to describe such short times, and it is not clear in what sense the concept of [[time]] is meaningful for values smaller than the Planck time.

At this scale, the [[grand unification|unified force]] of the [[Standard Model]] is assumed to be [[Theory of everything|unified with gravitation]]. Immeasurably [[Planck temperature|hot]] and [[Planck density|dense]], the state of the Planck epoch was succeeded by the [[grand unification epoch]], where gravitation is separated from the unified force of the Standard Model, in turn followed by the [[inflationary epoch]], which ended after about 10<sup>\u221232</sup> seconds (or about 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;''t''<sub>P</sub>).<ref name=\"KolbTurner1994\">{{cite book|author1=Edward W.

However, at that time it was entering Wien's radiation law which Planck thought to be correct. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:\n{{bq|''...ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr alle Zeiten und f\u00fcr alle, auch au\u00dferirdische und au\u00dfermenschliche Kulturen notwendig behalten und welche daher als \u00bbnat\u00fcrliche Ma\u00dfeinheiten\u00ab bezeichnet werden k\u00f6nnen...''\n...These necessarily retain their meaning for all times and for all civilizations, even extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and can therefore be designated as \"natural units\"...}}\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units.

These normalizations are neither the only ones possible nor necessarily the best. Moreover, the choice of what factors to normalize, among the factors appearing in the fundamental equations of physics, is not evident, and the values of the Planck units are sensitive to this choice.\n\nThe factor 4{{pi}} is ubiquitous in [[theoretical physics]] because the surface area of a [[sphere]] of radius ''r'' is 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>. This, along with the concept of [[flux]], are the basis for the [[inverse-square law]], [[Gauss's law]], and the [[divergence]] operator applied to [[flux density]]. For example, [[Gravitational field|gravitational]] and [[electrostatic field]]s produced by point charges have spherical symmetry (Barrow 2002: 214\u201315). The 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> appearing in the denominator of Coulomb's law in [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units#Maxwell's equations with sources|rationalized form]], for example, follows from the flux of an electrostatic field being distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere. Likewise for Newton's law of universal gravitation. (If space had more than three spatial dimensions, the factor 4{{pi}} would have to be changed according to the geometry of the [[S\u00b2|sphere in higher dimensions]].)\n\nHence a substantial body of physical theory developed since Planck (1899) suggests normalizing not ''G'' but either 4{{pi}}''G'' (or 8{{pi}}''G'' or 16{{pi}}''G'') to 1. Doing so would introduce a factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} (or {{sfrac|8{{pi}}}} or {{sfrac|16{{pi}}}}) into the nondimensionalized form of the law of universal gravitation, consistent with the modern rationalized formulation of Coulomb's law in terms of the vacuum permittivity. In fact, alternative normalizations frequently preserve the factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} in the nondimensionalized form of Coulomb's law as well, so that the nondimensionalized Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism and [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] both take the same form as those for electromagnetism in SI, which do not have any factors of 4{{pi}}.  When this is applied to electromagnetic constants, ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>, this unit system is called ''\"rationalized\"'' [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]].  When applied additionally to gravitation and Planck units, these are called '''rationalized Planck units'''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kaluza-Klein Monopole|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=51|issue=2|pages=87\u201390|year=1983|last=Sorkin|first=Rafael|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.87|bibcode=1983PhRvL..51...87S}}</ref> and are seen in [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wUFoP7HC38C&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=elementary+charge+0.3028 high-energy physics].\n\nThe rationalized Planck units are defined so that <math>c=4\\pi G=\\hbar=\\varepsilon_0=k_\\text{B}=1</math>.\n\nThere are several possible alternative normalizations.\n\n=== Gravity ===\n<!-- [[Reduced Planck units]], [[Planck mass]] and [[Cosmological constant]] link to this section -->\nIn 1899, Newton's law of universal gravitation was still seen as exact, rather than as a convenient approximation holding for \"small\" velocities and masses (the approximate nature of Newton's law was shown following the development of [[general relativity]] in 1915). Hence Planck normalized to 1 the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' in Newton's law. In theories emerging after 1899, ''G'' nearly always appears in formulae multiplied by 4{{pi}} or a small integer multiple thereof. Hence, a choice to be made when designing a system of natural units is which, if any, instances of 4{{pi}} appearing in the equations of physics are to be eliminated via the normalization.\n* Normalizing 4{{pi}}''G'' to 1:\n:* [[Gauss's law for gravity]] becomes {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u2212''M''}} (rather than {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u22124{{pi}}''M''}} in Planck units).\n:* Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Poisson equation]].\n:* Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' in the [[Gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitoelectromagnetic]] (GEM) equations, which hold in weak [[gravitational field]]s or [[Locally flat spacetime|locally flat space-time]].

Such cosmologies have not gained mainstream acceptance and yet there is still considerable scientific interest in the possibility that physical \"constants\" might change, although such propositions introduce difficult questions. Perhaps the first question to address is: How would such a change make a noticeable operational difference in physical measurement or, more fundamentally, our perception of reality? If some particular physical constant had changed, how would we notice it, or how would physical reality be different? Which changed constants result in a meaningful and measurable difference in physical reality? If a [[physical constant]] that is not [[dimensionless]], such as the [[speed of light]], ''did'' in fact change, would we be able to notice it or measure it unambiguously? \u2013 a question examined by [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]] in his paper \"Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants\".<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\">{{cite arXiv|author=Michael Duff |title=Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants|eprint=hep-th/0208093|year=2002|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)}}</ref><ref name=\"hep-th1412.2040\">{{cite book|author=Michael Duff |title=How fundamental are fundamental constants?|arxiv=1412.2040|year=2014|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)|doi=10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n[[George Gamow]] argued in his book ''[[Mr Tompkins in Wonderland]]'' that a sufficient change in a dimensionful physical constant, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, would result in obvious perceptible changes. But this idea is challenged:\n\n{{quotation|[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like ''\u03b1'' define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by ''\u03b1'' is a combination of the electron charge, ''e'', the speed of light, ''c'', and Planck's constant, ''h''. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If ''c'', ''h'', and ''e'' were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of ''\u03b1'' remained the same, this new world would be ''observationally indistinguishable'' from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature.

When one commonly measures a length with a ruler or tape-measure, that person is actually counting tick marks on a given standard or is measuring the length relative to that given standard, which is a dimensionless value. It is no different for physical experiments, as all physical quantities are measured relative to some other like-dimensioned quantity.\n\nWe can notice a difference if some dimensionless physical quantity such as [[fine-structure constant]], ''\u03b1'', changes or the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]], {{sfrac|''m''<sub>p</sub>|''m''<sub>e</sub>}}, changes (atomic structures would change) but if all dimensionless physical quantities remained unchanged (this includes all possible ratios of identically dimensioned physical quantity), we cannot tell if a dimensionful quantity, such as the [[speed of light]], ''c'', has changed. And, indeed, the Tompkins concept becomes meaningless in our perception of reality if a dimensional quantity such as ''c'' [[Variable speed of light|has changed]], even drastically.\n\nIf the speed of light ''c'', were somehow suddenly cut in half and changed to {{sfrac|2}}''c'' (but with the axiom that ''all'' dimensionless physical quantities remain the same), then the Planck length would ''increase'' by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}} from the point of view of some unaffected observer on the outside. Measured by \"mortal\" observers in terms of Planck units, the new speed of light would remain as 1 new Planck length per 1 new Planck time \u2013 which is no different from the old measurement. But, since by axiom, the size of atoms (approximately the [[Bohr radius]]) are related to the Planck length by an unchanging dimensionless constant of proportionality:\n\n: <math>a_0 = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = \\frac{m_\\text{P}}{m_e \\alpha} l_\\text{P}. </math>\n\nThen atoms would be bigger (in one dimension) by 2{{sqrt|2}}, each of us would be taller by 2{{sqrt|2}}, and so would our metre sticks be taller (and wider and thicker) by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}}. Our perception of distance and lengths relative to the Planck length is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant.\n\nOur clocks would tick slower by a factor of 4{{sqrt|2}} (from the point of view of this unaffected observer on the outside) because the Planck time has increased by 4{{sqrt|2}} but we would not know the difference (our perception of durations of time relative to the Planck time is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant). This hypothetical unaffected observer on the outside might observe that light now propagates at half the speed that it previously did (as well as all other observed velocities) but it would still travel {{val|299792458}} of our ''new'' metres in the time elapsed by one of our ''new'' seconds ({{sfrac|2}}''c'' \u00d7 4{{sqrt|2}} \u00f7 2{{sqrt|2}} continues to equal {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}). We would not notice any difference.\n\nThis contradicts what [[George Gamow]] writes in his book ''[[Mr. Tompkins]]''; there, Gamow suggests that if a dimension-dependent universal constant such as ''c'' changed significantly, we ''would'' easily notice the difference. The disagreement is better thought of as the ambiguity in the phrase ''\"changing a physical constant\"''; what would happen depends on whether (1)&nbsp;all other ''dimensionless'' constants were kept the same, or whether (2)&nbsp;all other dimension-''dependent'' constants are kept the same. The second choice is a somewhat confusing possibility, since most of our units of measurement are defined in relation to the outcomes of physical experiments, and the experimental results depend on the constants. Gamow does not address this subtlety; the thought experiments he conducts in his popular works assume the second choice for ''\"changing a physical constant\"''. And Duff or Barrow would point out that ascribing a change in measurable reality, i.e. [[fine-structure constant|''\u03b1'']], to a specific dimensional component quantity, such as [[speed of light|''c'']], is unjustified. The very same operational difference in measurement or perceived reality could just as well be caused by a change in [[Planck constant|''h'']] or [[elementary charge|''e'']] if ''\u03b1'' is changed and no other dimensionless constants are changed.  It is only the dimensionless physical constants that ultimately matter in the definition of worlds.<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\" /><ref>[[John Baez]] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There?]</ref>\n\nThis unvarying aspect of the Planck-relative scale, or that of any other system of natural units, leads many theorists to conclude that a hypothetical change in dimensionful physical constants can only be manifest as a change in [[dimensionless physical constant]]s.

Planck units are only one system of several systems of [[natural units]], but Planck units are not based on properties of any [[Prototype (metrology)|prototype object]] or [[elementary particle|particle]] (that would be arbitrarily chosen), but rather on only the properties of [[free space]]. Planck units have significance for theoretical physics since they simplify several recurring [[algebraic expression]]s of [[physical law]] by [[nondimensionalization]]. They are relevant in research on unified theories such as [[quantum gravity]].\n\nThe term '''Planck scale''' refers to the magnitudes of space, time, energy and other units, below which (or beyond which) the predictions of the [[Standard Model]], [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]] are no longer reconcilable, and  [[Quantum Gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] are expected to dominate. This region may be characterized by [[energy|energies]] around {{val|1.22|e=19|u=GeV}} (the [[Planck energy]]), [[time]] intervals around {{val|5.39|e=\u221244|u=s}} (the [[Planck time]]) and [[length]]s around {{val|1.62|e=-35|u=m}} (the [[Planck length]]). At the Planck scale, current models are not expected to be a useful guide to the cosmos, and [[physicist]]s have no [[scientific model]] to suggest how the physical universe behaves. The best known example is represented by the conditions in the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds [[Chronology of the universe|of our universe]] after the [[Big Bang]], approximately 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThe five universal constants that Planck units, by definition, normalize to 1 are:\n* the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, ''c'',\n* the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'',\n* the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''\u0127'',\n* the [[Coulomb constant]], ''k''<sub>e</sub> = {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}}\n* the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''k''<sub>B</sub>\n\nEach of these constants can be associated with a fundamental physical theory or concept: ''c'' with [[special relativity]], ''G'' with [[general relativity]], ''\u0127'' with [[quantum mechanics]], ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> with [[electromagnetism]], and ''k''<sub>B</sub> with the notion of [[temperature]]/[[energy]] ([[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]]).\n\n== Introduction ==\nAny system of measurement may be assigned a mutually independent set of base quantities and associated [[Base unit (measurement)|base units]], from which all other quantities and units may be derived.  In the [[International System of Units]], for example, the [[SI base quantity|SI base quantities]] include length with the associated unit of the [[metre]]. In the system of Planck units, a similar set of base quantities may be selected, and the Planck base unit of length is then known simply as the [[Planck length]], the base unit of time is the [[Planck time]], and so on. These units are derived from the five dimensional universal physical constants of Table 1, in such a manner that these constants are eliminated from fundamental selected equations of physical law when physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units. For example, Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]],\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n F &= G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\\\\n   &= \\left( \\frac{F_\\text{P} l_\\text{P}^2}{m_\\text{P}^2} \\right) \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\n\ncan be expressed as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{F}{F_\\text{P}} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{m_1}{m_\\text{P}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{m_2}{m_\\text{P}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{r}{l_\\text{P}}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nBoth equations are [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally consistent]] and equally valid in ''any'' system of units, but the second equation, with ''G'' missing, is relating only [[dimensionless quantities]] since any ratio of two like-dimensioned quantities is a dimensionless quantity. If, by a shorthand convention, it is understood that all physical quantities are expressed in terms of Planck units, the ratios above may be expressed simply with the symbols of physical quantity, without being scaled explicitly by their corresponding unit:\n\n: <math> F = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis last equation (without ''G'')  is valid only if ''F'', ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>, and ''r'' are the dimensionless numerical values of these quantities measured in terms of Planck units. This is why Planck units or any other use of natural units should be employed with care. Referring to {{nowrap|''G'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, [[Paul S.

Yet relative to other units of measurement such as [[International System of Units|SI]], the values of the Planck units are only known approximately. This is due to uncertainty in the values of the gravitational constant ''G'' and ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> in SI units.\n\nThe values of ''c'', ''h'', ''e'' and ''k''<sub>B</sub> in SI units are exact due to the definition of the second, metre, kilogram and kelvin in terms of these constants, and contribute no uncertainty to the values of the Planck units expressed in terms of SI units. The vacuum permittivity ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> has a relative uncertainty of {{physconst|eps0|runc=yes|after=.}} The numerical value of ''G'' has been determined experimentally to a relative uncertainty of {{physconst|G|runc=yes|after=.}} ''G'' appears in the definition of every Planck unit other than for charge in Tables 2 and 3. Hence the uncertainty in the values of the Table 2 and 3 SI equivalents of the Planck units derives almost entirely from uncertainty in the value of ''G''. (The propagation of the error in ''G'' is a function of the exponent of ''G'' in the algebraic expression for a unit. Since that exponent is \u00b1{{sfrac|1|2}} for every base unit other than Planck charge, the relative uncertainty of each base unit is about one half that of ''G''.)\n\n== Derived units ==\nIn any system of measurement, units for many physical quantities can be derived from base units. Table 3 offers a sample of derived Planck units, some of which in fact are seldom used. As with the base units, their use is mostly confined to theoretical physics because most of them are too large or too small for empirical or practical use and there are large uncertainties in their values.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; background:#fff;\"\n|+ Table 3: Derived Planck units\n|-\n!

In fact, 1 Planck unit is often the largest or smallest value of a physical quantity that makes sense within present-day theories of physics. For example, our understanding of the [[Big Bang]] begins with the [[Chronology of the universe#Planck epoch|Planck epoch]], when the universe was 1 Planck time old and 1 Planck length in diameter. Understanding the universe when it was less than 1 Planck time old requires a theory of [[quantum gravity]] that would incorporate quantum effects into [[general relativity]]. Such a theory does not yet exist.\n\nAn exception to the general pattern of Planck units being \"extreme\" in magnitude is the [[Planck mass]], which is about [[1 E-8 kg|22 micrograms]]: very large compared to subatomic particles, but well within the mass range of living things.\n\n== Significance ==\nPlanck units have little [[anthropocentric]] arbitrariness, but do still involve some arbitrary choices in terms of the defining constants. Unlike the [[metre]] and [[second]], which exist as [[SI base unit|base units]] in the [[SI]] system for historical reasons, the [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] are conceptually linked at a fundamental physical level. Consequently, natural units help physicists to reframe questions. [[Frank Wilczek]] puts it succinctly:\n{{bq|We see that the question [posed] is not, \"Why is gravity so feeble?\" but rather, \"Why is the proton's mass so small?\" For in natural (Planck) units, the strength of gravity simply is what it is, a primary quantity, while the proton's mass is the tiny number [1/(13&nbsp;[[Names of large numbers|quintillion]])].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scaling Mount Planck I: A View from the Bottom|journal=Physics Today|volume=54|issue=6|pages=12\u201313|year=2001|last=Wilczek|first=Frank|doi=10.1063/1.1387576|bibcode=2001PhT....54f..12W}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile it is true that the electrostatic repulsive force between two protons (alone in free space) greatly exceeds the gravitational attractive force between the same two protons, this is not about the relative strengths of the two fundamental forces. From the point of view of Planck units, this is [[comparing apples to oranges]], because [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] are [[Dimensional analysis|incommensurable]] quantities. Rather, the disparity of magnitude of force is a manifestation of the fact that the [[elementary charge|charge on the protons]] is approximately the [[Planck charge|unit charge]] but the [[Proton mass|mass of the protons]] is far less than the [[Planck mass|unit mass]].\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Chronology of the Universe}}\n{{anchor|Planck epoch}}\nIn [[Big Bang cosmology]], the '''Planck epoch''' or '''Planck era''' is the earliest stage of the [[Big Bang]], before the [[cosmic time|time passed]] was equal to the [[Planck time]], ''t''<sub>P</sub>, or approximately 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |work=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }} - discusses \"[[Planck time]]\" and \"[[Planck era]]\" at the very beginning of the [[Universe]]</ref> There is no currently available physical theory to describe such short times, and it is not clear in what sense the concept of [[time]] is meaningful for values smaller than the Planck time. It is generally assumed that [[quantum gravity|quantum effects of gravity]] dominate physical interactions at this time scale. At this scale, the [[grand unification|unified force]] of the [[Standard Model]] is assumed to be [[Theory of everything|unified with gravitation]]. Immeasurably [[Planck temperature|hot]] and [[Planck density|dense]], the state of the Planck epoch was succeeded by the [[grand unification epoch]], where gravitation is separated from the unified force of the Standard Model, in turn followed by the [[inflationary epoch]], which ended after about 10<sup>\u221232</sup> seconds (or about 10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;''t''<sub>P</sub>).<ref name=\"KolbTurner1994\">{{cite book|author1=Edward W.

The Planck units are based on the quantum of action, now usually known as [[Planck's constant]]. Planck called the constant ''b'' in his paper, though ''h'' (or ''\u0127'') is now common. However, at that time it was entering Wien's radiation law which Planck thought to be correct. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:\n{{bq|''...ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr alle Zeiten und f\u00fcr alle, auch au\u00dferirdische und au\u00dfermenschliche Kulturen notwendig behalten und welche daher als \u00bbnat\u00fcrliche Ma\u00dfeinheiten\u00ab bezeichnet werden k\u00f6nnen...''\n...These necessarily retain their meaning for all times and for all civilizations, even extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and can therefore be designated as \"natural units\"...}}\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units. However, since the [[Gaussian units#\"Rationalized\" unit systems|non-rationalized]] gravitational constant, ''G'', is set to 1, a natural extension of Planck units to a unit of [[electric charge]] is to also set the non-rationalized Coulomb constant, ''k''<sub>e</sub>, to 1 as well.<ref name=\"PAV\">{{cite book|last=Pav\u0161ic|first=Matej|title=The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View|volume=119|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-0-7923-7006-2|pages=347\u2013352|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402003516#otherversion=9780792370062|series=Fundamental Theories of Physics | doi = 10.1007/0-306-47136-1 |arxiv=gr-qc/0610061}}</ref> Another convention is to use the [[elementary charge]] as the basic unit of [[electric charge]] in the Planck system.<ref name=\"Tolin1999\">{{cite journal | title=Fine-structure constant and dimension analysis | author=Tomilin, K. | journal=Eur.

This, along with the concept of [[flux]], are the basis for the [[inverse-square law]], [[Gauss's law]], and the [[divergence]] operator applied to [[flux density]]. For example, [[Gravitational field|gravitational]] and [[electrostatic field]]s produced by point charges have spherical symmetry (Barrow 2002: 214\u201315). The 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> appearing in the denominator of Coulomb's law in [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units#Maxwell's equations with sources|rationalized form]], for example, follows from the flux of an electrostatic field being distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere. Likewise for Newton's law of universal gravitation. (If space had more than three spatial dimensions, the factor 4{{pi}} would have to be changed according to the geometry of the [[S\u00b2|sphere in higher dimensions]].)\n\nHence a substantial body of physical theory developed since Planck (1899) suggests normalizing not ''G'' but either 4{{pi}}''G'' (or 8{{pi}}''G'' or 16{{pi}}''G'') to 1. Doing so would introduce a factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} (or {{sfrac|8{{pi}}}} or {{sfrac|16{{pi}}}}) into the nondimensionalized form of the law of universal gravitation, consistent with the modern rationalized formulation of Coulomb's law in terms of the vacuum permittivity. In fact, alternative normalizations frequently preserve the factor of {{sfrac|4{{pi}}}} in the nondimensionalized form of Coulomb's law as well, so that the nondimensionalized Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism and [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] both take the same form as those for electromagnetism in SI, which do not have any factors of 4{{pi}}.  When this is applied to electromagnetic constants, ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>, this unit system is called ''\"rationalized\"'' [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]].  When applied additionally to gravitation and Planck units, these are called '''rationalized Planck units'''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kaluza-Klein Monopole|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=51|issue=2|pages=87\u201390|year=1983|last=Sorkin|first=Rafael|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.87|bibcode=1983PhRvL..51...87S}}</ref> and are seen in [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wUFoP7HC38C&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=elementary+charge+0.3028 high-energy physics].\n\nThe rationalized Planck units are defined so that <math>c=4\\pi G=\\hbar=\\varepsilon_0=k_\\text{B}=1</math>.\n\nThere are several possible alternative normalizations.\n\n=== Gravity ===\n<!-- [[Reduced Planck units]], [[Planck mass]] and [[Cosmological constant]] link to this section -->\nIn 1899, Newton's law of universal gravitation was still seen as exact, rather than as a convenient approximation holding for \"small\" velocities and masses (the approximate nature of Newton's law was shown following the development of [[general relativity]] in 1915). Hence Planck normalized to 1 the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' in Newton's law. In theories emerging after 1899, ''G'' nearly always appears in formulae multiplied by 4{{pi}} or a small integer multiple thereof. Hence, a choice to be made when designing a system of natural units is which, if any, instances of 4{{pi}} appearing in the equations of physics are to be eliminated via the normalization.\n* Normalizing 4{{pi}}''G'' to 1:\n:* [[Gauss's law for gravity]] becomes {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u2212''M''}} (rather than {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6''<sub>'''g'''</sub> = \u22124{{pi}}''M''}} in Planck units).\n:* Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' from the [[Poisson equation]].\n:* Eliminates 4{{pi}}''G'' in the [[Gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitoelectromagnetic]] (GEM) equations, which hold in weak [[gravitational field]]s or [[Locally flat spacetime|locally flat space-time]]. These equations have the same form as Maxwell's equations (and the [[Lorentz force]] equation) of [[electromagnetism]], with [[mass density]] replacing [[charge density]], and with {{sfrac|4{{pi}}''G''}} replacing ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>.\n:* Normalizes the [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''<sub>0</sub> of [[gravitational radiation]] in free space to 1.

Such cosmologies have not gained mainstream acceptance and yet there is still considerable scientific interest in the possibility that physical \"constants\" might change, although such propositions introduce difficult questions. Perhaps the first question to address is: How would such a change make a noticeable operational difference in physical measurement or, more fundamentally, our perception of reality? If some particular physical constant had changed, how would we notice it, or how would physical reality be different? Which changed constants result in a meaningful and measurable difference in physical reality? If a [[physical constant]] that is not [[dimensionless]], such as the [[speed of light]], ''did'' in fact change, would we be able to notice it or measure it unambiguously? \u2013 a question examined by [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]] in his paper \"Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants\".<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\">{{cite arXiv|author=Michael Duff |title=Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants|eprint=hep-th/0208093|year=2002|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)}}</ref><ref name=\"hep-th1412.2040\">{{cite book|author=Michael Duff |title=How fundamental are fundamental constants?|arxiv=1412.2040|year=2014|author-link=Michael Duff (physicist)|doi=10.1080/00107514.2014.980093|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n[[George Gamow]] argued in his book ''[[Mr Tompkins in Wonderland]]'' that a sufficient change in a dimensionful physical constant, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, would result in obvious perceptible changes. But this idea is challenged:\n\n{{quotation|[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like ''\u03b1'' define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by ''\u03b1'' is a combination of the electron charge, ''e'', the speed of light, ''c'', and Planck's constant, ''h''. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If ''c'', ''h'', and ''e'' were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of ''\u03b1'' remained the same, this new world would be ''observationally indistinguishable'' from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value [including the Planck mass ''m''<sub>P</sub>&nbsp;] you cannot tell because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.|Barrow 2002<ref name=\"John D 2002\" />}}\n\nReferring to Duff's \"Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants\"<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\" /> and Duff, Okun, and [[Gabriele Veneziano|Veneziano]]'s paper \"Trialogue on the number of fundamental constants\",<ref name=\"DOV\">{{cite journal | last1 = Duff | first1 = Michael | authorlink = Michael Duff (physicist) | authorlink3 = Gabriele Veneziano | last2 = Okun | first2 = Lev | last3 = Veneziano | first3 = Gabriele | year = 2002 | title = Trialogue on the number of fundamental constants | arxiv=physics/0110060 | journal = [[Journal of High Energy Physics]] | volume = 2002 | issue = 3| page = 023 |bibcode = 2002JHEP...03..023D |doi = 10.1088/1126-6708/2002/03/023 }}</ref> particularly the section entitled \"The operationally indistinguishable world of Mr. Tompkins\", if all physical quantities (masses and other properties of particles) were expressed in terms of Planck units, those quantities would be dimensionless numbers (mass divided by the Planck mass, length divided by the Planck length, etc.) and the only quantities that we ultimately measure in physical experiments or in our perception of reality are dimensionless numbers. When one commonly measures a length with a ruler or tape-measure, that person is actually counting tick marks on a given standard or is measuring the length relative to that given standard, which is a dimensionless value. It is no different for physical experiments, as all physical quantities are measured relative to some other like-dimensioned quantity.\n\nWe can notice a difference if some dimensionless physical quantity such as [[fine-structure constant]], ''\u03b1'', changes or the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]], {{sfrac|''m''<sub>p</sub>|''m''<sub>e</sub>}}, changes (atomic structures would change) but if all dimensionless physical quantities remained unchanged (this includes all possible ratios of identically dimensioned physical quantity), we cannot tell if a dimensionful quantity, such as the [[speed of light]], ''c'', has changed. And, indeed, the Tompkins concept becomes meaningless in our perception of reality if a dimensional quantity such as ''c'' [[Variable speed of light|has changed]], even drastically.\n\nIf the speed of light ''c'', were somehow suddenly cut in half and changed to {{sfrac|2}}''c'' (but with the axiom that ''all'' dimensionless physical quantities remain the same), then the Planck length would ''increase'' by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}} from the point of view of some unaffected observer on the outside. Measured by \"mortal\" observers in terms of Planck units, the new speed of light would remain as 1 new Planck length per 1 new Planck time \u2013 which is no different from the old measurement. But, since by axiom, the size of atoms (approximately the [[Bohr radius]]) are related to the Planck length by an unchanging dimensionless constant of proportionality:\n\n: <math>a_0 = \\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = \\frac{m_\\text{P}}{m_e \\alpha} l_\\text{P}. </math>\n\nThen atoms would be bigger (in one dimension) by 2{{sqrt|2}}, each of us would be taller by 2{{sqrt|2}}, and so would our metre sticks be taller (and wider and thicker) by a factor of 2{{sqrt|2}}. Our perception of distance and lengths relative to the Planck length is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant.\n\nOur clocks would tick slower by a factor of 4{{sqrt|2}} (from the point of view of this unaffected observer on the outside) because the Planck time has increased by 4{{sqrt|2}} but we would not know the difference (our perception of durations of time relative to the Planck time is, by axiom, an unchanging dimensionless constant). This hypothetical unaffected observer on the outside might observe that light now propagates at half the speed that it previously did (as well as all other observed velocities) but it would still travel {{val|299792458}} of our ''new'' metres in the time elapsed by one of our ''new'' seconds ({{sfrac|2}}''c'' \u00d7 4{{sqrt|2}} \u00f7 2{{sqrt|2}} continues to equal {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}). We would not notice any difference.\n\nThis contradicts what [[George Gamow]] writes in his book ''[[Mr. Tompkins]]''; there, Gamow suggests that if a dimension-dependent universal constant such as ''c'' changed significantly, we ''would'' easily notice the difference. The disagreement is better thought of as the ambiguity in the phrase ''\"changing a physical constant\"''; what would happen depends on whether (1)&nbsp;all other ''dimensionless'' constants were kept the same, or whether (2)&nbsp;all other dimension-''dependent'' constants are kept the same. The second choice is a somewhat confusing possibility, since most of our units of measurement are defined in relation to the outcomes of physical experiments, and the experimental results depend on the constants. Gamow does not address this subtlety; the thought experiments he conducts in his popular works assume the second choice for ''\"changing a physical constant\"''. And Duff or Barrow would point out that ascribing a change in measurable reality, i.e. [[fine-structure constant|''\u03b1'']], to a specific dimensional component quantity, such as [[speed of light|''c'']], is unjustified. The very same operational difference in measurement or perceived reality could just as well be caused by a change in [[Planck constant|''h'']] or [[elementary charge|''e'']] if ''\u03b1'' is changed and no other dimensionless constants are changed.  It is only the dimensionless physical constants that ultimately matter in the definition of worlds.<ref name=\"hep-th0208093\" /><ref>[[John Baez]] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There?]</ref>\n\nThis unvarying aspect of the Planck-relative scale, or that of any other system of natural units, leads many theorists to conclude that a hypothetical change in dimensionful physical constants can only be manifest as a change in [[dimensionless physical constant]]s.

She received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[education]] from [[Augusta State University|Augusta College]] in 1972, after which she worked as a teacher and in other educational jobs until her election as superintendent.\n\n== As superintendent ==\nIn 1994, Schrenko, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent to be elected as Superintendent of Schools, becoming the first woman, and first Republican elected to statewide office in Georgia. She was re-elected in 1998. \n\nDuring her tenure, she generated controversy by advocating the teaching of [[creationism]] in schools and so  was often in conflict with [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] [[Roy Barnes]]. She also came under harsh criticism for creating the Georgia Criterion Referenced Competency Test.\n\n== Campaign for governor ==\nIn 2002, Schrenko sought the Republican nomination for governor of Georgia against Bill Byrne and [[Sonny Perdue]].  Schrenko and Byrne were defeated by Perdue, who avoided a runoff by claiming a majority of the primary votes.\n\n== Criminal conviction ==\nThe 2002 gubernatorial race would lead to Schrenko's downfall. She stole $600,000 in federal funds set aside for educational services for deaf children and those in the governor's honors programs. With the help of her deputy,campaign manager and lover Merle Temple, Schrenko funneled the money into her campaign.<ref name=\"theft\" />\n\nOn November 10, 2004, Schrenko was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges stemming from the 2002 embezzlement. The indictment alleged that a substantial portion of the funds in question had been used to fund Schrenko's campaign for governor and facial [[plastic surgery]].<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/0425metschrenko.html Schrenko jury to be selected, April 25, 2006, ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', by Beth Warren]</ref><ref>{{cite news | publisher = edweek.org | date =  May 11, 2006 | title = Former Georgia Schools Chief Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Money Laundering | author = Linda Jacobson | url = https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/05/17/37schrenko.h25.html }}</ref>\n\nShe pleaded guilty to fraud and [[money laundering]], and was sentenced to eight years in prison on July 12, 2006.

The sole species, '''''Lodoicea maldivica''''', is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[Praslin]] and [[Curieuse]] in the [[Seychelles]]. It formerly also was found on the small islets of St Pierre, Chauve-Souris and Ile Ronde (Round Island), all located near Praslin, but had become extinct there for a time until recently reintroduced. The name of the genus, ''Lodoicea'', may be derived from ''Lodoicus'', the [[Latin]]ised form of ''Louis'', in honour of King [[Louis XV of France]]. Other sources say that ''Lodoicea'' is from [[Laodice (daughter of Priam)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]]. <ref>John Craig,''A new universal etymological technological, and pronouncing dictionary of the English language'' 1859</ref> \n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coco de mer - BOT.2007.26.21.jpg|left|thumb|Nut, with affixed label designating its origin]]\n[[Image:Cocodemerforest.jpg|right|thumb|The Vall\u00e9e De Mai palm forest in Praslin]]\n\nThe tree generally grows to 25\u201334 m tall.

Physical education was a major way girls exercised and practiced team sports on a daily basis. They did not have access to sports or clubs or even really free time compared to men. Men were prepared for war and women were prepared for motherhood. They were prepared to not only be a mother, but also an attractive wife. They can\u2019t gain much weight and are not allowed to be muscular. Homophbia was also a major role, they would be less feminine and maybe gay because their playing a manly game. Eventually, because Latin America had been sending girls over to Britain to adopt their cultures, they found that British Victorian culture expressed that it was acceptable for women to become interested and play tennis because it wasn\u2019t so manly. It did not involve direct contact and was not seen to be difficult to play, so women wouldn't become manly. As men took over physical education, female physical education teachers were pushed out. Those same teachers that also ran the local Olympic committee and the federations were kicked out of those positions as well. Chilean sprinter Adrianna Millard, dismissed another fellow woman who was the start of the London  Olympics 1948, because she said that she \u201cran and jumped like a man\u201d. Not only were men dismissing women, but women were dismissing other women. Women were so brainwashed and held to such standards that most women didn\u2019t have respect for themselves or other women because of the standards men have been holding women to. The earliest women soccer teams around 1900 in Chile were very violent. A cartoonist made a joke that a woman entered the stadium with short hair and make-up on. While she was there she was hit in the face with the ball and the joke was that her makeup had made a replica of her face on the ball. The fact that a woman got hit in the face with a ball during a game for entering a stadium and having a full face of makeup was funny. \n\n\n\n==Popularity==\nFootball has had to compete with a number of sports that are more popular with women across the continent, including track and field, netball, basketball, team handball and other sports.<ref name=\"Alegi2010p119\"/> The masculine nature of football has proved a deterrent to women's involvement in football in Africa.<ref name=\"Alegi2010p119\">{{cite book|author=Peter Alegi|title=African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World's Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrW50yHkr0EC|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=2 March 2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-89680-278-0|page=119}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhile women were not always playing the game, they supported Footballs development by the 1920s women took on support roles that freed up time and resources which allowed men to actively participate.<ref name=\"Alegi2010p15\">{{cite book|author=Peter Alegi|title=African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World's Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrW50yHkr0EC|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=2 March 2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-89680-278-0|page=15}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2012}} During the 1960s in South Africa, women began to emerge as leaders in the sport, taking on leadership positions in fan clubs.<ref name=\"Alegi2010p15\"/>\n\n==Fans==\nSingle women were attending games by the 1960s.<ref name=\"Alegi2010p15\"/>{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\n==National teams==\nBefore 1985 across the globe very few countries had a national women's football team.<ref name=\"McDougall2012\">{{cite book|author=Chr\u00f6s McDougall|title=Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nrhG5ovUSQC&pg=PA45|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61783-146-1|page=45}}</ref> In Africa, this was true with for many countries including Burundi and Madagascar with their senior national sides having yet to play a FIFA sanctioned match.<ref name=nofifano>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=mad/fixturesresults/gender=f/index.html |title=Madagascar: Fixtures and Results |publisher=FIFA |date= |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=burudiniii>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=bdi/fixturesresults/gender=f/index.html |title=Burundi: Fixtures and Results |publisher=FIFA |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Sports|Association football}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Women's football in Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Association football in Africa]]\n", "text_old": "::''For more in depth, albeit general information see [[Football in Africa]].''\n\n{{Infobox sport overview\n| boxwidth      = 250\n| title         = Women's football in Africa\n| image         = \n| imagesize     = 240px\n| image_alt     = <!-- alt text, which will be seen when hovering over the image -->\n| caption       = \n| union         = [[Confederation of African Football]]\n| country       = \n| sport         = association football\n| noncountry    = <!-- other country this country represents -->\n| teamlabel1    = <!-- overrides the \"National team\" label with custom label -->\n| nationalteam  = \n| teamlabel2    = <!-- overrides the \"Representative team\" label with customer label -->\n| repteam       = <!-- overrides the representative team link, requires full wikitext syntax -->\n| nickname      = <!-- nicknames -->\n| first         = \n| registered    = \n| clubs         = \n| national_list =  \n| club_list     =\n| intl_list     = [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] <br>[[FIFA Women's World Cup]](National Team)<br> [[Africa Women Cup of Nations]](National Team)\n| match         = \n| league        = \n}}\n\n'''Women's football in Africa''' can be divided into distinct historical periods.
