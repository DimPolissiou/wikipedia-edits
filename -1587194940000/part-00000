During its introduction, it was described simply as \"Objective-C without the C\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/news/527821/apple-seeks-a-swift-way-to-lure-more-developers|title=Apple Seeks a Swift Way to Lure More Developers|first1=Rachel|last1=Metz|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=[[Technology Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/apple-introduces-a-new-programming-language-swift-objective-c-without-the-c/|title=Apple announces 'Swift,' a new programming language for macOS & iOS|first1=Harrison|last1=Weber|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref>\n\nBy default, Swift does not expose pointers and other [[Memory safety|unsafe]] [[Mutator method|accessors]], in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use of a [[Smalltalk]]-like syntax for making [[method call]]s has been replaced with a dot-notation style and [[namespace]] system more familiar to programmers from other common [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Swift introduces true [[named parameter]]s and retains key Objective-C concepts, including [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]] and [[Objective-C#Categories|categories]], often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like [[enumerated type]]s (enums)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://themindstudios.com/blog/advantages-of-using-swift-over-objective-c/ | title=Advantages Of Using Swift | website=themindstudios.com | accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>\n=== Closure Support===\nSwift supports closures (known as lambdas in other languages). Here is an example:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\">/// Here is a closure\n{(arg1: Int, arg2: Int) -> Int in\nreturn arg1 + arg2\n}</source>\nSwift has a trailing closure syntax like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\"> // This function takes a closure or function that returns an int and then just evaluates the function.\nfunc a(closure a: () -> Int) -> Int {\nreturn a()\n}\n\n/// Without trailing closure syntax\n\na(closure: {return 1})\n\n/// With trailing closure syntax\na {return 1} </source>\nYou must omit the parameter names.\n\n'''Here is criteria for the trailing closure syntax:'''\n\n# If the function only has one parameter and it is a closure you can use the trailing closure syntax\n# If the parameter at the end is a closure than you can use the trailing closure syntax\n\n=== String support===\nUnder the [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] and [[Cocoa Touch]] environments, many common classes were part of the [[Foundation Kit]] library. This included the NSString string library (using [[Unicode]]), the NSArray and NSDictionary collection classes, and others. Objective-C provided various bits of [[syntactic sugar]] to allow some of these objects to be created on-the-fly within the language, but once created, the objects were manipulated with object calls. For instance, in Objective-C concatenating two NSStrings required method calls similar to this: \n \n<source lang=\"objc\">NSString *str = @\"hello,\";\nstr = [str stringByAppendingString:@\" world\"];</source> In Swift, many of these basic types have been promoted to the language's core, and can be manipulated directly. For instance, strings are invisibly bridged to NSString (when Foundation is imported) and can now be concatenated with the <code>+</code> operator, allowing greatly simplified syntax; the prior example becoming:<ref>{{cite web|title=Strings and Characters|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/StringsAndCharacters.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">var str = \"hello,\"\nstr += \" world\"</source>\n\n=== Access control ===\nSwift supports five [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|access control]] levels for symbols: <code>open</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>fileprivate</code>, and <code>private</code>. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] hierarchies: <code>private</code> indicates that a symbol is accessible only in the immediate scope, <code>fileprivate</code> indicates it is accessible only from within the file, <code>internal</code> indicates it is accessible within the containing module, <code>public</code> indicates it is accessible from any module, and <code>open</code> (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class may be subclassed outside of the module.<ref>{{cite web|title=Access Control|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AccessControl.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Optionals and chaining ===\nAn important new feature in Swift is [[option type]]s, which allow [[Reference (computer science)|references]] or values to operate in a manner similar to the common pattern in [[C (programming language)|C]], where a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] may refer to a value or may be null. This implies that non-optional types cannot result in a [[Pointer (computer programming)#Making pointers safer|null-pointer error]]; the compiler can ensure this is not possible.\n\nOptional types are created with the <code>Optional</code> mechanism\u2014to make an Integer that is nullable, one would use a declaration similar to <code>var optionalInteger: Optional<Int></code>. As in C#,<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx \"Nullable Types\"], C# Programming Guide, Microsoft.</ref> Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the type name, <code>var optionalInteger: Int?</code>.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/Types.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are <code>nil</code>. Optional types ''wrap'' the base type, resulting in a different instance. <code>String</code> and <code>String?</code> are fundamentally different types, the latter has more in common with <code>Int?</code> than <code>String</code>.\n\nTo access the value inside, assuming it is not nil, it must be ''unwrapped'' to expose the instance inside. This is performed with the <code>!</code> operator:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance!.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case, the <code>!</code> operator unwraps <code>anOptionalInstance</code> to expose the instance inside, allowing the method call to be made on it. If <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is nil, a null-pointer error occurs. This can be annoying in practice, so Swift also includes the concept of [[Safe navigation operator|optional chaining]] to test whether the instance is nil and then unwrap it if it is non-null:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance?.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case the runtime only calls <code>someMethod</code> if <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is not nil, suppressing the error. Normally this requires the programmer to test whether <code>myValue</code> is nil before proceeding. The origin of the term ''chaining'' comes from the more common case where several method calls/getters are chained together. For instance:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet aTenant = aBuilding.TenantList[5]\nlet theirLease = aTenant.leaseDetails\nlet leaseStart = theirLease?.startDate\n</source>\n\ncan be reduced to:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5].leaseDetails?.startDate\n</source>\n\nThe <code>?</code> syntax circumvents the [[Pyramid of doom (programming)|pyramid of doom]].\n\nSwift 2 introduced the new keyword <code>guard</code> for cases in which code should stop executing if some condition is unmet:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nguard let leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5]?.leaseDetails?.startDate else\n{\n    //handle the error case where anything in the chain is nil\n    //else scope must exit the current method or loop\n}\n//continue, knowing that leaseStart is not nil\n</source>\n\nUsing <code>guard</code> has three benefits. While the syntax can act as an <code>if</code> statement, its primary benefit is inferring non-nullability. Where an <code>if</code> statement requires a case, <code>guard</code> assumes the case based on the condition provided. Also, since <code>guard</code> contains no scope, with exception of the <code>else</code> closure, <code>leaseStart</code> is presented as an unwrapped optional to the guard's super-scope. Lastly, if the <code>guard</code> statement's test fails, Swift requires the <code>else</code> to exit the current method or loop, ensuring <code>leaseStart</code> never is accessed when <code>nil</code>. This is performed with the keywords <code>return</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>throw</code>.\n\nObjective-C was weakly typed and allowed any method to be called on any object at any time. If the method call failed, there was a default handler in the runtime that returned nil. That meant that no unwrapping or testing was needed, the equivalent statement in Objective-C:\n\n<source lang=\"objective-c\">\nleaseStart = [[[aBuilding tenantList:5] leaseDetails] startDate]\n</source>\n\nWould return nil, and this could be tested. However, this also demanded that all method calls be dynamic, which introduces significant overhead. Swift's use of optionals provides a similar mechanism for testing and dealing with nils, but does so in a way that allows the compiler to use static dispatch because the unwrapping action is called on a defined instance (the wrapper), versus occurring in the runtime dispatch system.\n\n=== Value types ===\nIn many object-oriented languages, objects are represented internally in two parts. The object is stored as a block of data placed on the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]], while the name (or \"handle\") to that object is represented by a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. Objects are passed between methods by copying the value of the pointer, allowing the same underlying data on the heap to be accessed by anyone with a copy. In contrast, basic types like integers and floating-point values are represented directly; the handle contains the data, not a pointer to it, and that data is passed directly to methods by copying. These styles of access are termed ''pass-by-reference'' in the case of objects, and ''pass-by-value'' for basic types.\n\nBoth concepts have their advantages and disadvantages. Objects are useful when the data is large, like the description of a window or the contents of a document. In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one [[Word (computer architecture)|word]]), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these basic value types, like mathematics.\n\nSimilarly to C# and in contrast to most other OO languages,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Swift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the <code>class</code> declaration and the latter using <code>struct</code>. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as ''instances'', versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.<ref name=classesstructs>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html |title= Classes and Structures |website=Apple.com}}</ref>\n\nThe programmer is free to choose which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, can be defined as structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including <code>Int</code> and <code>Double</code>, and types normally represented by objects, like <code>String</code> and <code>Array</code>.<ref name=classesstructs/> Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@fielgood/swift-1-1-swift-1-2-and-objective-c-a-performance-case-study-d86f7a333e2a |title=Performance Case Study on Swift 1.1, Swift 1.2, and Objective-C |first=Fiel |last=Guhit}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that even the largest structs do not cause a performance penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses [[copy on write]] so that the objects are copied only if and when the program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors have what is in effect a pointer to the same data storage. So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, at the level of the application, these values are separate and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=414 |title=Building Better Apps with Value Types |publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol-oriented programming ===\nA key feature of Objective-C is its support for ''categories'', methods that can be added to extend classes at runtime. Categories allow extending classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original [[source code]]. An example might be to add [[spell checker]] support to the base <code>NSString</code> class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed ''extensions'', and declared with the keyword <code>extension</code>. Unlike Objective-C, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types, and enums to extant instances {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.\n\nAnother key feature of Objective-C is its use of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|''protocols'']], known in most modern languages as ''interfaces''. Protocols promise that a particular class implements a set of methods, meaning that other objects in the system can call those methods on any object supporting that protocol. This is often used in modern OO languages as a substitute for [[multiple inheritance]], although the feature sets are not entirely similar. A common example of a protocol in Cocoa is the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol, which defines one method, <code>copyWithZone</code>, that implements [[object copying#deep copy|deep copying]] on objects.<ref name=protocols>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/index.html |title= NSCopying Protocol Reference |website=Apple}}</ref>\n\nIn Objective-C, and most other languages implementing the protocol concept, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html |title=Working with Protocols |website=Apple}}</ref> Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use [[generic programming]] (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.<ref name=protocols/>\n\nFor example, a protocol might be declared called <code>StringConvertible</code>, which ensures that instances that conform to the protocol implement a <code>toString</code> method that returns a <code>String</code>. In Swift, this can be declared with code like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nprotocol StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n}\n</source>\nThis protocol can now be added to String, with no access to the base class's source:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nextension String: StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n    {\n        self\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\nIn Swift, like many modern languages supporting interfaces, protocols can be used as types, which means variables and methods can be defined by protocol instead of their specific type:\n\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nvar someSortOfPrintableObject: StringConvertible\n...\nprint(someSortOfPrintableObject.toString())\n</source>\n\nIt does not matter what sort of instance <code>someSortOfPrintableObject</code> is, the compiler will ensure that it conforms to the protocol and thus this code is safe. This syntax also means that collections can be based on protocols also, like <code>let printableArray = [StringConvertible]</code>.\n\nAs Swift treats structs and classes as similar concepts, both extensions and protocols are extensively used in Swift's runtime to provide a rich API based on structs. For instance, Swift uses an extension to add the <code>Equatable</code> protocol to many of their basic types, like Strings and Arrays, allowing them to be compared with the <code>==</code> operator. A concrete example of how all of these features interact can be seen in the concept of ''default protocol implementations'':\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nfunc !=<T : Equatable>(lhs: T, rhs: T) -> Bool\n</source>\nThis function defines a method that works on any instance conforming to <code>Equatable</code>, providing a ''not equals'' function. Any instance, class or struct, automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to <code>Equatable</code>. As many instances gain <code>Equatable</code> through their base implementations or other generic extensions, most basic objects in the runtime gain equals and not equals with no code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/ |title=Swift Default Protocol Implementations |website=NSHipster |first=Mattt |last=Thompson |date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis combination of protocols, defaults, protocol inheritance, and extensions allows many of the functions normally associated with classes and inheritance to be implemented on value types.<ref name=protocols/> Properly used, this can lead to dramatic performance improvements with no significant limits in API. This concept is so widely used within Swift, that Apple has begun calling it a ''protocol-oriented programming language''. They suggest addressing many of the problem domains normally solved though classes and inheritance using protocols and structs instead.\n\n=== Libraries, runtime and development ===\nOn Apple systems, Swift uses the same runtime as the extant [[Objective-C]] system, but requires iOS 7 or macOS 10.9 or higher. It also depends on [[Grand Central Dispatch]].<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001778/do-swift-based-apps-work-on-os-x-10-9-ios-7-and-lower/24038997#24038997 \"Do Swift-based apps work on macOS 10.9/iOS 7 and lower?\"], StackOverflow</ref> Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. In contrast to C, [[C++]] code cannot be used directly from Swift. An Objective-C or C wrapper must be created between Swift and C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html|title=Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C: Basic Setup|date=January 6, 2015|work=apple.com}}</ref> In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WritingSwiftClassesWithObjective-CBehavior.html \"Writing Swift Classes with Objective-C Behavior\"], Apple Inc.</ref> The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html|title=Migrating Your Objective-C Code to Swift}}</ref>\n\nTo aid development of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 and higher offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a ''bridging header'' to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This takes the form of an additional [[header file]] that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called \"MyApp\" could access Swift classes or functions with the code <code>#import \"MyApp-Swift.h\"</code>. Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however\u2014use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_77 \"Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project\"], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\nSwift also has limited support for ''attributes'', metadata that is read by the development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the <code>@</code> syntax, but the currently available set is small. One example is the <code>@IBOutlet</code> attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an ''outlet'', available for use within [[Interface Builder]] (IB). An ''outlet'' is a device that binds the value of the on-screen display to an object in code.\n\nOn non-Apple systems, Swift does not depend on an Objective-C runtime or other Apple system libraries; a set of Swift \"Corelib\" implementations replace them. These include a \"swift-corelibs-foundation\" to stand in for the [[Foundation Kit]], a \"swift-corelibs-libdispatch\" to stand in for the Grand Central Dispatch, and an \"swift-corelibs-xctest\" to stand in for the XCTest APIs from [[XCode]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple: search \"corelib\" |url=https://github.com/apple?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=corelibs&type=&language= |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory management ===\nSwift uses [[Automatic Reference Counting]] (ARC) to [[Memory management|manage memory]]. Apple used to require manual memory management in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 to allow for easier memory allocation and deallocation.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html \"Automatic Reference Counting\"], Apple Inc.</ref> One problem with ARC is the possibility of creating a ''[[Reference counting#reference cycle|strong reference cycle]]'', where objects reference each other in a way that you can reach the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. Swift provides the keywords <code>weak</code> and <code>unowned</code> to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either <code>weak</code> reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or <code>unowned</code> where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become <code>nil</code>.<ref name=\"Intermediate Swift\">{{cite web|last1=Lanier|first1=Brian|last2=Groff|first2=Joe|title=Intermediate Swift|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?include=403#403|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA closure within a class can also create a strong reference cycle by capturing self references. Self references to be treated as weak or unowned can be indicated using a ''capture list.''\n\n=== Debugging and other elements ===\nA key element of the Swift system is its ability to be cleanly debugged and run within the development environment, using a [[read\u2013eval\u2013print loop]] (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional [[system programming]] languages. The REPL is further enhanced with the new concept ''[[Swift Playgrounds|playgrounds]]''. These are interactive views running within the Xcode environment that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Why Coders Are Going Nuts Over Apple's New Programming Language|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/apple-swift-language/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Swift Playgrounds|Playgrounds]] allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, step through and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.\n\nApple says that Swift is \"an industrial-quality programming language that's as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language\".<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ About Swift], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nMany of the features introduced with Swift have well-known performance and safety trade-offs. Apple has implemented [[Optimizing compiler|optimizations]] that reduce this overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/409/ |title=Optimizing Swift Performance |publisher=Apple, Inc. |date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons to other languages ==\n\nSwift is similar to C in various ways:\n\n* Most C operators are used in Swift, but there are some new operators, for example to support integer operations with overflow (see under differences).\n* [[Curly braces]] are used to group statements.\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]]. A new identity operator, ===, is provided to check if two data elements refer to the same [[Pointer (computing)|object]].\n* Control statements <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, and <code>switch</code> are similar, but have extended functions, e.g., a <code>switch</code> that takes non-integer cases, <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> supporting pattern matching and conditionally unwrapping optionals, etc.\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\nIt also has similarities to Objective-C:\n\n* Basic numeric types (<code>Int, UInt, Float, Double</code>)\n* Class methods are inherited, like instance methods; <code>self</code> in class methods is the class the method was called on.\n* Similar <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> enumeration syntax.\n\nDifferences from Objective-C include:\n\n* Statements do not need to end with semicolons (<code>;</code>), though these must be used to allow more than one statement on a line.\n* No header files.\n* Uses [[type inference]].\n* [[Generic programming]].\n* Functions are [[first class function|first-class]] objects.\n* Enumeration cases can have associated data ([[algebraic data type]]s).\n* Operators can be redefined for classes ([[operator overloading]]), and new operators can be defined.\n* Strings fully support [[Unicode]]. Most Unicode characters can be used in either identifiers or operators.\n* No [[exception handling]]. Swift 2 introduces a different and incompatible error-handling model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/26749528|title=Error-Handling in Swift-Language|work=stackoverflow.com}}</ref>\n* Several notoriously error-prone behaviors of earlier [[List of C-family programming languages|C-family languages]] have been changed:\n** [[Pointer (computer programming)|Pointers]] are not exposed by default. There is no need for the programmer to keep track of and mark names for referencing or dereferencing.\n** Assignments return no value. This prevents the common error of writing <code>i = 0</code> instead of <code>i == 0</code> by throwing a compile-time error.\n** No need to use <code>break</code> statements in <code>[[Switch statement|switch]]</code> blocks. Individual cases do not fall through to the next case unless the <code>fallthrough</code> statement is used.\n** Variables and constants are always initialized and array bounds are always checked.\n** [[Integer overflow]]s, which result in [[undefined behavior]] for signed integers in C, are trapped as a run-time error in Swift. Programmers can choose to allow overflows by using the special arithmetical operators <code>&+</code>, <code>&-</code>, <code>&*</code>, <code>&/</code> and <code>&%</code>. The properties <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are defined in Swift for all integer types and can be used to safely check for potential overflows, versus relying on constants defined for each type in external libraries.\n** The one-statement form of <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, which allows for the omission of braces around the statement, is unsupported.\n** C-style enumeration <code>for (int i = 0; i < c; i++)</code>, which is prone to [[off-by-one error]]s, is unsupported (from Swift 3 onward).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0007-remove-c-style-for-loops.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n** The pre- and post- [[increment and decrement operators]] (<code>i++</code>, <code>--i</code> ...) are unsupported (from Swift 3 onward), more so since C-style <code>for</code> statements are also unsupported from Swift 3 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0004-remove-pre-post-inc-decrement.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Development and other implementations ==\nSince the language is open-source, there are prospects of it being ported to the web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/22/ibm-swift-cloud-kitura/|title=IBM brings Swift to the cloud, releases web framework Kitura written in Apple\u2019s programming language|last=Barbosa|first=Greg|date=February 22, 2016|website=9to5Mac|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Some web frameworks have already been developed, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Kitura]], [[Perfect (server framework)|Perfect]] and [[Vapor (Server-side Swift)|Vapor]].\n\nAn official \"Server APIs\" work group has also been started by Apple,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/|title=Server APIs Work Group|last=Inc.|first=Apple|date=October 25, 2016|newspaper=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> with members of the Swift developer community playing a central role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://swift.org/server-apis/|title=Swift.org|last=Inc.|first=Apple|website=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA second free implementation of Swift that targets [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Common Language Infrastructure]] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]]), and the [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform exists as part of the ''Elements Compiler'' from [[RemObjects Software]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = RemObjects Elements Compiler|url = http://www.elementscompiler.com/silver|accessdate = January 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Objective-C]]\n* [[Kotlin (programming language)]]\n* [[Python (programming language)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://developer.apple.com/swift/ Swift] at [[Apple Developer]]\n* {{GitHub|apple/swift|Swift's source code}}\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/swift/ Server-side Swift]\n*[https://iosexample.com/ Swift Example]\n* [https://vapor.codes/ Server-side Swift -

During its introduction, it was described simply as \"Objective-C without the C\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/news/527821/apple-seeks-a-swift-way-to-lure-more-developers|title=Apple Seeks a Swift Way to Lure More Developers|first1=Rachel|last1=Metz|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=[[Technology Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/apple-introduces-a-new-programming-language-swift-objective-c-without-the-c/|title=Apple announces 'Swift,' a new programming language for macOS & iOS|first1=Harrison|last1=Weber|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref>\n\nBy default, Swift does not expose pointers and other [[Memory safety|unsafe]] [[Mutator method|accessors]], in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use of a [[Smalltalk]]-like syntax for making [[method call]]s has been replaced with a dot-notation style and [[namespace]] system more familiar to programmers from other common [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Swift introduces true [[named parameter]]s and retains key Objective-C concepts, including [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]] and [[Objective-C#Categories|categories]], often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like [[enumerated type]]s (enums)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://themindstudios.com/blog/advantages-of-using-swift-over-objective-c/ | title=Advantages Of Using Swift | website=themindstudios.com | accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>\n=== Closure Support===\nSwift supports closures (known as lambdas in other languages). Here is an example:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\">/// Here is a closure\n{(arg1: Int, arg2: Int) -> Int in\nreturn arg1 + arg2\n}</source>\nSwift has a trailing closure syntax like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\"> // This function takes a closure or function that returns an int and then just evaluates the function.\nfunc a(closure a: () -> Int) -> Int {\nreturn a()\n}\n\n/// Without trailing closure syntax\n\na(closure: {return 1})\n\n/// With trailing closure syntax\na {return 1} </source>\nYou must omit the parameter names.\n\n'''Here is criteria for the trailing closure syntax:'''\n\n# If the function only has one parameter and it is a closure you can use the trailing closure syntax\n# If the parameter at the end is a closure than you can use the trailing closure syntax\n\n=== String support===\nUnder the [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] and [[Cocoa Touch]] environments, many common classes were part of the [[Foundation Kit]] library. This included the NSString string library (using [[Unicode]]), the NSArray and NSDictionary collection classes, and others. Objective-C provided various bits of [[syntactic sugar]] to allow some of these objects to be created on-the-fly within the language, but once created, the objects were manipulated with object calls. For instance, in Objective-C concatenating two NSStrings required method calls similar to this: \n \n<source lang=\"objc\">NSString *str = @\"hello,\";\nstr = [str stringByAppendingString:@\" world\"];</source> In Swift, many of these basic types have been promoted to the language's core, and can be manipulated directly. For instance, strings are invisibly bridged to NSString (when Foundation is imported) and can now be concatenated with the <code>+</code> operator, allowing greatly simplified syntax; the prior example becoming:<ref>{{cite web|title=Strings and Characters|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/StringsAndCharacters.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">var str = \"hello,\"\nstr += \" world\"</source>\n\n=== Access control ===\nSwift supports five [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|access control]] levels for symbols: <code>open</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>fileprivate</code>, and <code>private</code>. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] hierarchies: <code>private</code> indicates that a symbol is accessible only in the immediate scope, <code>fileprivate</code> indicates it is accessible only from within the file, <code>internal</code> indicates it is accessible within the containing module, <code>public</code> indicates it is accessible from any module, and <code>open</code> (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class may be subclassed outside of the module.<ref>{{cite web|title=Access Control|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AccessControl.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Optionals and chaining ===\nAn important new feature in Swift is [[option type]]s, which allow [[Reference (computer science)|references]] or values to operate in a manner similar to the common pattern in [[C (programming language)|C]], where a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] may refer to a value or may be null. This implies that non-optional types cannot result in a [[Pointer (computer programming)#Making pointers safer|null-pointer error]]; the compiler can ensure this is not possible.\n\nOptional types are created with the <code>Optional</code> mechanism\u2014to make an Integer that is nullable, one would use a declaration similar to <code>var optionalInteger: Optional<Int></code>. As in C#,<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx \"Nullable Types\"], C# Programming Guide, Microsoft.</ref> Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the type name, <code>var optionalInteger: Int?</code>.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/Types.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are <code>nil</code>. Optional types ''wrap'' the base type, resulting in a different instance. <code>String</code> and <code>String?</code> are fundamentally different types, the latter has more in common with <code>Int?</code> than <code>String</code>.\n\nTo access the value inside, assuming it is not nil, it must be ''unwrapped'' to expose the instance inside. This is performed with the <code>!</code> operator:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance!.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case, the <code>!</code> operator unwraps <code>anOptionalInstance</code> to expose the instance inside, allowing the method call to be made on it. If <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is nil, a null-pointer error occurs. This can be annoying in practice, so Swift also includes the concept of [[Safe navigation operator|optional chaining]] to test whether the instance is nil and then unwrap it if it is non-null:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance?.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case the runtime only calls <code>someMethod</code> if <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is not nil, suppressing the error. Normally this requires the programmer to test whether <code>myValue</code> is nil before proceeding. The origin of the term ''chaining'' comes from the more common case where several method calls/getters are chained together. For instance:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet aTenant = aBuilding.TenantList[5]\nlet theirLease = aTenant.leaseDetails\nlet leaseStart = theirLease?.startDate\n</source>\n\ncan be reduced to:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5].leaseDetails?.startDate\n</source>\n\nThe <code>?</code> syntax circumvents the [[Pyramid of doom (programming)|pyramid of doom]].\n\nSwift 2 introduced the new keyword <code>guard</code> for cases in which code should stop executing if some condition is unmet:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nguard let leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5]?.leaseDetails?.startDate else\n{\n    //handle the error case where anything in the chain is nil\n    //else scope must exit the current method or loop\n}\n//continue, knowing that leaseStart is not nil\n</source>\n\nUsing <code>guard</code> has three benefits. While the syntax can act as an <code>if</code> statement, its primary benefit is inferring non-nullability. Where an <code>if</code> statement requires a case, <code>guard</code> assumes the case based on the condition provided. Also, since <code>guard</code> contains no scope, with exception of the <code>else</code> closure, <code>leaseStart</code> is presented as an unwrapped optional to the guard's super-scope. Lastly, if the <code>guard</code> statement's test fails, Swift requires the <code>else</code> to exit the current method or loop, ensuring <code>leaseStart</code> never is accessed when <code>nil</code>. This is performed with the keywords <code>return</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>throw</code>.\n\nObjective-C was weakly typed and allowed any method to be called on any object at any time. If the method call failed, there was a default handler in the runtime that returned nil. That meant that no unwrapping or testing was needed, the equivalent statement in Objective-C:\n\n<source lang=\"objective-c\">\nleaseStart = [[[aBuilding tenantList:5] leaseDetails] startDate]\n</source>\n\nWould return nil, and this could be tested. However, this also demanded that all method calls be dynamic, which introduces significant overhead. Swift's use of optionals provides a similar mechanism for testing and dealing with nils, but does so in a way that allows the compiler to use static dispatch because the unwrapping action is called on a defined instance (the wrapper), versus occurring in the runtime dispatch system.\n\n=== Value types ===\nIn many object-oriented languages, objects are represented internally in two parts. The object is stored as a block of data placed on the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]], while the name (or \"handle\") to that object is represented by a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. Objects are passed between methods by copying the value of the pointer, allowing the same underlying data on the heap to be accessed by anyone with a copy. In contrast, basic types like integers and floating-point values are represented directly; the handle contains the data, not a pointer to it, and that data is passed directly to methods by copying. These styles of access are termed ''pass-by-reference'' in the case of objects, and ''pass-by-value'' for basic types.\n\nBoth concepts have their advantages and disadvantages. Objects are useful when the data is large, like the description of a window or the contents of a document. In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one [[Word (computer architecture)|word]]), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these basic value types, like mathematics.\n\nSimilarly to C# and in contrast to most other OO languages,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Swift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the <code>class</code> declaration and the latter using <code>struct</code>. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as ''instances'', versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.<ref name=classesstructs>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html |title= Classes and Structures |website=Apple.com}}</ref>\n\nThe programmer is free to choose which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, can be defined as structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including <code>Int</code> and <code>Double</code>, and types normally represented by objects, like <code>String</code> and <code>Array</code>.<ref name=classesstructs/> Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@fielgood/swift-1-1-swift-1-2-and-objective-c-a-performance-case-study-d86f7a333e2a |title=Performance Case Study on Swift 1.1, Swift 1.2, and Objective-C |first=Fiel |last=Guhit}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that even the largest structs do not cause a performance penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses [[copy on write]] so that the objects are copied only if and when the program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors have what is in effect a pointer to the same data storage. So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, at the level of the application, these values are separate and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=414 |title=Building Better Apps with Value Types |publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol-oriented programming ===\nA key feature of Objective-C is its support for ''categories'', methods that can be added to extend classes at runtime. Categories allow extending classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original [[source code]]. An example might be to add [[spell checker]] support to the base <code>NSString</code> class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed ''extensions'', and declared with the keyword <code>extension</code>. Unlike Objective-C, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types, and enums to extant instances {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.\n\nAnother key feature of Objective-C is its use of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|''protocols'']], known in most modern languages as ''interfaces''. Protocols promise that a particular class implements a set of methods, meaning that other objects in the system can call those methods on any object supporting that protocol. This is often used in modern OO languages as a substitute for [[multiple inheritance]], although the feature sets are not entirely similar. A common example of a protocol in Cocoa is the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol, which defines one method, <code>copyWithZone</code>, that implements [[object copying#deep copy|deep copying]] on objects.<ref name=protocols>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/index.html |title= NSCopying Protocol Reference |website=Apple}}</ref>\n\nIn Objective-C, and most other languages implementing the protocol concept, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html |title=Working with Protocols |website=Apple}}</ref> Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use [[generic programming]] (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.<ref name=protocols/>\n\nFor example, a protocol might be declared called <code>StringConvertible</code>, which ensures that instances that conform to the protocol implement a <code>toString</code> method that returns a <code>String</code>. In Swift, this can be declared with code like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nprotocol StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n}\n</source>\nThis protocol can now be added to String, with no access to the base class's source:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nextension String: StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n    {\n        self\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\nIn Swift, like many modern languages supporting interfaces, protocols can be used as types, which means variables and methods can be defined by protocol instead of their specific type:\n\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nvar someSortOfPrintableObject: StringConvertible\n...\nprint(someSortOfPrintableObject.toString())\n</source>\n\nIt does not matter what sort of instance <code>someSortOfPrintableObject</code> is, the compiler will ensure that it conforms to the protocol and thus this code is safe. This syntax also means that collections can be based on protocols also, like <code>let printableArray = [StringConvertible]</code>.\n\nAs Swift treats structs and classes as similar concepts, both extensions and protocols are extensively used in Swift's runtime to provide a rich API based on structs. For instance, Swift uses an extension to add the <code>Equatable</code> protocol to many of their basic types, like Strings and Arrays, allowing them to be compared with the <code>==</code> operator. A concrete example of how all of these features interact can be seen in the concept of ''default protocol implementations'':\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nfunc !=<T : Equatable>(lhs: T, rhs: T) -> Bool\n</source>\nThis function defines a method that works on any instance conforming to <code>Equatable</code>, providing a ''not equals'' function. Any instance, class or struct, automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to <code>Equatable</code>. As many instances gain <code>Equatable</code> through their base implementations or other generic extensions, most basic objects in the runtime gain equals and not equals with no code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/ |title=Swift Default Protocol Implementations |website=NSHipster |first=Mattt |last=Thompson |date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis combination of protocols, defaults, protocol inheritance, and extensions allows many of the functions normally associated with classes and inheritance to be implemented on value types.<ref name=protocols/> Properly used, this can lead to dramatic performance improvements with no significant limits in API. This concept is so widely used within Swift, that Apple has begun calling it a ''protocol-oriented programming language''. They suggest addressing many of the problem domains normally solved though classes and inheritance using protocols and structs instead.\n\n=== Libraries, runtime and development ===\nOn Apple systems, Swift uses the same runtime as the extant [[Objective-C]] system, but requires iOS 7 or macOS 10.9 or higher. It also depends on [[Grand Central Dispatch]].<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001778/do-swift-based-apps-work-on-os-x-10-9-ios-7-and-lower/24038997#24038997 \"Do Swift-based apps work on macOS 10.9/iOS 7 and lower?\"], StackOverflow</ref> Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. In contrast to C, [[C++]] code cannot be used directly from Swift. An Objective-C or C wrapper must be created between Swift and C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html|title=Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C: Basic Setup|date=January 6, 2015|work=apple.com}}</ref> In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WritingSwiftClassesWithObjective-CBehavior.html \"Writing Swift Classes with Objective-C Behavior\"], Apple Inc.</ref> The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html|title=Migrating Your Objective-C Code to Swift}}</ref>\n\nTo aid development of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 and higher offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a ''bridging header'' to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This takes the form of an additional [[header file]] that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called \"MyApp\" could access Swift classes or functions with the code <code>#import \"MyApp-Swift.h\"</code>. Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however\u2014use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_77 \"Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project\"], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\nSwift also has limited support for ''attributes'', metadata that is read by the development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the <code>@</code> syntax, but the currently available set is small. One example is the <code>@IBOutlet</code> attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an ''outlet'', available for use within [[Interface Builder]] (IB). An ''outlet'' is a device that binds the value of the on-screen display to an object in code.\n\nOn non-Apple systems, Swift does not depend on an Objective-C runtime or other Apple system libraries; a set of Swift \"Corelib\" implementations replace them. These include a \"swift-corelibs-foundation\" to stand in for the [[Foundation Kit]], a \"swift-corelibs-libdispatch\" to stand in for the Grand Central Dispatch, and an \"swift-corelibs-xctest\" to stand in for the XCTest APIs from [[XCode]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple: search \"corelib\" |url=https://github.com/apple?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=corelibs&type=&language= |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory management ===\nSwift uses [[Automatic Reference Counting]] (ARC) to [[Memory management|manage memory]]. Apple used to require manual memory management in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 to allow for easier memory allocation and deallocation.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html \"Automatic Reference Counting\"], Apple Inc.</ref> One problem with ARC is the possibility of creating a ''[[Reference counting#reference cycle|strong reference cycle]]'', where objects reference each other in a way that you can reach the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. Swift provides the keywords <code>weak</code> and <code>unowned</code> to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either <code>weak</code> reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or <code>unowned</code> where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become <code>nil</code>.<ref name=\"Intermediate Swift\">{{cite web|last1=Lanier|first1=Brian|last2=Groff|first2=Joe|title=Intermediate Swift|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?include=403#403|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA closure within a class can also create a strong reference cycle by capturing self references. Self references to be treated as weak or unowned can be indicated using a ''capture list.''\n\n=== Debugging and other elements ===\nA key element of the Swift system is its ability to be cleanly debugged and run within the development environment, using a [[read\u2013eval\u2013print loop]] (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional [[system programming]] languages. The REPL is further enhanced with the new concept ''[[Swift Playgrounds|playgrounds]]''. These are interactive views running within the Xcode environment that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Why Coders Are Going Nuts Over Apple's New Programming Language|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/apple-swift-language/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Swift Playgrounds|Playgrounds]] allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, step through and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.\n\nApple says that Swift is \"an industrial-quality programming language that's as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language\".<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ About Swift], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nMany of the features introduced with Swift have well-known performance and safety trade-offs. Apple has implemented [[Optimizing compiler|optimizations]] that reduce this overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/409/ |title=Optimizing Swift Performance |publisher=Apple, Inc. |date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons to other languages ==\n\nSwift is similar to C in various ways:\n\n* Most C operators are used in Swift, but there are some new operators, for example to support integer operations with overflow (see under differences).\n* [[Curly braces]] are used to group statements.\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]]. A new identity operator, ===, is provided to check if two data elements refer to the same [[Pointer (computing)|object]].\n* Control statements <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, and <code>switch</code> are similar, but have extended functions, e.g., a <code>switch</code> that takes non-integer cases, <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> supporting pattern matching and conditionally unwrapping optionals, etc.\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\nIt also has similarities to Objective-C:\n\n* Basic numeric types (<code>Int, UInt, Float, Double</code>)\n* Class methods are inherited, like instance methods; <code>self</code> in class methods is the class the method was called on.\n* Similar <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> enumeration syntax.\n\nDifferences from Objective-C include:\n\n* Statements do not need to end with semicolons (<code>;</code>), though these must be used to allow more than one statement on a line.\n* No header files.\n* Uses [[type inference]].\n* [[Generic programming]].\n* Functions are [[first class function|first-class]] objects.\n* Enumeration cases can have associated data ([[algebraic data type]]s).\n* Operators can be redefined for classes ([[operator overloading]]), and new operators can be defined.\n* Strings fully support [[Unicode]]. Most Unicode characters can be used in either identifiers or operators.\n* No [[exception handling]]. Swift 2 introduces a different and incompatible error-handling model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/26749528|title=Error-Handling in Swift-Language|work=stackoverflow.com}}</ref>\n* Several notoriously error-prone behaviors of earlier [[List of C-family programming languages|C-family languages]] have been changed:\n** [[Pointer (computer programming)|Pointers]] are not exposed by default. There is no need for the programmer to keep track of and mark names for referencing or dereferencing.\n** Assignments return no value. This prevents the common error of writing <code>i = 0</code> instead of <code>i == 0</code> by throwing a compile-time error.\n** No need to use <code>break</code> statements in <code>[[Switch statement|switch]]</code> blocks. Individual cases do not fall through to the next case unless the <code>fallthrough</code> statement is used.\n** Variables and constants are always initialized and array bounds are always checked.\n** [[Integer overflow]]s, which result in [[undefined behavior]] for signed integers in C, are trapped as a run-time error in Swift. Programmers can choose to allow overflows by using the special arithmetical operators <code>&+</code>, <code>&-</code>, <code>&*</code>, <code>&/</code> and <code>&%</code>. The properties <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are defined in Swift for all integer types and can be used to safely check for potential overflows, versus relying on constants defined for each type in external libraries.\n** The one-statement form of <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, which allows for the omission of braces around the statement, is unsupported.\n** C-style enumeration <code>for (int i = 0; i < c; i++)</code>, which is prone to [[off-by-one error]]s, is unsupported (from Swift 3 onward).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0007-remove-c-style-for-loops.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n** The pre- and post- [[increment and decrement operators]] (<code>i++</code>, <code>--i</code> ...) are unsupported (from Swift 3 onward), more so since C-style <code>for</code> statements are also unsupported from Swift 3 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0004-remove-pre-post-inc-decrement.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Development and other implementations ==\nSince the language is open-source, there are prospects of it being ported to the web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/22/ibm-swift-cloud-kitura/|title=IBM brings Swift to the cloud, releases web framework Kitura written in Apple\u2019s programming language|last=Barbosa|first=Greg|date=February 22, 2016|website=9to5Mac|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Some web frameworks have already been developed, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Kitura]], [[Perfect (server framework)|Perfect]] and [[Vapor (Server-side Swift)|Vapor]].\n\nAn official \"Server APIs\" work group has also been started by Apple,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/|title=Server APIs Work Group|last=Inc.|first=Apple|date=October 25, 2016|newspaper=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> with members of the Swift developer community playing a central role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://swift.org/server-apis/|title=Swift.org|last=Inc.|first=Apple|website=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA second free implementation of Swift that targets [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Common Language Infrastructure]] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]]), and the [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform exists as part of the ''Elements Compiler'' from [[RemObjects Software]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = RemObjects Elements Compiler|url = http://www.elementscompiler.com/silver|accessdate = January 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Objective-C]]\n* [[Kotlin (programming language)]]\n* [[Python (programming language)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://developer.apple.com/swift/ Swift] at [[Apple Developer]]\n* {{GitHub|apple/swift|Swift's source code}}\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/swift/ Server-side Swift]\n*[https://iosexample.com/ Swift Example]\n* [https://vapor.codes/ Server-side Swift - The Vapor Framework]\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/products/ibm-toolkit-swift-z-os/ Swift for IBM z/OS]\n* [https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/swift-compiler Swift for Linux on z Systems]\n\n{{Programming languages}}\n{{Apple Software}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Apple Inc. software]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2014]]\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:Pattern matching programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in 2014]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:Statically typed programming languages]]\n[[Category:Systems programming languages]]\n", "name_user": "Gioser1990", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)"}

The gaucho is a national symbol in Argentina and Uruguay, but is also a strong culture in southern Brazil. Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legends, folklore and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers.\n\nThe gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American [[cowboy]] (''[[vaquero]]'' in Spanish), the Chilean ''[[huaso]]'', the Peruvian ''chalan'' or ''[[morochuco]]'', the [[Venezuela]]n or [[Colombia]]n ''[[llanero]]'', the Hawaiian ''[[paniolo]]'',{{sfn|Slatta, Auld and Melrose}} the Mexican ''[[charro]]'' or the Portuguese ''[[campino]]''.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'', in its historical sense a gaucho was \"a [[mestizo]] who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work\".<ref>''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', Tri-Centennial Edition, ''Gaucho'', sense 5.

From ''Picturesque Illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video'' by [[Emeric Essex Vidal]] (1820)]]\n[[File:Argolla.jpg|thumb|250px|Gaucho in ring lancing contest, [[Buenos Aires Province]]]]\nThere are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the term. It may derive from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term {{lang|es|chaucho}}, in turn derived from a Turkish low-rank military term [[Chiaus]] ({{lang|tr|\u00e7avu\u015f}}), through [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar-Latn|shawsh}} which became broadly applied to any guard/watcher or aide.<ref name=\"etymolgy note\">This is rather an implausible origin given that in Spanish loanwords from Arabic, the ''gau'' is often a transformation from the Arabic letter [[waw (letter)|waw]] (W).</ref> The first recorded use of the term dates to [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Argentine independence]] in 1816. Another scenario indicates the word may derive from the Portuguese {{lang|pt|gaud\u00e9rio}}, which was designated to the inhabitants of the vast regions of {{lang|es|[[Rio Grande do Sul]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|es|[[R\u00edo de la Plata]]|italic=no}} in the 18th century or the Portuguese {{lang|pt|garrucho}} that points to an instrument used by the gauchos to trap and hamstring cattle. The 18th century chronicler {{lang|es|[[Alonso Carri\u00f3 de la Vandera]]|italic=no}} speaks of {{lang|es|gauderios}} when it mentions the gauchos or {{lang|es|huasos}} as poorly dressed men.\n\nAnother plausible origin is from a South American indigenous language, such as [[Mapudungun]] {{lang|arn|cauchu}} (\"vagrant\", \"wanderer\"), {{lang|arn|kau\u010du}} (\"friend\"), or [[Quechua language|Quechua]] {{lang|qu|wahcha}} (\"vagabond\", \"poor person\u201d) which means the state of being lonely in the wilderness.\n\n==Horsemanship==\nAn essential attribute of a gaucho was that he was a skilled horseman. \"He has taken his first lessons in riding before he is well able to walk\".{{sfn|Christison|p=39}}   Without a horse the gaucho himself felt unmanned.  The naturalist [[William Henry Hudson]] (who was born on the [[Pampas]] of [[Buenos Aires province]]) recorded that the gauchos of his childhood used to say that a man without a horse was a man without legs.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=23}} He described meeting a blind gaucho who was obliged to beg for his food yet behaved with dignity and went about on horseback.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=24}}  Richard W. Slatta, the author of a scholarly work about gauchos,{{efn|The work has been peer-reviewed by Adelman, 1993; Collier, 1988; Lynch, 1984; Reber, 1984.}} notes that the gaucho used horses to collect, mark, drive or tame cattle, to draw fishing nets, to hunt ostriches, to snare partridges, to draw well water, and even \u2212 with the help of his friends \u2212 to ride to his own burial.{{sfn|Slatta|pp=25-27}}\n\nBy reputation the quintessential gaucho [[caudillo]] [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] could throw his hat on the ground and scoop it up while galloping his horse, without touching the saddle with his hand.{{sfn|Cunninghame Graham, 1914|p=5}} For the gaucho, the horse was absolutely essential to his survival for, said Hudson: \"he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils\".{{sfn|Hudson, 1895|p=356}}\n\nA popular ''[[Copla (meter)|copla]]'' was:\n{{verse translation|lang=es|\nMi caballo y mi mujer\nviajaron para Salta,\nel caballo que se vuelva,\nmi mujer que no me hace falta.{{sfn|Arnoldi and Hern\u00e1ndez|p=177}}\n|\nMy horse and my woman\nWent off to Salta\nMay the horse return\nFor I don't need my woman.\n}}\n\nIt was the gaucho's passion to own all his steeds in matching colours. Hudson recalled: <blockquote>The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla \u2014 his own half a dozen or a dozen or more saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=160}}</blockquote>\n\nThe caudillo El Chacho Pe\u00f1alosa described the low point of his life as \"In Chile \u2212 and on foot!\" (''En Chile y a pie''.){{sfn|Sarmiento|p=14}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Gaucho culture}}\n[[File:Gauchos mateando.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gauchos drinking [[Mate (drink)|mate]] and playing the guitar in the Argentine [[Pampas]]]]\n[[File:Segundo ramirez 1927.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Segundo Ram\u00edrez, who inspired [[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]] to write ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]'']]\nThe gaucho plays an important symbolic role in the nationalist feelings of this region, especially that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The [[epic poem]] ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (writer)|Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez]] (considered by some<ref>[[Leopoldo Lugones]] [http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/l/lugones.htm 1] in \"El Payador\" (1916)[http://www.libroos.es/libros-de-narrativa/fantastica/15225-lugones-leopoldo-el-payador-pdf.html 2] and Ricardo Rojas [http://www.folkloredelnorte.com.ar/creadores/rojas.htm 3] established the canonical view regarding the Mart\u00edn Fierro as the National Epic of Argentina. The consequences of these considerations are discussed by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his essay \"El Mart\u00edn Fierro\". An assessment of the years-long discussion [http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306012640/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf |date=2007-03-06 }}, since p. 18</ref> the [[national epic]] of Argentina) used the gaucho as a symbol against corruption and of Argentine national tradition, pitted against Europeanising tendencies. Mart\u00edn Fierro, the hero of the poem, is drafted into the Argentine military for a border war, deserts, and becomes an outlaw and fugitive. The image of the free gaucho is often contrasted to the slaves who worked the northern Brazilian lands. Further literary descriptions are found in [[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]]' ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]''.\nLike the North American cowboys, as discussed in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were generally reputed to be strong, honest, silent types, but proud and capable of violence when provoked. The gaucho tendency to violence over petty matters is also recognized as a typical trait. Gauchos' use of the famous \"[[fac\u00f3n]]\" (large knife generally tucked into the rear of the gaucho sash) is legendary, often associated with considerable bloodletting. Historically, the fac\u00f3n was typically the only eating instrument that a gaucho carried.\n\nAlso like the cowboy, as shown in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were and remain proud and great horseriders. Typically, a gaucho's [[horse]] constituted most of what he owned in the world. During the wars of the 19th century in the [[Southern Cone]], the [[cavalry|cavalries]] on all sides were composed almost entirely of gauchos. In Argentina, gaucho armies such as that of [[Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes]], slowed Spanish advances. Furthermore, many [[caudillos]] relied on gaucho armies to control the Argentine provinces.\n\nThe gaucho diet was composed almost entirely of beef while on the range, supplemented by ''[[yerba mate]]'' (''[[erva-mate]]'' in Portuguese), an herbal infusion made from the leaves of a South American tree, a type of [[holly]] rich in caffeine and nutrients.\n\nGauchos<ref>[http://www.south-images.com/photos-argentina.htm South-images.com] Photos: gauchos in Argentina, [[Photo library]] South-Images</ref> dressed quite distinctly from North American cowboys, and used ''[[bolas]]'' or ''boleadoras'' - in Portuguese ''boleadeiras'' - (three leather bound rocks tied together with approximately three feet long leather straps) in addition to the familiar \"North American\" [[lasso|lariat]] or riata. The typical gaucho outfit would include a ''[[poncho]]'' (which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear), a ''[[fac\u00f3n]]'' (large knife), a ''[[rebenque]]'' (leather whip), and loose-fitting trousers called ''bombachas'', belted with a ''tirador'', or a ''chirip\u00e1'', a [[loincloth]]. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.\n\nTheir tasks were basically to move the cattle between grazing fields, or to market sites such as the port of Buenos Aires. The ''yerra'' consists of branding the animal with the owner\u2019s sign. The taming of animals was another of their usual activities. Taming was a trade especially appreciated throughout Argentina and competitions to domesticate wild [[foal]] remained in force at festivals. The majority of Gauchos were illiterate and considered as countrymen.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gauchos and Foreigners : Glossing Culture and Identity in the Argentine Countryside |url=https://www-lib-byu-edu.erl.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/remoteauth.pl?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=358456&site=ehost-live&scope=site}}</ref>\n\nGauchos also drank a typical drink called [[Mate (drink)|mate]], traditionally prepared in a hollowed-out [[gourd]] and sipped through a mate metal straw called a bombilla. The water for mate was heated (without boiling) on a stove in a kettle. With mate in hand, Gauchos enjoyed the quiet peace of the countryside with only the birds as company. \n<ref>{{cite web |title=El gaucho en Uruguay y su contribuci\u00f3n a la literatura |url=http://go.galegroup.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CA240796680&docType=Article&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=IFME&contentSet=GALE%7CA240796680&searchId=R1&userGroupName=byuprovo&inPS=true}}</ref>\n\n==Modern influences==\n\n\n''Gauchito'' (a boy in the Argentine colors and a gaucho hat) was the [[FIFA World Cup mascot|mascot]] for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n*''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'' is a 2,316-line epic poem by the Argentine writer Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on the life of the eponymous gaucho.\n*''[[Way of a Gaucho]]'' 1952 film starring [[Gene Tierney]] and [[Rory Calhoun]].\n*''[[The Gaucho]]'' was a 1927 film starring  [[Douglas Fairbanks]].\n*''[[La Guerra Gaucha]]''  was a 1942 Argentine film set during the Gaucho war against Spanish royalists in [[Salta]], northern Argentina, in 1817.

The gaucho is a national symbol in Argentina and Uruguay, but is also a strong culture in southern Brazil. Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legends, folklore and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers.\n\nThe gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American [[cowboy]] (''[[vaquero]]'' in Spanish), the Chilean ''[[huaso]]'', the Peruvian ''chalan'' or ''[[morochuco]]'', the [[Venezuela]]n or [[Colombia]]n ''[[llanero]]'', the Hawaiian ''[[paniolo]]'',{{sfn|Slatta, Auld and Melrose}} the Mexican ''[[charro]]'' or the Portuguese ''[[campino]]''.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'', in its historical sense a gaucho was \"a [[mestizo]] who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work\".<ref>''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', Tri-Centennial Edition, ''Gaucho'', sense 5.

From ''Picturesque Illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video'' by [[Emeric Essex Vidal]] (1820)]]\n[[File:Argolla.jpg|thumb|250px|Gaucho in ring lancing contest, [[Buenos Aires Province]]]]\nThere are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the term. It may derive from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term {{lang|es|chaucho}}, in turn derived from a Turkish low-rank military term [[Chiaus]] ({{lang|tr|\u00e7avu\u015f}}), through [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar-Latn|shawsh}} which became broadly applied to any guard/watcher or aide.<ref name=\"etymolgy note\">This is rather an implausible origin given that in Spanish loanwords from Arabic, the ''gau'' is often a transformation from the Arabic letter [[waw (letter)|waw]] (W).</ref> The first recorded use of the term dates to [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Argentine independence]] in 1816. Another scenario indicates the word may derive from the Portuguese {{lang|pt|gaud\u00e9rio}}, which was designated to the inhabitants of the vast regions of {{lang|es|[[Rio Grande do Sul]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|es|[[R\u00edo de la Plata]]|italic=no}} in the 18th century or the Portuguese {{lang|pt|garrucho}} that points to an instrument used by the gauchos to trap and hamstring cattle. The 18th century chronicler {{lang|es|[[Alonso Carri\u00f3 de la Vandera]]|italic=no}} speaks of {{lang|es|gauderios}} when it mentions the gauchos or {{lang|es|huasos}} as poorly dressed men.\n\nAnother plausible origin is from a South American indigenous language, such as [[Mapudungun]] {{lang|arn|cauchu}} (\"vagrant\", \"wanderer\"), {{lang|arn|kau\u010du}} (\"friend\"), or [[Quechua language|Quechua]] {{lang|qu|wahcha}} (\"vagabond\", \"poor person\u201d) which means the state of being lonely in the wilderness.\n\n==Horsemanship==\nAn essential attribute of a gaucho was that he was a skilled horseman. \"He has taken his first lessons in riding before he is well able to walk\".{{sfn|Christison|p=39}}   Without a horse the gaucho himself felt unmanned.  The naturalist [[William Henry Hudson]] (who was born on the [[Pampas]] of [[Buenos Aires province]]) recorded that the gauchos of his childhood used to say that a man without a horse was a man without legs.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=23}} He described meeting a blind gaucho who was obliged to beg for his food yet behaved with dignity and went about on horseback.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=24}}  Richard W. Slatta, the author of a scholarly work about gauchos,{{efn|The work has been peer-reviewed by Adelman, 1993; Collier, 1988; Lynch, 1984; Reber, 1984.}} notes that the gaucho used horses to collect, mark, drive or tame cattle, to draw fishing nets, to hunt ostriches, to snare partridges, to draw well water, and even \u2212 with the help of his friends \u2212 to ride to his own burial.{{sfn|Slatta|pp=25-27}}\n\nBy reputation the quintessential gaucho [[caudillo]] [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] could throw his hat on the ground and scoop it up while galloping his horse, without touching the saddle with his hand.{{sfn|Cunninghame Graham, 1914|p=5}} For the gaucho, the horse was absolutely essential to his survival for, said Hudson: \"he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils\".{{sfn|Hudson, 1895|p=356}}\n\nA popular ''[[Copla (meter)|copla]]'' was:\n{{verse translation|lang=es|\nMi caballo y mi mujer\nviajaron para Salta,\nel caballo que se vuelva,\nmi mujer que no me hace falta.{{sfn|Arnoldi and Hern\u00e1ndez|p=177}}\n|\nMy horse and my woman\nWent off to Salta\nMay the horse return\nFor I don't need my woman.\n}}\n\nIt was the gaucho's passion to own all his steeds in matching colours. Hudson recalled: <blockquote>The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla \u2014 his own half a dozen or a dozen or more saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=160}}</blockquote>\n\nThe caudillo El Chacho Pe\u00f1alosa described the low point of his life as \"In Chile \u2212 and on foot!\" (''En Chile y a pie''.){{sfn|Sarmiento|p=14}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Gaucho culture}}\n[[File:Gauchos mateando.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gauchos drinking [[Mate (drink)|mate]] and playing the guitar in the Argentine [[Pampas]]]]\n[[File:Segundo ramirez 1927.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Segundo Ram\u00edrez, who inspired [[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]] to write ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]'']]\nThe gaucho plays an important symbolic role in the nationalist feelings of this region, especially that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The [[epic poem]] ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (writer)|Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez]] (considered by some<ref>[[Leopoldo Lugones]] [http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/l/lugones.htm 1] in \"El Payador\" (1916)[http://www.libroos.es/libros-de-narrativa/fantastica/15225-lugones-leopoldo-el-payador-pdf.html 2] and Ricardo Rojas [http://www.folkloredelnorte.com.ar/creadores/rojas.htm 3] established the canonical view regarding the Mart\u00edn Fierro as the National Epic of Argentina. The consequences of these considerations are discussed by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his essay \"El Mart\u00edn Fierro\". An assessment of the years-long discussion [http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306012640/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf |date=2007-03-06 }}, since p. 18</ref> the [[national epic]] of Argentina) used the gaucho as a symbol against corruption and of Argentine national tradition, pitted against Europeanising tendencies. Mart\u00edn Fierro, the hero of the poem, is drafted into the Argentine military for a border war, deserts, and becomes an outlaw and fugitive. The image of the free gaucho is often contrasted to the slaves who worked the northern Brazilian lands. Further literary descriptions are found in [[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]]' ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]''.\nLike the North American cowboys, as discussed in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were generally reputed to be strong, honest, silent types, but proud and capable of violence when provoked. The gaucho tendency to violence over petty matters is also recognized as a typical trait. Gauchos' use of the famous \"[[fac\u00f3n]]\" (large knife generally tucked into the rear of the gaucho sash) is legendary, often associated with considerable bloodletting. Historically, the fac\u00f3n was typically the only eating instrument that a gaucho carried.\n\nAlso like the cowboy, as shown in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were and remain proud and great horseriders. Typically, a gaucho's [[horse]] constituted most of what he owned in the world. During the wars of the 19th century in the [[Southern Cone]], the [[cavalry|cavalries]] on all sides were composed almost entirely of gauchos. In Argentina, gaucho armies such as that of [[Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes]], slowed Spanish advances. Furthermore, many [[caudillos]] relied on gaucho armies to control the Argentine provinces.\n\nThe gaucho diet was composed almost entirely of beef while on the range, supplemented by ''[[yerba mate]]'' (''[[erva-mate]]'' in Portuguese), an herbal infusion made from the leaves of a South American tree, a type of [[holly]] rich in caffeine and nutrients.\n\nGauchos<ref>[http://www.south-images.com/photos-argentina.htm South-images.com] Photos: gauchos in Argentina, [[Photo library]] South-Images</ref> dressed quite distinctly from North American cowboys, and used ''[[bolas]]'' or ''boleadoras'' - in Portuguese ''boleadeiras'' - (three leather bound rocks tied together with approximately three feet long leather straps) in addition to the familiar \"North American\" [[lasso|lariat]] or riata. The typical gaucho outfit would include a ''[[poncho]]'' (which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear), a ''[[fac\u00f3n]]'' (large knife), a ''[[rebenque]]'' (leather whip), and loose-fitting trousers called ''bombachas'', belted with a ''tirador'', or a ''chirip\u00e1'', a [[loincloth]]. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.\n\nTheir tasks were basically to move the cattle between grazing fields, or to market sites such as the port of Buenos Aires. The ''yerra'' consists of branding the animal with the owner\u2019s sign. The taming of animals was another of their usual activities. Taming was a trade especially appreciated throughout Argentina and competitions to domesticate wild [[foal]] remained in force at festivals. The majority of Gauchos were illiterate and considered as countrymen.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gauchos and Foreigners : Glossing Culture and Identity in the Argentine Countryside |url=https://www-lib-byu-edu.erl.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/remoteauth.pl?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=358456&site=ehost-live&scope=site}}</ref>\n\nGauchos also drank a typical drink called [[Mate (drink)|mate]], traditionally prepared in a hollowed-out [[gourd]] and sipped through a mate metal straw called a bombilla. The water for mate was heated (without boiling) on a stove in a kettle. With mate in hand, Gauchos enjoyed the quiet peace of the countryside with only the birds as company. \n<ref>{{cite web |title=El gaucho en Uruguay y su contribuci\u00f3n a la literatura |url=http://go.galegroup.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CA240796680&docType=Article&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=IFME&contentSet=GALE%7CA240796680&searchId=R1&userGroupName=byuprovo&inPS=true}}</ref>\n\n==Modern influences==\n\n\n''Gauchito'' (a boy in the Argentine colors and a gaucho hat) was the [[FIFA World Cup mascot|mascot]] for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n*''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'' is a 2,316-line epic poem by the Argentine writer Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on the life of the eponymous gaucho.\n*''[[Way of a Gaucho]]'' 1952 film starring [[Gene Tierney]] and [[Rory Calhoun]].\n*''[[The Gaucho]]'' was a 1927 film starring  [[Douglas Fairbanks]].\n*''[[La Guerra Gaucha]]''  was a 1942 Argentine film set during the Gaucho war against Spanish royalists in [[Salta]], northern Argentina, in 1817.

It is specially known for their [[CuBox]] family of mini-computers (said to be the world's smallest desktop computer at the time of its launch), and for producing [[motherboard]]s and processing components such as the HummingBoard motherboard.\n\nSituated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] Industrial Park, SolidRun develops and manufactures products aimed both for the private entertainment sector, and for companies developing [[Computer processor|processor]] based products, notably components of \"[[Internet of Things]]\" technology systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company page|url=https://www.solid-run.com/about-solidrun/|website=SolidRun|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWithin the scope of the IoT technology, SolidRun's mini computers are aimed to cover the intermediate sphere, between sensors and user devices, and between the larger network or Cloud framework. Within such a network, mini computers or [[System on module|system-on-module]] devices, act as mediators gathering and processing information from sensors or user devices and communicating with the network - this is also known as [[Edge computing]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:SolidRun-soms.jpg|280px|thumbnail|Three of SolidRun's MicroSOMs from the i.MX6, Intel Braswell & Marvell ARMADA product families.]]\nSolidRun was founded in 2010 by co-founders [[Rabeeh Khoury]] (formally an engineer at [[Marvell Technology Group]]) and [[Kossay Omary]], today chairman and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] respectively. The goal of SolidRun has been to develop, produce and market components aimed for integration with IoT systems.\n\nThe company today is situated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] [[HiTech]] Industrial Park in the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of Israel, and headed by Dr. Atai Ziv (CEO).\n\nThe major product development line aimed at the consumer market is the CuBox family of mini-computers. The first of which was announced in December 2011, followed by the development of the CuBox-i series, announced in November 2013. The most recent addition to the CuBox line has been the CuBoxTV (announced in December 2014), which has been marketed primarily for the [[home video|home entertainment]] market. A further primary product developed by SolidRun is the Hummingboard, an uncased single-board computer, marketed to developers as an integrated processing component.\n\nSolidRun develops all of its products using [[Open-source software]] (such as [[Linux]] and [[OpenELEC]]), identifying itself as a member of the OSS community and a promoter of Open-source software platforms.\n\nThe products developed by SolidRun are classed into three families, based upon the processor maker. Each family offers roughly the same range of mini-computers, SOM's & COM's - currently divided into [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] iMX-6, [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]] Armada & [[Intel]] [[Braswell (SOC)|Braswell]] families. Every processing family offering different advantages with different application capacities.\n\n==NXP i.MX6 family products==\n[[File:Cubox.png|250px|thumbnail|A CuBox-i [[quad-core]] variant housing a [[Freescale]] [[I.MX]]6 [[Microprocessor]].]]\n[[File:Hummingboard-i2eX-Top.png|250px|thumbnail|The HummingBoard i.MX6-based computer-on-module.]]\n\n===CuBox-i & CuBoxTV===\n{{see also|CuBox}}\nAnnounced in December 2011, CuBox and CuBox-i are a series of fanless [[nettop]]-class mini computers, all cube shaped and approximate 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 inches in size, weighing around 91&nbsp;g (3.2&nbsp;oz).<ref>http://www.cnx-software.com/2013/09/05/solidrun-announces-cubox-i-platform-with-freescale-i-mx6-for-as-low-as-45/ SolidRun Announces Cubox-i Platform with Freescale i.MX6 for as low as $ 45</ref>\n\nCuBox is a low-power [[ARM architecture]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] based computer, using the Marvell Armada 510 (88AP510) SoC with an ARM v6/v7-compliant superscalar processor core, [[Vivante]] GC600 [[OpenGL]] 3.0 and [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 capable 2D/3D [[graphics processing unit]], Marvell vMeta HD Video Decoder hardware engine, and [[ARM architecture#Security extensions (TrustZone)|TrustZone]] security extensions, Cryptographic Engines and Security Accelerator (CESA) co-processor.\n\nIn November 2013, SolidRun released a family of CuBox-i computers named CuBox-i1, i2, i2eX, and i4Pro, containing a range of different [[I.MX#i.MX6x series|i.MX6]] processors by [[Freescale Semiconductor]].<ref name=cubox-i-hardware>{{cite web |url=http://www.solid-run.com/products/cubox-i-mini-computer/cubox-i-specifications/ |title=CuBox-i specifications |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in December 2014, '''CuBoxTV''' is a mid-range CuBox-i [[Computer-on-module|SOM]] device for running [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]] on an [[OpenELEC]] [[Operating system]], developed for the home entertainment market.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Honorof|first1=Marshall|title=CuBox is a Tiny XBMC Set-Top Box in a 2-inch Cube|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/cubox-tv-xbmc-tiny,news-19960.html|website=Tom's Guide|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nCuBoxTV is based on an [[ARM architecture]] [[Quad core]] [[CPU]], 1 GB, 64 bit memory, GC2000 [[GPU]] with an [[OpenGL]] ES quad shader, and a host of video, audio and picture decoders and encoders supporting all major file type.

It is specially known for their [[CuBox]] family of mini-computers (said to be the world's smallest desktop computer at the time of its launch), and for producing [[motherboard]]s and processing components such as the HummingBoard motherboard.\n\nSituated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] Industrial Park, SolidRun develops and manufactures products aimed both for the private entertainment sector, and for companies developing [[Computer processor|processor]] based products, notably components of \"[[Internet of Things]]\" technology systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company page|url=https://www.solid-run.com/about-solidrun/|website=SolidRun|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWithin the scope of the IoT technology, SolidRun's mini computers are aimed to cover the intermediate sphere, between sensors and user devices, and between the larger network or Cloud framework. Within such a network, mini computers or [[System on module|system-on-module]] devices, act as mediators gathering and processing information from sensors or user devices and communicating with the network - this is also known as [[Edge computing]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:SolidRun-soms.jpg|280px|thumbnail|Three of SolidRun's MicroSOMs from the i.MX6, Intel Braswell & Marvell ARMADA product families.]]\nSolidRun was founded in 2010 by co-founders [[Rabeeh Khoury]] (formally an engineer at [[Marvell Technology Group]]) and [[Kossay Omary]], today chairman and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] respectively. The goal of SolidRun has been to develop, produce and market components aimed for integration with IoT systems.\n\nThe company today is situated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] [[HiTech]] Industrial Park in the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of Israel, and headed by Dr. Atai Ziv (CEO).\n\nThe major product development line aimed at the consumer market is the CuBox family of mini-computers. The first of which was announced in December 2011, followed by the development of the CuBox-i series, announced in November 2013. The most recent addition to the CuBox line has been the CuBoxTV (announced in December 2014), which has been marketed primarily for the [[home video|home entertainment]] market. A further primary product developed by SolidRun is the Hummingboard, an uncased single-board computer, marketed to developers as an integrated processing component.\n\nSolidRun develops all of its products using [[Open-source software]] (such as [[Linux]] and [[OpenELEC]]), identifying itself as a member of the OSS community and a promoter of Open-source software platforms.\n\nThe products developed by SolidRun are classed into three families, based upon the processor maker. Each family offers roughly the same range of mini-computers, SOM's & COM's - currently divided into [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] iMX-6, [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]] Armada & [[Intel]] [[Braswell (SOC)|Braswell]] families. Every processing family offering different advantages with different application capacities.\n\n==NXP i.MX6 family products==\n[[File:Cubox.png|250px|thumbnail|A CuBox-i [[quad-core]] variant housing a [[Freescale]] [[I.MX]]6 [[Microprocessor]].]]\n[[File:Hummingboard-i2eX-Top.png|250px|thumbnail|The HummingBoard i.MX6-based computer-on-module.]]\n\n===CuBox-i & CuBoxTV===\n{{see also|CuBox}}\nAnnounced in December 2011, CuBox and CuBox-i are a series of fanless [[nettop]]-class mini computers, all cube shaped and approximate 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 inches in size, weighing around 91&nbsp;g (3.2&nbsp;oz).<ref>http://www.cnx-software.com/2013/09/05/solidrun-announces-cubox-i-platform-with-freescale-i-mx6-for-as-low-as-45/ SolidRun Announces Cubox-i Platform with Freescale i.MX6 for as low as $ 45</ref>\n\nCuBox is a low-power [[ARM architecture]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] based computer, using the Marvell Armada 510 (88AP510) SoC with an ARM v6/v7-compliant superscalar processor core, [[Vivante]] GC600 [[OpenGL]] 3.0 and [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 capable 2D/3D [[graphics processing unit]], Marvell vMeta HD Video Decoder hardware engine, and [[ARM architecture#Security extensions (TrustZone)|TrustZone]] security extensions, Cryptographic Engines and Security Accelerator (CESA) co-processor.\n\nIn November 2013, SolidRun released a family of CuBox-i computers named CuBox-i1, i2, i2eX, and i4Pro, containing a range of different [[I.MX#i.MX6x series|i.MX6]] processors by [[Freescale Semiconductor]].<ref name=cubox-i-hardware>{{cite web |url=http://www.solid-run.com/products/cubox-i-mini-computer/cubox-i-specifications/ |title=CuBox-i specifications |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in December 2014, '''CuBoxTV''' is a mid-range CuBox-i [[Computer-on-module|SOM]] device for running [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]] on an [[OpenELEC]] [[Operating system]], developed for the home entertainment market.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Honorof|first1=Marshall|title=CuBox is a Tiny XBMC Set-Top Box in a 2-inch Cube|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/cubox-tv-xbmc-tiny,news-19960.html|website=Tom's Guide|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nCuBoxTV is based on an [[ARM architecture]] [[Quad core]] [[CPU]], 1 GB, 64 bit memory, GC2000 [[GPU]] with an [[OpenGL]] ES quad shader, and a host of video, audio and picture decoders and encoders supporting all major file type.

His Ethiopian compatriot Kenenisa Bekele matched his feat of four consecutive titles in 2009. [[Tirunesh Dibaba]] is the most successful woman, with three gold medals to her name (2005, 2007, 2013, plus a silver in 2017).\n\n[[Ethiopia at the World Championships in Athletics|Ethiopia]] is by far the most successful nation in the discipline, with fifteen gold medals and 33 medals in total. [[Kenya at the World Championships in Athletics|Kenya]] is comfortably the next most successful with seven gold and 25 medals overall.

Of these, only [[Mo Farah]] has achieved the feat twice, in 2013 and 2015 - either side of which he performed the same feat in consecutive Olympic Games.\n\n==Age==\nAt 15 years, 153 days, [[Sally Barsosio]] won the bronze medal in the women's 10,000&nbsp;m at the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics]].
