{"title_page": "Demogroup", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=August 2014}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n}}\n{{Demoscene}}\n'''Demogroups''' are teams of '''demosceners''', who make computer based audio-visual works of art known as [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]]. Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the [[demoscene]].\n\nGroups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a [[pseudonym]] (called a \"[[screen name (computing)|handle]]\" or \"[[nickname|nick]]\"), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like \"Scener of Demo Group\" or \"Scener/DG\"). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.\n\nMany demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via [[Bulletin Board System]]s or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at [[demoparty|demoparties]] and smaller meetings.\n\nDemogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate [[wordmark]]s, [[logo]]s, [[catchphrase]]s, and [[slogan]]s for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for \"managing the group's human resources\", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying \"trial periods\" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often [[tongue-in-cheek]]), to maintain an \"elite\" image for the group.\n\nA group is perhaps the most important [[social unit]] in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several \"one-man groups\" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.\n\n==Demography==\nThe countries with the most active demogroups and [[demoparty|demoparties]] are currently the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Denmark]]), [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]] and [[France]].\n\nDue to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon.\n\n==Demoscener functions==\nDemosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder-musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend.\n\n===Coder===\nThe coder is the demogroup's programmer who creates the demo's software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo.

Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the [[demoscene]].\n\nGroups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a [[pseudonym]] (called a \"[[screen name (computing)|handle]]\" or \"[[nickname|nick]]\"), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like \"Scener of Demo Group\" or \"Scener/DG\"). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.\n\nMany demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via [[Bulletin Board System]]s or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at [[demoparty|demoparties]] and smaller meetings.\n\nDemogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate [[wordmark]]s, [[logo]]s, [[catchphrase]]s, and [[slogan]]s for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for \"managing the group's human resources\", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying \"trial periods\" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often [[tongue-in-cheek]]), to maintain an \"elite\" image for the group.\n\nA group is perhaps the most important [[social unit]] in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several \"one-man groups\" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.\n\n==Demography==\nThe countries with the most active demogroups and [[demoparty|demoparties]] are currently the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]]), [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]] and [[France]].\n\nDue to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon.\n\n==Demoscener functions==\nDemosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder-musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend.\n\n===Coder===\nThe coder is the demogroup's programmer who creates the demo's software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and [[application programming interface|API]]s for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as [[fractal]]s or [[metaballs]].\n\nIn the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo's flow and arrangement, including the effect's synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as ''demotools'' are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.\n\nIn many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with \"coder music\" which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. \"Coder graphics\" and \"coder palettes\" are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.\n\n===Graphic artist===\nGraphic artists (or ''graphicians'' in scene [[Jargon|lingo]]) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation.\n\nOriginally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel).

In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional [[music sequencer]]s.

It was created in 1979, and has about 6,879 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all [[academic degree]]s in fields ranging from [[medicine]] and [[biomedical sciences]] to [[aeronautical engineering]] to [[mathematics]]. The university is named after the historical [[Beira, Portugal|Beira region]], meaning ''Beira Interior'' the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the [[Guarda (district)|district of Guarda]] and the [[Castelo Branco (district)|district of Castelo Branco]], in today's [[Centro region]].\n\n== History ==\nIn August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]]al institution in Covilh\u00e3, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilh\u00e3 (''IPC - Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico da Covilh\u00e3''), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, [[university institute]]. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full [[university]] status and renamed University of Beira Interior (''Universidade da Beira Interior'').\n\n== Organisation ==\nFor [[teaching]] and [[research]] purposes, UBI is organised into five [[Faculty (division)|Faculties]]. The Faculties are organised in Departments:\n\n*The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics; Physics; and Chemistry.\n*The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the Departments of Textile Science and Technology; Paper Science and Technology; Electromechanical Engineering; Civil Engineering; and Aerospace Sciences.\n*The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics; Department of Sociology; Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences.\n*The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters\n*The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences.\n\nAll departments of the university grant the undergraduate ''licenciado'' degree ([[licentiate's degree]] or [[bachelor's degree]]), which requires a three-year full-time study programme. UBI also awards postgraduate courses in the fields that are offered by its departments, granting the degrees of ''mestre'' ([[master's degree]]) and ''doutor'' ([[Ph.D.]]).\n\nIn order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development.\n\nThe [[Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira]] (Cova da Beira Hospital Center), with facilities in [[Covilh\u00e3]] and [[Fund\u00e3o, Portugal|Fund\u00e3o]], is the [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Beira Interior. Hospitals of [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] and [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]] also collaborate with the Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n|

lecturers.\n\nStudents coming from other [[European Union]] member-states and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] (''{{lang|pt|Pa\u00edses Africanos de L\u00edngua Oficial Portuguesa}}'') countries accounts for nearly 200. [http://palop.ubi.pt/ '''+ info''']\n\n== Teaching and learning methods ==\nAll courses are taught in [[Portuguese language]], and the teaching process is undertaken using a mixture of theoretical and practical processes. Theoretical lessons are usually supported by:\n\n* Theoretical/Practical lessons where the students guided by the teacher have the chance to discuss and resolve problems.\n* Practical lessons, where the students are challenged to solve practical problems in laboratories, ateliers or computer facilities and able to apply the theoretical knowledge that they already understood and learned.\n\n== Academic year ==\nThe Academic year at UBI consists of two semesters. The first (Autumn and Winter semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid September to mid February and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. The second (Spring and Summer semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid February to mid July and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. [[Christmas]] time holidays has two weeks. And [[Easter]] time holidays has one week.\n\n== University campus ==\n[[Image:UBI - Biblioteca principal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The main library of the University of Beira Interior]]\n[[Image:UBI - Polo Principal 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|P\u00f3lo I main buildings]]\n[[Image:UBI Auditorio ar livre medicina.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The outside auditorium of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Beira Interior (P\u00f3lo III)]]\nOver the years, the UBI had a remarkable evolution and nowadays it is a modern university full of well-equipped laboratories, ateliers, libraries, computer rooms, research centres, and offering a wide range of activities through the [[students' union]] (''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica da Universidade da Beira Interior'') and university social services.\n\nThe university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilh\u00e3 industrial roots. The city was an important textile centre, once known as the \"Portuguese Manchester\". Over the last decades the city witnessed a restructuring of this industry. However, many factories were not able to meet the requirements of the global market and had to close down. Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, are started the 21st century serving the noble purpose of educating the Portuguese society.\n\nOver 250,000 m2 of buildings are dedicated to academic activities and social services. The university campus is divided into several spaces, called ''P\u00f3los'', which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution.\n\nThe synopsis below provides information about the ''P\u00f3los'' of UBI and its libraries:\n*'''P\u00f3lo I''' - The main building is a 17th-century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices. New buildings near have been erected over the years to keep up the continuous growth of the UBI. Due to a diligent renovation work this set of buildings are considered historical, cultural and architectonical outstanding pieces of [[industrial archaeology]]. Among this sector the following units are located: the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, the Wool Museum, the Computer Centre, the Optics Centre, the S\u00e3o Martinho Chapel, the Main Library, the Bank, the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (Multimedia Centre) and the Centre For Heritage Studies and Recovery.\n*'''P\u00f3lo II''' - On a hill, less than 1&nbsp;km from P\u00f3lo I, and meeting the UBI need for constant expansion, an area was created where several central infrastructures, as the emblematic 16th century convent that nowadays houses the [[Rectory]], the administration services and the international relations office. In the same area are also located the academic residences, Santo Antonio cafeteria, the sport halls, the social affairs centre and the centre of studies for regional development. The Department of Sports and Science is also located nearby.\n*'''P\u00f3lo III''' - This is where the Faculty of Health Sciences is located. It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the [[Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira|Central Hospital]] in a distance of 1&nbsp;km far from P\u00f3lo I.\n*'''P\u00f3lo IV''' - This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university. It houses the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, the Cyber Centre [http://www.cybercentro-covilha.pt/] and a residence hall with Snack Bar.\n*'''Libraries''' - UBI has three libraries. The Main Library is located in P\u00f3lo I following the aim of meeting the students' needs. All libraries of UBI have an information desk where one can obtain information and help. Once the Library Card is issued, students can use it to borrow books from any library. The Main Library offers a wide range of services spread among 3 different floors. Textbooks and course materials, scientific publications, bibliographies and reference works in all subjects taught at the University are available. Among other services, students can use the individual study and reading rooms, Inter-Library loan service, photocopy services, scanners, CD-ROM, Videos, DVD or consult the Library Database and Internet (200 computers).\n\n== UBI residence halls ==\nThe UBI maintains 7 residence halls. One of the residence halls is located in ''P\u00f3lo II'', 5 minutes of walking distance from the university's main buildings (''P\u00f3lo I'') and the other (''Resid\u00eancia Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral'') is located near the ''P\u00f3lo IV''. All the rooms are equipped with closets, desks, chairs, beds and central heating. One or two students are assigned to each room. The Students' Social Affairs Centre manages all the university housing offers.\n\n== Students' union ==\nThe students' union, ''AAUBI - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica da Universidade da Beira Interior'' [http://www.aaubi.ubi.pt/], is headquartered within the old part of the town, near Santa Maria church. The union also has its office in ''P\u00f3lo I'', two floors upstairs from the bank.\n\nThe students' union (AAUBI) offers a wide range of activities concerning sports, culture and leisure. During the whole year there are many indoor events such like chess meetings or activities in sports halls as climbing, volleyball, basketball, football, badminton and table tennis.\n\nA freshmen reception week, organised by the students's union of the University of Beira Interior, takes place in November and includes a parade through town (the ''[[Latada]]'') and several concerts.\n\n== Online radio, television and journal ==\nThe university has an online radio  - ''R\u00e1dio Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior'' [http://www.rubi.ubi.pt/], an online television - ''Televis\u00e3o Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior'' [http://www.tubi.ubi.pt/], and an online journal - ''Urbi et Orbi'' [http://www.urbi.ubi.pt/].\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe University of Beira Interior has two indoor sports pavilions, among other sports facilities. Competitive varsity sports teams of UBI include [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[futsal]], [[team handball|handball]], [[rugby union]] and [[volleyball]].\n\n== Wool museum ==\n[[Image:UBI - Rua principal e museu.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Wool museum entrance, to the right, which is delimited by two pedestrian bridges that connect two of the UBI's buildings]]\nThe UBI adapted the buildings of the former ''Real F\u00e1brica de Panos'' (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by [[Marqu\u00eas de Pombal]] in 1764. This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the Regimento de Infantaria 21 (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the Batalh\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7adores 2 (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion).\n\nIn 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye-house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum's educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century.[http://museu.ubi.pt/ind_ingles.html]\n\nGuided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday from 9:30h to midday and from 14:30h to 18h.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of universities in Portugal]]\n*[[Higher education in Portugal]]\n* [[Air Cargo Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Universidade da Beira Interior}}\n*[https://www.ubi.pt/en/ University of Beira Interior]\n*[https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=40.277381,-7.508866&spn=0.001846,0.003648&t=k&om=1 UBI (P\u00f3lo I) viewed from satellite]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Covilha-Portugal/UBI-Universidade-da-Beira-Interior/143419211198 UBI on Facebook]\n*[https://twitter.com/UBI_RP UBI on Twitter]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/UBI_RP UBI on Instagram]\n*[https://www.google.com/profiles/Universidade.da.Beira.Interior UBI on Buzz]\n*{{YouTube|UniverBeiraInterior|title=UBI}}\n*[http://www.depardizayn.com ic mimarlik]\n\n{{Public universities in Portugal}}\n\n{{coord|40.27738|N|7.50887|W|type:landmark_source:enwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:University Of Beira Interior}}\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Universities in Portugal|Beira]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Castelo Branco District]]\n[[Category:Covilh\u00e3]]\n", "text_old": "{{More references|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox university\n|name          =University of Beira Interior\n|native_name   =Universidade da Beira Interior\n|latin_name    =\n|motto         = ''Scientia et Labore Altiora Petimus'' ([[Latin]])\n|image         = Ubi.jpg\n|image_upright = 0.7\n|established   =1979\n|type          =[[Public University]]\n|rector        =Ant\u00f3nio Carreto Fidalgo\n|students      = 6,879\n|staff         = 693 (professors)\n|city          =[[Covilh\u00e3]] \n|country       =[[Portugal]] \n|campus        = [[Urban area|Urban]]\n|colours       = {{color box|#00246b}} [[Blue]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubi.pt/Ficheiros/Menus/1/UBI_iD_KitNormas_Base_web.pdf|title=Guia de Normas de Identidade - Kit Base |publisher=UBI website |accessdate=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n|affiliations  = \n|website       ={{URL|1=http://www.ubi.pt/en/|2=www.ubi.pt}}\n}}\n\nThe '''University of Beira Interior''' ('''UBI'''; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Universidade da Beira Interior'') is a [[public university]] located in the city of [[Covilh\u00e3]], Portugal. It was created in 1979, and has about 6,879 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all [[academic degree]]s in fields ranging from [[medicine]] and [[biomedical sciences]] to [[aeronautical engineering]] to [[mathematics]]. The university is named after the historical [[Beira, Portugal|Beira region]], meaning ''Beira Interior'' the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the [[Guarda (district)|district of Guarda]] and the [[Castelo Branco (district)|district of Castelo Branco]], in today's [[Centro region]].\n\n== History ==\nIn August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]]al institution in Covilh\u00e3, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilh\u00e3 (''IPC - Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico da Covilh\u00e3''), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, [[university institute]]. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full [[university]] status and renamed University of Beira Interior (''Universidade da Beira Interior'').\n\n== Organisation ==\nFor [[teaching]] and [[research]] purposes, UBI is organised into five [[Faculty (division)|Faculties]]. The Faculties are organised in Departments:\n\n*The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics; Physics; and Chemistry.\n*The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the Departments of Textile Science and Technology; Paper Science and Technology; Electromechanical Engineering; Civil Engineering; and Aerospace Sciences.\n*The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics; Department of Sociology; Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences.\n*The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters\n*The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences.\n\nAll departments of the university grant the undergraduate ''licenciado'' degree ([[licentiate's degree]] or [[bachelor's degree]]), which requires a three-year full-time study programme. UBI also awards postgraduate courses in the fields that are offered by its departments, granting the degrees of ''mestre'' ([[master's degree]]) and ''doutor'' ([[Ph.D.]]).\n\nIn order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development.\n\nThe [[Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira]] (Cova da Beira Hospital Center), with facilities in [[Covilh\u00e3]] and [[Fund\u00e3o, Portugal|Fund\u00e3o]], is the [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Beira Interior. Hospitals of [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] and [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]] also collaborate with the Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n|

lecturers.\n\nStudents coming from other [[European Union]] member-states and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] (''{{lang|pt|Pa\u00edses Africanos de L\u00edngua Oficial Portuguesa}}'') countries accounts for nearly 200. [http://palop.ubi.pt/ '''+ info''']\n\n== Teaching and learning methods ==\nAll courses are taught in [[Portuguese language]], and the teaching process is undertaken using a mixture of theoretical and practical processes. Theoretical lessons are usually supported by:\n\n* Theoretical/Practical lessons where the students guided by the teacher have the chance to discuss and resolve problems.\n* Practical lessons, where the students are challenged to solve practical problems in laboratories, ateliers or computer facilities and able to apply the theoretical knowledge that they already understood and learned.\n\n== Academic year ==\nThe Academic year at UBI consists of two semesters. The first (Autumn and Winter semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid September to mid February and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. The second (Spring and Summer semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid February to mid July and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. [[Christmas]] time holidays has two weeks. And [[Easter]] time holidays has one week.\n\n== University campus ==\n[[Image:UBI - Biblioteca principal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The main library of the University of Beira Interior]]\n[[Image:UBI - Polo Principal 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|P\u00f3lo I main buildings]]\n[[Image:UBI Auditorio ar livre medicina.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The outside auditorium of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Beira Interior (P\u00f3lo III)]]\nOver the years, the UBI had a remarkable evolution and nowadays it is a modern university full of well-equipped laboratories, ateliers, libraries, computer rooms, research centres, and offering a wide range of activities through the [[students' union]] (''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica da Universidade da Beira Interior'') and university social services.\n\nThe university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilh\u00e3 industrial roots. The city was an important textile centre, once known as the \"Portuguese Manchester\". Over the last decades the city witnessed a restructuring of this industry. However, many factories were not able to meet the requirements of the global market and had to close down. Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, are started the 21st century serving the noble purpose of educating the Portuguese society.\n\nOver 250,000 m2 of buildings are dedicated to academic activities and social services. The university campus is divided into several spaces, called ''P\u00f3los'', which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution.\n\nThe synopsis below provides information about the ''P\u00f3los'' of UBI and its libraries:\n*'''P\u00f3lo I''' - The main building is a 17th-century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices. New buildings near have been erected over the years to keep up the continuous growth of the UBI. Due to a diligent renovation work this set of buildings are considered historical, cultural and architectonical outstanding pieces of [[industrial archaeology]]. Among this sector the following units are located: the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, the Wool Museum, the Computer Centre, the Optics Centre, the S\u00e3o Martinho Chapel, the Main Library, the Bank, the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (Multimedia Centre) and the Centre For Heritage Studies and Recovery.\n*'''P\u00f3lo II''' - On a hill, less than 1&nbsp;km from P\u00f3lo I, and meeting the UBI need for constant expansion, an area was created where several central infrastructures, as the emblematic 16th century convent that nowadays houses the [[Rectory]], the administration services and the international relations office. In the same area are also located the academic residences, Santo Antonio cafeteria, the sport halls, the social affairs centre and the centre of studies for regional development. The Department of Sports and Science is also located nearby.\n*'''P\u00f3lo III''' - This is where the Faculty of Health Sciences is located. It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the [[Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira|Central Hospital]] in a distance of 1&nbsp;km far from P\u00f3lo I.\n*'''P\u00f3lo IV''' - This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university. It houses the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, the Cyber Centre [http://www.cybercentro-covilha.pt/] and a residence hall with Snack Bar.\n*'''Libraries''' - UBI has three libraries. The Main Library is located in P\u00f3lo I following the aim of meeting the students' needs. All libraries of UBI have an information desk where one can obtain information and help. Once the Library Card is issued, students can use it to borrow books from any library. The Main Library offers a wide range of services spread among 3 different floors. Textbooks and course materials, scientific publications, bibliographies and reference works in all subjects taught at the University are available. Among other services, students can use the individual study and reading rooms, Inter-Library loan service, photocopy services, scanners, CD-ROM, Videos, DVD or consult the Library Database and Internet (200 computers).\n\n== UBI residence halls ==\nThe UBI maintains 7 residence halls. One of the residence halls is located in ''P\u00f3lo II'', 5 minutes of walking distance from the university's main buildings (''P\u00f3lo I'') and the other (''Resid\u00eancia Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral'') is located near the ''P\u00f3lo IV''. All the rooms are equipped with closets, desks, chairs, beds and central heating. One or two students are assigned to each room. The Students' Social Affairs Centre manages all the university housing offers.\n\n== Students' union ==\nThe students' union, ''AAUBI - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica da Universidade da Beira Interior'' [http://www.aaubi.ubi.pt/], is headquartered within the old part of the town, near Santa Maria church. The union also has its office in ''P\u00f3lo I'', two floors upstairs from the bank.\n\nThe students' union (AAUBI) offers a wide range of activities concerning sports, culture and leisure. During the whole year there are many indoor events such like chess meetings or activities in sports halls as climbing, volleyball, basketball, football, badminton and table tennis.\n\nA freshmen reception week, organised by the students's union of the University of Beira Interior, takes place in November and includes a parade through town (the ''[[Latada]]'') and several concerts.\n\n== Online radio, television and journal ==\nThe university has an online radio  - ''R\u00e1dio Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior'' [http://www.rubi.ubi.pt/], an online television - ''Televis\u00e3o Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior'' [http://www.tubi.ubi.pt/], and an online journal - ''Urbi et Orbi'' [http://www.urbi.ubi.pt/].\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe University of Beira Interior has two indoor sports pavilions, among other sports facilities. Competitive varsity sports teams of UBI include [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[futsal]], [[team handball|handball]], [[rugby union]] and [[volleyball]].\n\n== Wool museum ==\n[[Image:UBI - Rua principal e museu.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Wool museum entrance, to the right, which is delimited by two pedestrian bridges that connect two of the UBI's buildings]]\nThe UBI adapted the buildings of the former ''Real F\u00e1brica de Panos'' (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by [[Marqu\u00eas de Pombal]] in 1764. This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the Regimento de Infantaria 21 (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the Batalh\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7adores 2 (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion).\n\nIn 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye-house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum's educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century.[http://museu.ubi.pt/ind_ingles.html]\n\nGuided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday from 9:30h to midday and from 14:30h to 18h.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of universities in Portugal]]\n*[[Higher education in Portugal]]\n* [[Air Cargo Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Universidade da Beira Interior}}\n*[https://www.ubi.pt/en/ University of Beira Interior]\n*[https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=40.277381,-7.508866&spn=0.001846,0.003648&t=k&om=1 UBI (P\u00f3lo I) viewed from satellite]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Covilha-Portugal/UBI-Universidade-da-Beira-Interior/143419211198 UBI on Facebook]\n*[https://twitter.com/UBI_RP UBI on Twitter]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/UBI_RP UBI on Instagram]\n*[https://www.google.com/profiles/Universidade.da.Beira.Interior UBI on Buzz]\n*{{YouTube|UniverBeiraInterior|title=UBI}}\n*[http://www.depardizayn.com ic mimarlik]\n\n{{Public universities in Portugal}}\n\n{{coord|40.27738|N|7.50887|W|type:landmark_source:enwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:University Of Beira Interior}}\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Universities in Portugal|Beira]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Castelo Branco District]]\n[[Category:Covilh\u00e3]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Beira_Interior"}

Son of Sri Raoji Gopal Chitnis.\n\n==Military career==\nLt Col Chitnis got commissioned into the Third Battalion of the [[Gorkha Rifles]] on 12 Apr 1942. After passing out from OTS Bangalore, Lt Col Chitnis served with his unit in different operational areas and evolved into an experienced and battle-hardened soldier.\n\nBy 1956, Lt Col Chitnis had put in about 14 years of service and had been promoted to the rank of a Lt Col. In 1956, he had become commanding officer of 1/3 [[Gorkha Rifles]] and was serving in the northeastern border of the country. Lt Col Chitnis was a committed soldier and a fine officer,  who commanded the respect of his men. As a thorough professional, Lt Col Chitnis had trained and established his battalion into a lethal strike force.\n\n==Naga Hills attack==\nDuring 1956, Lt Col Jagannath Raoji Chitnis was posted in [[Nagaland]] as Commanding Officer of 1/3 Gorkha Rifles. On 14th June, 1956, Lt Col Chitnis accompanied by [[Subedar Major]] Nain Singh was heading towards Zunhebeto from Mokokchung with a treasury chest containing the pay of the battalion. There was a convoy of eight jeeps with a platoon as escort. On nearing the 21st km milestone, around 100 Naga rebels belonging to Gen Kaito Sema\u2019s Federal Army opened fire on the middle jeep of the convoy. These rebels were heavily armed with LMGs (Light Machine Guns), sten guns and rifles. The sudden attack resulted in three of the jeeps getting isolated.\n\nLt Col Chitnis quickly assessed the situation and halted the other five jeeps. He along with four of his soldiers had already sustained injuries in the ensuing gunfire. After quickly assembling his troops, he arranged for covering the incessant firing. Leading from the front and backed by his [[platoon]], he began moving towards the militants\u2019 position amidst ongoing gunfire. About 150 yards short of the rebels\u2019 bunkers, Lt Col Chitnis ordered a counter-attack despite being wounded in the leg. He forged ahead undeterred and attacked the rebels with a bayonet, killing one and injuring another. Thereafter when an LMG opened fire on his party from a flank, he again led a bayonet charge against the LMG post and got critically injured in the stomach. As a consequence of his grave injuries, he fell 15 yards from the rebel bunker but that didn\u2019t diminish his zeal as he continued to motivate and guide his platoon to destroy the rebel position. Lt Col Chitnis was martyred, but his troops motivated by the inspirational leadership of their commanding officer finally managed to destroy the rebel camp and killed 20 rebels.\n\n==Ashoka chakra awardee==\nLt Col Jagannath Raoji Chitnis, on account of his extraordinary courage, exemplary leadership and unparalleled devotion to duty was awarded India\u2019s highest gallantry peacetime award, \u201c [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashok Chakra]]\u201d.\u00a0Lt Col J S Chitnis is survived by his son Captain Nandu Chitnis, Master Mariner with the [[Shipping Corporation of India]].\n\n== Reference ==\n<references />\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = [[Lieutenant Colonel]]\n| name          = Jagannath Raoji Chitnis\n| honorific_suffix = [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]]\n| image         = \n| image_size    = \n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{birth date |1918|08|20}}\n| death_date    = {{death date and age |1956|06|14|1918|08|20}}\n| birth_place   = [[Satara]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]\n| death_place   = [[Nagaland]], [[India]]\n| allegiance    = {{Flag|India}}\n| branch        = {{Army|India}}\n| serviceyears  = 1942-1956\n| rank          = [[File:Lieutenant Colonel of the Indian Army.svg|25px]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]]\n| servicenumber = IC-3472\n| unit          = [[Gorkha Rifles|3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n| awards        = [[File:Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|30px]] [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]]\n}}\n\n[[Lieutenant Colonel]] Jagannath Raoji Chitnis,AC (20 August 1918 - 14 June 1956) was an Indian Army officer in 3 [[Gorkha Rifles]] who was  posthumously awarded India's highest peacetime military decoration Ashoka Chakra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thankyouindianarmy.com \u203a ...\nLieutenant colonel JR Chitnis {{!}} Thank You Indian Army|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Early life==\n[[Lieutenant Colonel]] Jagannath Raoji Chitnis was born on 20th August 1918 in [[Satara]], [[Maharashtra]].

He was liberated on the urging of [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon]] (1677\u20131749), legitimized daughter of [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, marquise de Montespan]]. Fran\u00e7oise-Marie was also married at the time to [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]. She was thus a well-connected patroness. \n\nIn 1709, Lestocq arrived in [[Saint Petersburg]] in the capacity of a court [[physician]]. He was well regarded by [[Catherine I of Russia]] until 1720, when [[Peter I of Russia|her husband]] had him exiled to [[Kazan]] for having seduced a jester's daughter. Upon the Emperor's death, Catherine summoned her favourite physician to the Russian capital, where his light-hearted character made him friends with her daughter [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], whom he reportedly cured of [[syphilis]].\n\nMore than anyone else, Lestocq helped prepare the 1741 [[coup d'etat]] which brought Elizaveta to the throne. He shaped Elizaveta's actions according to the advice of the French ambassador [[Marquis de La Ch\u00e9tardie]] and the Swedish ambassador, who were particularly interested in toppling the regime of [[Anna Leopoldovna]], as France sought to counterbalance the Austrian influence at the Russian court and Sweden [[Lesser Wrath|waged a war]] against Russia at that time.\n\nAfter Elizaveta's coronation, Lestocq and La Chetardie attempted to dominate state power. The physician received a pension of 15,000 livres from the king of France and sought to influence Russian foreign policy accordingly. Another beneficiary from Lestocq's intrigues was the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], who persuaded [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VII]] to make him an imperial count. In 1743, Lestocq forged the so-called [[Lopukhina Conspiracy]] to engineer the downfall of Chancellor [[Aleksey Bestuzhev]]. It was he who suggested [[Sophie Augusta Fredericka of Anhalt-Zerbst]] (the future Catherine the Great), a Prussian prot\u00e9g\u00e9, as a bride for the heir apparent.\n\nIn 1745 Bestuzhev, still in power, succeeded in intercepting Lestocq's correspondence with La Chetardie, which resulted in the latter being banished from Russia. Three years later Lestocq, who continued to intrigue against Bestuzhev, was accused of plotting to dethrone Elizaveta in favor of the [[Peter III of Russia|Prussophile heir to the throne]]. He and his aide de camp, [[Alexander Chappuzeau]], nephew of his brother [[Johann Ludwig von L\u2019Estocq]], were both arrested. L'Estocq was tortured in the Secret Chancellery and sentenced to death. The Empress intervened and had him instead exiled, first to [[Uglich]] and then to [[Veliky Ustyug]]. Only upon her death was Lestocq restored to his estates and allowed to return to the Russian capital.\n\nLestocq was married first to Barbara von Rutenhjelm, then to Alida M\u00fcller, described as 'dirty and drunken', who died in November 1743.<ref>''M\u00e9moires du prince Pierre Dolgoroukow'', by Pierre Dolgoroukow, Cherbuliez et H.

The university started off with multiple locations in [[Pangkal Pinang]] and [[Sungailiat]], being effectively operated by the provincial government despite formally being under the authority of the central government.
