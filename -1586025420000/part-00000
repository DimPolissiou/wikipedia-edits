Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.<ref name=TRNCInfo/>\n\nA more recent estimate, in 2011, by the [[Home Affairs Committee]] states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom<ref name=HomeAffairsCommittee/> though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000.<ref name=StarKibris/> Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000\u2013120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia,<ref name=StarK/><ref name=StarKibris/><ref name=BRT/> 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.<ref name=StarK/>\n\n===Turkey===\n{{see also|Muhacir}}\n[[File:T\u00fcrkiye\u2019ye g\u00f6\u00e7 eden bir K\u0131br\u0131sl\u0131 T\u00fcrk ailesi (1930).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Turkish Cypriot family who migrated to Turkey in 1935.]]\nThe first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the [[Ottoman Empire]] leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the [[First World War]], and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the [[Second World War]] in the 1940s and during the [[Cyprus conflict]] of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nInitially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=276\"/> The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=280\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=280}}.</ref> The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000\u20136,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=281\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=281}}.</ref>\n\nMetin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:\n{{Quotation|The first wave of immigration from Cyprus occurred in 1878 when the Ottomans were obliged to lease the island to Great Britain; at that time, 15,000 people moved to Anatolia. When the 1923 Lausanne Treaty gave the island to Great Britain another 30,000 immigrants came to Turkey.<ref name=\"Heper & Criss 2009 loc=92\"/>}}\n\nSt. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:\n{{Quotation|\"[I]f the Turkish-Cypriot community had, like the Greek-Cypriots, increased by 101 percent between 1881 and 1931, it would have totalled 91,300 in 1931 \u2013 27,000 more than the number enumerated. Is it possible that so many Turkish-Cypriots emigrated in the fifty-year period? Taken together, the considerations just mentioned suggest that it probably was. From a base of 45,000 in 1881, emigration of anything like 27,000 persons seems huge, but after subtracting the known 5,000 of the 1920s, the balance represents an average annual outflow of some 500 \u2013 not enough, probably, to concern the community\u2019s leaders, evoke official comment, or be documented in any way which survives today\".<ref name=\"St. John-Jones 1983 loc=56\"/>}}\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the [[Second World War]] (1939\u20131945).<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=276\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=276}}.</ref> According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878\u20131945.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bilge|1961|loc=5}}.</ref> By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, [[Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu]], at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: \n{{Quotation|Consequently, today [1955] as well, when we take into account the state of the population in Cyprus, it is not sufficient to say, for instance, that 100,000 Turks live there.

Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.<ref name=TRNCInfo/>\n\nA more recent estimate, in 2011, by the [[Home Affairs Committee]] states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom<ref name=HomeAffairsCommittee/> though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000.<ref name=StarKibris/> Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000\u2013120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia,<ref name=StarK/><ref name=StarKibris/><ref name=BRT/> 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.<ref name=StarK/>\n\n===Turkey===\n{{see also|Muhacir}}\n[[File:T\u00fcrkiye\u2019ye g\u00f6\u00e7 eden bir K\u0131br\u0131sl\u0131 T\u00fcrk ailesi (1930).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Turkish Cypriot family who migrated to Turkey in 1935.]]\nThe first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the [[Ottoman Empire]] leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the [[First World War]], and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the [[Second World War]] in the 1940s and during the [[Cyprus conflict]] of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nInitially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=276\"/> The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=280\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=280}}.</ref> The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000\u20136,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=281\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=281}}.</ref>\n\nMetin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:\n{{Quotation|The first wave of immigration from Cyprus occurred in 1878 when the Ottomans were obliged to lease the island to Great Britain; at that time, 15,000 people moved to Anatolia. When the 1923 Lausanne Treaty gave the island to Great Britain another 30,000 immigrants came to Turkey.<ref name=\"Heper & Criss 2009 loc=92\"/>}}\n\nSt. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:\n{{Quotation|\"[I]f the Turkish-Cypriot community had, like the Greek-Cypriots, increased by 101 percent between 1881 and 1931, it would have totalled 91,300 in 1931 \u2013 27,000 more than the number enumerated. Is it possible that so many Turkish-Cypriots emigrated in the fifty-year period? Taken together, the considerations just mentioned suggest that it probably was. From a base of 45,000 in 1881, emigration of anything like 27,000 persons seems huge, but after subtracting the known 5,000 of the 1920s, the balance represents an average annual outflow of some 500 \u2013 not enough, probably, to concern the community\u2019s leaders, evoke official comment, or be documented in any way which survives today\".<ref name=\"St. John-Jones 1983 loc=56\"/>}}\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the [[Second World War]] (1939\u20131945).<ref name=\"Nevzat 2005 loc=276\">{{Harvnb|Nevzat|2005|loc=276}}.</ref> According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878\u20131945.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bilge|1961|loc=5}}.</ref> By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, [[Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu]], at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: \n{{Quotation|Consequently, today [1955] as well, when we take into account the state of the population in Cyprus, it is not sufficient to say, for instance, that 100,000 Turks live there.

The constituencies which returned one or two members to the UK Parliament, between 1922 and 1950, were used for Northern Ireland devolved elections in the 1921\u201329 period.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1969 there were 48 single member constituencies, using the [[first past the post]] method of election. The non-territorial [[University constituency]] continued to return 4 members using the single transferable vote.\n\nFor the 1969 election 4 new territorial constituencies were created to replace the University seats. The 52 constituencies ceased to exist after the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was suspended in 1972 and abolished in 1973.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!

Ireland 1921-72}}\nThe [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]] existed from 1921 to 1973 as the lower House of the devolved legislature of the part of the [[United Kingdom]] called [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nAs in the [[UK Parliament]] the constituencies were classified as [[Borough constituencies|borough]], [[County constituencies|county]] or [[University constituencies|university]] constituencies.\n\nIn 1921\u201329 the 52 provincial  [[Members of Parliament]] were elected using [[proportional representation]] by the [[single transferable vote]] in multi member constituencies. The constituencies which returned one or two members to the UK Parliament, between 1922 and 1950, were used for Northern Ireland devolved elections in the 1921\u201329 period.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1969 there were 48 single member constituencies, using the [[first past the post]] method of election. The non-territorial [[University constituency]] continued to return 4 members using the single transferable vote.\n\nFor the 1969 election 4 new territorial constituencies were created to replace the University seats. The 52 constituencies ceased to exist after the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was suspended in 1972 and abolished in 1973.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!

From 1969 there were nine county divisions in Antrim, but the changes in the vicinity of [[Belfast]] did not affect the boundaries of this division.\n\nIt comprised (in terms of local government units existing in 1929) parts of the [[Rural District|rural districts]] of [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Ballymoney]] together with the whole of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] of Ballycastle, Ballymoney and [[Portrush]].\n\nIt returned one member of Parliament from 1929 until the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972|temporarily suspended]] in 1972, and then [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973|formally abolished]] in 1973.\n\n==Politics==\nCounty Antrim (except for parts of Belfast) is a strongly unionist area. There has never been the slightest chance of a republican or nationalist candidate being elected in a single-member Antrim [[county constituency]], however the boundaries were drawn. ''Antrim North'' has not been an exception.\n\nAt the Northern Ireland general election of 1929 the new ''Antrim North'' division was the scene of a reasonably close Unionist/Liberal contest (less than a 20% majority). However this was the last appearance of a Liberal candidate for the Northern Ireland Parliament constituency, which became an extremely safe Unionist seat for the rest of its existence.\n\n==Members

Commons]].\n\nThe ''House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland), 1929'' introduced [[first past the post|first-past-the-post]] elections for 48 single-member constituencies (including ''Antrim North'').\n\nThis constituency was one of seven county divisions in Antrim, so it was smaller than the [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|UK Parliament seat]]. From 1969 there were nine county divisions in Antrim, but the changes in the vicinity of [[Belfast]] did not affect the boundaries of this division.\n\nIt comprised (in terms of local government units existing in 1929) parts of the [[Rural District|rural districts]] of [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Ballymoney]] together with the whole of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] of Ballycastle, Ballymoney and [[Portrush]].\n\nIt returned one member of Parliament from 1929 until the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972|temporarily suspended]] in 1972, and then [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973|formally abolished]] in 1973.\n\n==Politics==\nCounty Antrim (except for parts of Belfast) is a strongly unionist area. There has never been the slightest chance of a republican or nationalist candidate being elected in a single-member Antrim [[county constituency]], however the boundaries were drawn. ''Antrim North'' has not been an exception.\n\nAt the Northern Ireland general election of 1929 the new ''Antrim North'' division was the scene of a reasonably close Unionist/Liberal contest (less than a 20% majority). However this was the last appearance of a Liberal candidate for the Northern Ireland Parliament constituency, which became an extremely safe Unionist seat for the rest of its existence.\n\n==Members

The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] won 40 seats, while [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] (the successor to the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]) won six seats each; 5 of those elected for Sinn F\u00e9in were also elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland, while Nationalist Party leader Joseph Devlin was elected to two seats in Northern Ireland.

The Second D\u00e1il lasted 388 days.\n\nIn the [[1921 Northern Ireland general election|election]] to the area designated as [[Northern Ireland]], 52 members were elected from 9 geographic constituencies and [[Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Queen's University of Belfast]]. The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] won 40 seats, while [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] (the successor to the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]) won six seats each; 5 of those elected for Sinn F\u00e9in were also elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland, while Nationalist Party leader Joseph Devlin was elected to two seats in Northern Ireland. On 7 June [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Sir James Craig]], leader of the UUP, became the first [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].\n\nIn the election to the area designated as [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]], 124 Sinn F\u00e9in candidates were returned unopposed from 26 geographic constituencies and the [[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]] constituency.<ref name=ei-2nd-dail>{{cite web |url=http://www.electionsireland.org/results/general/02dail.cfm |title=General Election of 24 May 1921 |website=ElectionsIreland.org |access-date=4 September 2010}}</ref> The [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] constituency returned four Independent [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] candidates, also unopposed. The four Independent Unionists met as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland on 28 June 1921, for one meeting only.\n\nThose elected for Sinn F\u00e9in sat as the Second D\u00e1il, calling themselves [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs). There were 125 TDs, taking into account that five represented two constituencies. The others elected did not respond to the invitation.

The Tigers' opening drive resulted in a [[three-and-out]], and Alabama took over on their own 21-yard-line following a punt. However, three plays later the scoring was opened by Clemson [[cornerback]] [[A. J. Terrell]], who intercepted a [[Tua Tagovailoa]] pass and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. Alabama responded quickly, as Tagovailoa made up for the interception three plays later by finding [[Jerry Jeudy]] downfield for a 62-yard score. On their ensuing drive, Clemson continued the offensive trend of the first quarter with a 62-yard pass of their own, from [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] to [[Tee Higgins]], which set up a 17-yard touchdown rush by [[Travis Etienne]] on the next play. Now trailing 14\u20137, Alabama marched downfield on their next drive, covering 75 yards in ten plays, to score a touchdown with opportunity to tie the game. However, Alabama freshman [[placekicker]] Joseph Bulovas missed the [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]], hitting the right upright; this was his sixth missed extra point of the season and left Clemson ahead by one, 14\u201313. Clemson's ensuing drive resulted in another three-and-out; they punted to Alabama, who made it to the Clemson 3-yard-line when the first quarter ended.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/08/college-football-playoff-national-championship-clemson-v-alabama-live |title=Alabama v Clemson: College Football Playoff national championship 2019 \u2013 live! |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 7, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=sportingnews>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/alabama-clemson-score-results-highlights-tigers-dismantle-tide-for-college-football-playoff-title/1m81pcoyetiy11mv32cyb90mu |title=Alabama vs. Clemson results: Score, highlights as Tigers dismantle Tide for College Football Playoff title |first=Jacob |last=Janower |website=[[Sporting News]] |date=January 7, 2018 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=zebras>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballzebras.com/2019/01/2019-national-championship-liveblog-alabama-vs-clemson/ |title=2019 National Championship liveblog: Alabama vs. Clemson |website=footballzebras.com |date=January 7, 2018 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second quarter began with Clemson holding a one-point lead, although this would not last for long. Two plays into the quarter, Bulovas converted a 25-yard [[field goal]] to put Alabama in front by two points, 16\u201314. Clemson would soon recapture the lead, as Lawrence led the Tigers' offense down the field in six plays; the drive was capped by a one-yard touchdown rush by Travis Etienne. With the Clemson lead at 21\u201316, Alabama began their next drive. The Clemson defense would make another important play, as Tagovailoa threw his second interception of the game and only his sixth all season. Clemson then capitalized with a five-yard pass from Lawrence to Etienne to make push the lead to 12 points, 28\u201316. On what would be their last drive of the half, Alabama punted on 4th-and-17, giving Clemson the ball on their own 21-yard-line. With just over two minutes on the clock, Clemson drove down the field and converted a 36-yard field goal that put the lead at 31\u201316 and gave the Tide the ball back with 45 seconds. After an incomplete pass and a six-yard rush, Alabama head coach [[Nick Saban]] elected to let the clock expire and head to halftime trailing by fifteen.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/>\n\nOn Alabama's first drive of the second half, they gained 53 yards on 12 plays before losing two yards on a [[fake field goal]], turning the ball over on downs and giving the Tigers the football on their own 24-yard-line. Clemson took advantage of the Tide's mistake, scoring on a 74-yard Trevor Lawrence pass to [[Justyn Ross]]. [[Greg Huegel]]'s extra point attempt hit the left upright, leaving the score at 37\u201316; it was only his second missed extra point of the season. Alabama's next drive spanned 59 yards before they failed to convert a 4th-and-4 on Clemson's 14-yard-line, giving the Tigers the ball with just under six minutes to play in the third quarter. Clemson took advantage, driving 89 yards for a touchdown with a five-yard touchdown catch by Tee Higgins; the successful extra point pushing their lead to 44\u201316. Alabama's 28-point deficit was the largest in any game under Saban, their coach since 2007. The Tide began their third drive of the second half on their 25-yard-line following a touchback.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/>\n\nFollowing a 48-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Jeudy on the final play of the third quarter, Alabama started the fourth quarter with a first down on Clemson's 27-yard-line. However, Alabama's offense stalled again, losing seven yards on 4th-and-goal from Clemson's 2-yard-line; this was the Tide's third straight turnover on downs, with all three coming in Clemson territory. Clemson was then unable to take advantage of their possession, and punted for the first time since the first quarter; the punt was downed at Alabama's 48-yard-line. Alabama began their fourth second-half drive with just over eleven minutes on the clock and [[Jalen Hurts]] at [[quarterback]]; it ended in a three-and-out, and Mike Bernier's punt was downed at the Clemson one-yard-line. After draining more than seven minutes on the clock and with the ball on Alabama's 17-yard-line, the majority of Clemson's offensive starters were removed from the game and Chase Brice was put in at quarterback. Clemson used up the remaining two minutes off the clock and took a knee on the final play ending the longest drive (10:02) in Clemson history and winning the National Championship, their second title in three years.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/><ref name=longest>{{cite web |url=https://247sports.com/college/clemson/Article/Clemson-football-break-records-national-championship--127507016/ |title=Clemson becomes first 15-0 team since 1897 |website=247sports.com |date=January 8, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:2019 CFP - Clemson goes on field 2.jpg|Clemson players celebrate in the end zone near the majority of their fans.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 4.jpg|Fireworks went off after the conclusion of the game.\nFile:Clemson-Alabama-20190107-Levis.jpg|Clemson is recognized historical 15\u20130 national champion as confetti falls after the game.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 6.jpg|Clemson players take the stage to receive the trophy.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 8.jpg|Clemson's coach and players are presented with the championship trophy.\n</gallery>\n\n===Scoring summary===\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=Clemson|HomeName=Alabama|state=}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=13:20\n| Team=Clemson\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=IntTD\n| Def=A.

The Tigers' opening drive resulted in a [[three-and-out]], and Alabama took over on their own 21-yard-line following a punt. However, three plays later the scoring was opened by Clemson [[cornerback]] [[A. J. Terrell]], who intercepted a [[Tua Tagovailoa]] pass and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. Alabama responded quickly, as Tagovailoa made up for the interception three plays later by finding [[Jerry Jeudy]] downfield for a 62-yard score. On their ensuing drive, Clemson continued the offensive trend of the first quarter with a 62-yard pass of their own, from [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] to [[Tee Higgins]], which set up a 17-yard touchdown rush by [[Travis Etienne]] on the next play. Now trailing 14\u20137, Alabama marched downfield on their next drive, covering 75 yards in ten plays, to score a touchdown with opportunity to tie the game. However, Alabama freshman [[placekicker]] Joseph Bulovas missed the [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]], hitting the right upright; this was his sixth missed extra point of the season and left Clemson ahead by one, 14\u201313. Clemson's ensuing drive resulted in another three-and-out; they punted to Alabama, who made it to the Clemson 3-yard-line when the first quarter ended.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/08/college-football-playoff-national-championship-clemson-v-alabama-live |title=Alabama v Clemson: College Football Playoff national championship 2019 \u2013 live! |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 7, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=sportingnews>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/alabama-clemson-score-results-highlights-tigers-dismantle-tide-for-college-football-playoff-title/1m81pcoyetiy11mv32cyb90mu |title=Alabama vs. Clemson results: Score, highlights as Tigers dismantle Tide for College Football Playoff title |first=Jacob |last=Janower |website=[[Sporting News]] |date=January 7, 2018 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=zebras>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballzebras.com/2019/01/2019-national-championship-liveblog-alabama-vs-clemson/ |title=2019 National Championship liveblog: Alabama vs. Clemson |website=footballzebras.com |date=January 7, 2018 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second quarter began with Clemson holding a one-point lead, although this would not last for long. Two plays into the quarter, Bulovas converted a 25-yard [[field goal]] to put Alabama in front by two points, 16\u201314. Clemson would soon recapture the lead, as Lawrence led the Tigers' offense down the field in six plays; the drive was capped by a one-yard touchdown rush by Travis Etienne. With the Clemson lead at 21\u201316, Alabama began their next drive. The Clemson defense would make another important play, as Tagovailoa threw his second interception of the game and only his sixth all season. Clemson then capitalized with a five-yard pass from Lawrence to Etienne to make push the lead to 12 points, 28\u201316. On what would be their last drive of the half, Alabama punted on 4th-and-17, giving Clemson the ball on their own 21-yard-line. With just over two minutes on the clock, Clemson drove down the field and converted a 36-yard field goal that put the lead at 31\u201316 and gave the Tide the ball back with 45 seconds. After an incomplete pass and a six-yard rush, Alabama head coach [[Nick Saban]] elected to let the clock expire and head to halftime trailing by fifteen.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/>\n\nOn Alabama's first drive of the second half, they gained 53 yards on 12 plays before losing two yards on a [[fake field goal]], turning the ball over on downs and giving the Tigers the football on their own 24-yard-line. Clemson took advantage of the Tide's mistake, scoring on a 74-yard Trevor Lawrence pass to [[Justyn Ross]]. [[Greg Huegel]]'s extra point attempt hit the left upright, leaving the score at 37\u201316; it was only his second missed extra point of the season. Alabama's next drive spanned 59 yards before they failed to convert a 4th-and-4 on Clemson's 14-yard-line, giving the Tigers the ball with just under six minutes to play in the third quarter. Clemson took advantage, driving 89 yards for a touchdown with a five-yard touchdown catch by Tee Higgins; the successful extra point pushing their lead to 44\u201316. Alabama's 28-point deficit was the largest in any game under Saban, their coach since 2007. The Tide began their third drive of the second half on their 25-yard-line following a touchback.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/>\n\nFollowing a 48-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Jeudy on the final play of the third quarter, Alabama started the fourth quarter with a first down on Clemson's 27-yard-line. However, Alabama's offense stalled again, losing seven yards on 4th-and-goal from Clemson's 2-yard-line; this was the Tide's third straight turnover on downs, with all three coming in Clemson territory. Clemson was then unable to take advantage of their possession, and punted for the first time since the first quarter; the punt was downed at Alabama's 48-yard-line. Alabama began their fourth second-half drive with just over eleven minutes on the clock and [[Jalen Hurts]] at [[quarterback]]; it ended in a three-and-out, and Mike Bernier's punt was downed at the Clemson one-yard-line. After draining more than seven minutes on the clock and with the ball on Alabama's 17-yard-line, the majority of Clemson's offensive starters were removed from the game and Chase Brice was put in at quarterback. Clemson used up the remaining two minutes off the clock and took a knee on the final play ending the longest drive (10:02) in Clemson history and winning the National Championship, their second title in three years.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=sportingnews/><ref name=zebras/><ref name=longest>{{cite web |url=https://247sports.com/college/clemson/Article/Clemson-football-break-records-national-championship--127507016/ |title=Clemson becomes first 15-0 team since 1897 |website=247sports.com |date=January 8, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:2019 CFP - Clemson goes on field 2.jpg|Clemson players celebrate in the end zone near the majority of their fans.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 4.jpg|Fireworks went off after the conclusion of the game.\nFile:Clemson-Alabama-20190107-Levis.jpg|Clemson is recognized historical 15\u20130 national champion as confetti falls after the game.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 6.jpg|Clemson players take the stage to receive the trophy.\nFile:2019 CFP - post-game celebrations 8.jpg|Clemson's coach and players are presented with the championship trophy.\n</gallery>\n\n===Scoring summary===\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=Clemson|HomeName=Alabama|state=}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=13:20\n| Team=Clemson\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=IntTD\n| Def=A.
