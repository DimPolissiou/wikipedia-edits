They are very tall in stature, with rippling muscles under clear white skin. Their hair is blond, but not naturally so: they bleach it, to this day, artificially, washing it in lime and combing it back from their foreheads. They look like wood-demons, their hair thick and shaggy like a horse's mane.

The modern trend is to use several colors to produce streaks or gradations, but not all work on top of a single base color. These are referred to as:\n\n* ''Highlighting'', where sections of hair are treated with lighteners\n* ''Lowlighting'', where sections of hair are treated with darker hair colors\n* ''Splashlighting'' a horizontal band of bleached hair from ear to ear\n\nThere are also newer coloring techniques such as ombr\u00e9, in which hair is dark on the crown and bit by bit becomes lighter toward the ends.\n\nThese are off-the-scalp techniques, and can be applied by the following methods:\n\n* ''Foiling'', where pieces of foil or plastic film are used to separate the hair to be colored, especially when applying more than one color (This ensures the color is applied only to the desired strands of hair, and protects the strands of hair not intended to be dyed.) \n* ''Cap'', when a plastic cap is placed tightly on the head and strands are pulled through with a hook (This method is not frequently practiced, with the exception of highlighting short hair.) \n* ''Balayage'', where hair color is painted directly onto sections of the hair with no foils used to keep the color contained (This method is growing in popularity because of its ability to look more natural.) The difference between balayage and ombr\u00e9 is that a balayage requires more precise hand-painting sections of hair and typically costs more. \n* ''[[Dip dye|Dipping or tip dyeing]]'', similar to balayage in that the color is painted directly on the hair (This results in a more solid level of coverage on the ends of the hair.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenio.com/664/dip-dye-hair-coloring-tutorial-and-styles|title=Dip-Dye Hair Coloring Tutorial and Styles|last=Wilson|first=Cynthia|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Womenio|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAll coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be [[bleach]]ed before coloring.\n\n===On-scalp===\nHair coloring can also be applied on the scalp for a more solid level of coverage \n* ''Root touch-up'', where color is applied only to the most recent section of re-growth (usually the first inch of hair nearest the scalp) Root touch-ups are repeated every 4\u20136 weeks as the natural color grows in and becomes apparent. People who color their hair to disguise gray often have these root touch-ups. \n* ''All-over color'', where the person wants all of their hair to be a different solid color \n* ''Block coloring'', where the person wants two or more colors applied to their hair, resulting in dimension and contrast\n\nAll coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be [[bleach]]ed before coloring.\n\n==Types ==\nThe four most common classifications are ''permanent'', ''demi-permanent'' (sometimes called ''deposit only''), ''semi-permanent'', and ''temporary''.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n=== Permanent ===\nPermanent hair color generally contains ammonia and must be mixed with a developer or oxidizing agent in order to permanently change hair color. Ammonia is used in permanent hair color to open the [[cuticle]] layer so that the developer and colorants together can penetrate into the [[cortex (hair)|cortex]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Hair Color 101: Permanent Hair Color from Clairol Professional|url = http://www.clairolpro.com/inside-clairol-pro/permanent-hair-color|website = www.clairolpro.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref> The developer, or oxidizing agent, comes in various volumes. The higher the developer volume, the higher the \"lift\" will be of a person's natural hair pigment. Someone with dark hair wishing to achieve two or three shades lighter may need a higher developer whereas someone with lighter hair wishing to achieve darker hair will not need one as high. Timing may vary with permanent hair coloring but is typically 30 minutes or 45 minutes for those wishing to achieve maximum color change............\n\n===Demi-permanent ===\n[[Half|Demi-permanent]] hair color is hair color that contains an alkaline agent other than ammonia (e.g. [[ethanolamine]], [[sodium carbonate]]) and, while always employed with a developer, the concentration of [[hydrogen peroxide]] in that developer may be lower than used with a permanent hair color. Since the alkaline agents employed in demi-permanent colors are less effective in removing the natural pigment of hair than ammonia these products provide no lightening of hair's color during dyeing. As the result, they cannot color hair to a lighter shade than it was before dyeing and are less damaging to hair than their permanent counterpart.\n\nDemi-permanents are much more effective at covering gray hair than semi-permanents, but less so than permanents.\n\nDemi-permanents have several advantages as compared with permanent color. Because there is essentially no lifting (i.e., removal) of natural hair color, the final color is less uniform/homogeneous than a permanent and therefore more natural looking; they are gentler on hair and therefore safer, especially for damaged hair; and they wash out over time (typically 20 to 28 shampoos), so root regrowth is less noticeable and if a change of color is desired, it is easier to achieve. Demi-permanent hair colors are not permanent but the darker shades in particular may persist longer than indicated on the packet.\n\n===Semi-permanent ===\n[[Semi-]]permanent hair coloring involves little or no developer, hydrogen peroxide or ammonia, and is thus less damaging to hair strands. The reduced amount of developer, whether peroxide or ammonia, means that hair previously damaged by applying permanent color or permanent reshaping is less likely to be damaged during the color application process.\n\nSemi-permanent hair color uses compounds of lower [[molecular weight]] than are found in temporary hair color dyes. These dyes penetrate the hair shaft only partially, because of the reduced amount of developer used. For this reason, the color will survive repeated washing, typically 4\u20135 shampoos or a few weeks, before undergoing significant fading or washing out entirely.\n\nSemi-permanents may still contain the suspected carcinogen [[p-phenylenediamine]] (PPD) or other related colorants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that in rats and mice chronically exposed to PPD in their diet, the PPT appears to simply depress body weight of the animals, with no other clinical signs of toxicity observed in several studies.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/phenylen.html p-Phenylenediamine], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ref>\n\nThe final color of each strand of hair will depend on its original color and porosity. Because hair's color and porosity across the head and along the length of a hair strand, there will be subtle variations in shade across the entire head. This gives a more natural-looking result than the solid, all over color of a permanent color. Because gray or white hairs have a different starting color than other hair, they will not appear as the same shade as the rest of the hair when treated with semi-permanent color. If there are only a few grey/white hairs, the effect will usually be enough for them to blend in, but as the gray spreads, there will come a point where it will not be disguised as well. In this case, the move to permanent color can sometimes be delayed by using the semi-permanent as a base and adding highlights.\n\nSemi-permanent color cannot lighten the hair.\n\n===Temporary color===\nTemporary hair color is available in various forms including rinses, shampoos, gels, sprays, and foams. Temporary hair color is typically brighter and more vibrant than semi-permanent and permanent hair color. It is most often used to color hair for special occasions such as costume parties and [[Halloween]].\n\nThe pigments in temporary hair color are high molecular weight and cannot penetrate the cuticle layer. The color particles remain [[wikt:adsorb|adsorbed]] (closely adherent) to the surface of the hair shaft and are easily removed with a single shampooing. Temporary hair color can persist on hair that is excessively dry or damaged in a way that allows for migration of the pigment to the interior of the hair shaft.\n\n===Alternative color===\n[[Image:Jeff-blue-beard-sized.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hair and beard colored blue]]\nAlternative hair coloring products are designed to create hair colors not typically found in nature. These are also referred to as \"vivid color\" in the hairstyling industry. The available colors are diverse, such as the colors green and fuchsia.\nPermanent alternatives in some colors are available. More recently, [[blacklight]]-reactive hair dyes have been brought to market that [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under blacklights, such as those often used at nightclubs.\n\nThe chemical formulae of alternative color dyes typically contain only tint and have no developer. This means that they will only create the bright color of the packet if they are applied to light blond hair. Darker hair (medium brown to black) would need to be bleached in order for these pigment applications to take to the hair desirably. Some types of fair hair may also take vivid colors more fully after bleaching. Gold, yellow and orange undertones in hair that has not been lightened enough can muddy the final hair color, especially with pink, [[Blue hair|blue]] and green dyes. Although some alternative colors are semi-permanent, such as blue and purple, it could take several months to fully wash the color from bleached or pre-lightened hair.\n\n== Maintaining hair color ==\nThere are many ways that people can maintain their hair color, such as:\n* Using color-protecting shampoos and conditioners\n* Using sulfate-free shampoo\n* Using purple shampoos and conditioners to maintain or enhance the blond color in their hair\n* Using leave-in treatments with UV absorbents\n* Getting deep-conditioning treatments to smooth and add luster \n* Avoiding chlorine\n* Using heat protecting products before using styling appliances\n\n== Adverse effects ==\nHair coloring involves the use of chemicals capable of removing, replacing, and/or covering up pigments naturally found inside the hair shaft. Use of these chemicals can result in a range of adverse effects, including temporary skin irritation and allergy, hair breakage, skin discoloration and unexpected hair color results. According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), in vitro and in vivo studies (in exposed human populations) have shown that some hair dyes and many chemicals used in the hair dyeing process can be considered [[mutagenic]] and [[carcinogenic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=1993|title=IARC working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans: occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers and personal use of hair colorants; some hair dyes, cosmetic colorants, industrial dyestuffs and aromatic amines.

Individuals allergic to gluten for example, will need to be cautious when purchasing hair color since certain hair dye includes gluten. Gluten does not need to be ingested for it to cause an allergy. Skin contact with gluten may cause a reaction; therefore, leading to an allergy. Symptoms of these reactions can include redness, sores, itching, burning sensation and discomfort. Symptoms will sometimes not be apparent immediately following the application and processing of the tint, but can also arise after hours or even a day later.\n\nTo help prevent or limit allergic reactions, the majority of hair color products recommend that the client conduct a [[patch test]] before using the product. This involves mixing a small quantity of tint preparation and applying it directly to the skin for a period of 48 hours. If irritation develops, manufacturers recommend that the client not use the product.\n\nEuropean dermatologists have, however, strongly advised against such pre-use testing, as it entails additional sensitisation (allergy) risk and the interpretation by lay people may not be sufficiently accurate.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.2012.02078.x |pmid=22568836 |title=Self-testing for contact sensitization to hair dyes - scientific considerations and clinical concerns of an industry-led screening programme |journal=Contact Dermatitis |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=300\u2013311 |year=2012 |last1=Thyssen |first1=Jacob P. |last2=S\u00f8sted |first2=Heidi |last3=Uter |first3=Wolfgang |last4=Schnuch |first4=Axel |last5=Gim\u00e9nez-Arnau |first5=Ana M. |last6=Vigan |first6=Martine |last7=Rustemeyer |first7=Thomas |last8=Granum |first8=Berit |last9=McFadden |first9=John |last10=White |first10=Jonathan M. |last11=White |first11=Ian R. |last12=Goossens |first12=Ann |last13=Menn\u00e9 |first13=Torkil |last14=Lid\u00e9n |first14=Carola |last15=Johansen |first15=Jeanne D. }}</ref>\n\n===Skin discoloration===\nSkin and fingernails are made of a similar type of keratinized protein as hair. That means that drips, slips and extra hair tint around the hairline can result in patches of discolored skin. This is more common with darker hair colors and persons with dry absorbent skin. That is why it is recommended that latex or nitrile gloves be worn to protect the hands.\n\nThis discoloration will disappear as the skin naturally renews itself and the top layer of skin is removed (typically takes a few days or at most a week). Ways of preventing skin discoloration are to wear latex or nitrile gloves to protect the hands and also by applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly or oil-based preparation around the hairline. Gentle abrasives such as moist baking soda or a small amount of toothpaste applied with a toothbrush may also help remove the uppermost layer of skin and dye (neither removes just the dye). Acetone and nail polish remover are not considered effective; laundry detergent may sometimes work as may moist cigarette ash rubbed into the stained area.<ref>Alexandra Tunell, [http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/advice/a4503/how-to-remove-hair-dye/ How to Get Hair Dye off Your Skin], Harper's Bazaar, Oct 2, 2016</ref>\n\n===Unintended results===\n{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}\nSeveral factors influence the final color of the hair following the coloring process.\n\n* For semi-permanent and demi-permanent color, the final color is a blend of the natural color of the hair and the dye color.\n* Bleached hair will often require pre-pigmentation before a color application. Dyeing bleached hair brown can result in grey or very ashy (grey sheen) hair.\n* Previously color treated hair can react unpredictably with subsequent color treatments.\n* Previous use of shampoos which deposit a layer of plastic on the hair can block the action of the dye.\n* Presence of minerals, salts, chlorine or other contaminants in the water used in the coloring process\n* Certain prescription drugs can alter hair chemistry\n* Coloring dark hair to achieve a desirable shade of blond requires bleaching, followed by a secondary color treatment. Bleached hair can still have a yellow or coppery shade. A violet-based color can cancel out yellow tones, and a blue-based shade will cancel out coppery orange.\n* Porosity of hair can affect the final shade. Porous hair often absorbs more color, which sometimes results darker than expected\n\n===Health concerns===\n* The salt [[lead acetate]] (the active ingredient in gradual darkening products such as [[Grecian formula]]) is toxic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/brands?tbl=brands&id=3022002|title=Household Products Database - Health and Safety Information on Household Products|website=hpd.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Riaz|first1=Almas|title=Shampoo for color treated hair|url=http://www.tuneyourhair.com/best-shampoo-for-color-treated-hair/|website=Tune Your Hair|publisher=The Hair Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Tukker |first1=Arnold |last2=Buijst |first2=Harrie |last3=Van Oers |first3=Lauren |last4=Van Der Voet |first4=Ester |title=Risks to Health and the Environment Related to the Use of Lead in Products |year=2001 |url=http://www.dphu.org/uploads/attachements/books/books_760_0.pdf }}</ref> Lead acetate trihydrate has also been shown to cause reproductive toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=James|title=Reproductive toxicology.

The process is typically performed under basic conditions. The mechanism of oxidation dyes involves three steps:<ref name=Ullmann/>\n1) Oxidation of 1,4-diaminobenzene derivative to the quinone state.\n2) Reaction of this diimine with a coupler compound (more detail below).\n3) Oxidation of the resulting compound to give the final dye.\n\nThe preparation (dye precursors) is in the leuco (colorless) form. Oxidizing agents are usually [[hydrogen peroxide]], and the alkaline environment is usually provided by ammonia. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia causes the natural hair to be lightened, providing a \"blank canvas\" for the dye. Ammonia opens the hair shaft pores so that the dye can actually diffuse inside the fiber. These dye intermediates and coupler compounds can undergo oxidation and coupling reaction as shown in the scheme below to form high molecular weight products, which are trapped in the hair matrix and cannot be readily removed through washing.\n\nVarious combinations of primary intermediates and coupler compounds provide a spectrum of shades of hair colors. The primary intermediates are aromatic para compounds, such as 1,4-diaminobenzene or 4-aminophenol. The coupler compounds (couplers) are meta-substituted derivatives of [[aniline]]. They come in three major classes based on the color that they produce when they react with the primary intermediate.\n\n:[[File:HairChemicals.svg|thumb|720px|center|Couplers are chemical compounds that define the color of the hair dye. Shown here are three red couplers (A, B, C), two yellow-green couplers (D, E) and a blue coupler (F).]]\n*Blue couplers include [[1,3-Diaminobenzene|1,3-diaminobenzene]] and its derivatives.\n*Red couplers include phenols and naphthols, such as 3-aminophenol (CAS#591-27-5), 5-amino-2-methylphenol (CAS#2835-95-2) and 1-naphthol (CAS#90-15-3). The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 3-aminophenol gives a magenta-brown dye, while the combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 1-naphthol gives a purple dye.\n*Yellow-green couplers include resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, and benzodioxoles. These compounds produce broad-band absorption when they react to form dyes, allowing for more natural-looking hair colors. The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler resorcinol gives a greenish brown dye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe first step shows the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine to the quinonediimine (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH)<sub>2</sub>):\n::[[File:Quinodiimine.png|200px]]\nThis species exists in equilibrium with the monoprotonated form (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH)(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup>) (not shown). The second step involves the attack of this quinonediimine on the coupler. In [[organic chemistry]], this reaction is called [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]:\n:[[File:Quinodiimine+Coupler.png|520px]]\nIn the third and final step, the product from the quinonediimine-coupler reaction oxidizes to the final hair dye.\n:[[File:QuinodiimineCouplerOx.png|520px]]\nIt was once believed that the dye forms in the above reaction bonds to hair permanently.<ref name=Ullmann>\"Hair Preparations,\" Ullmann\u2019s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry.

It is therefore considered semi-permanent to permanent, depending on a person's hair type. Most people will achieve a permanent color from henna, especially after the second dye. With repeated use the orange color builds up into red and then auburn. While \"natural\" henna is generally a red color, variations exist. These variations usually contain ingredients from other plants and even synthetic dyes.\n\nIndigo is natural dye from a plant (Indigofera tinctoria, suffructicosa, or arrecta) that can be added to henna or layered on top of it to create brown to black colors in the hair. Henna is orange, and indigo is blue, so as [[complementary colors|complementaries]] on a standard color wheel, the two colors' combined effect is to create brown tones. Like henna, indigo may fade after one application, but it becomes permanent on the hair with repeated use.\n\nUsing a plant-based color such as henna can cause problems later when trying to do a [[permanent wave|perm]] or permanent hair color. Some store-bought henna contains metallic salts which reacts to hydrogen peroxide that is used in hair lightening. This may lead to unpredictable results, such as green or blue tones in the hair. Henna is a healthy way to color hair, as long as no metallic salts are used.\n\nIn 2018, a system for making semi-permanent hair dyes from renewable waste [[blackcurrant]] (Ribes nigrum L.) fruit skins from the fruit pressing industry was developed. [[Anthocyanin]] pigments were extracted from the blackcurrant skin waste<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farooque|first1=Sannia|last2=Rose|first2=Paul M.|last3=Benohoud|first3=Meryem|last4=Blackburn|first4=Richard S.|last5=Rayner|first5=Christopher M.|year=2018|title=Enhancing the Potential Exploitation of Food Waste: Extraction, Purification, and Characterization of Renewable Specialty Chemicals from Blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum L.)|journal=J.

The modern trend is to use several colors to produce streaks or gradations, but not all work on top of a single base color. These are referred to as:\n\n* ''Highlighting'', where sections of hair are treated with lighteners\n* ''Lowlighting'', where sections of hair are treated with darker hair colors\n* ''Splashlighting'' a horizontal band of bleached hair from ear to ear\n\nThere are also newer coloring techniques such as ombr\u00e9, in which hair is dark on the crown and bit by bit becomes lighter toward the ends.\n\nThese are off-the-scalp techniques, and can be applied by the following methods:\n\n* ''Foiling'', where pieces of foil or plastic film are used to separate the hair to be colored, especially when applying more than one color (This ensures the color is applied only to the desired strands of hair, and protects the strands of hair not intended to be dyed.) \n* ''Cap'', when a plastic cap is placed tightly on the head and strands are pulled through with a hook (This method is not frequently practiced, with the exception of highlighting short hair.) \n* ''Balayage'', where hair color is painted directly onto sections of the hair with no foils used to keep the color contained (This method is growing in popularity because of its ability to look more natural.) The difference between balayage and ombr\u00e9 is that a balayage requires more precise hand-painting sections of hair and typically costs more. \n* ''[[Dip dye|Dipping or tip dyeing]]'', similar to balayage in that the color is painted directly on the hair (This results in a more solid level of coverage on the ends of the hair.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenio.com/664/dip-dye-hair-coloring-tutorial-and-styles|title=Dip-Dye Hair Coloring Tutorial and Styles|last=Wilson|first=Cynthia|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Womenio|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAll coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be [[bleach]]ed before coloring.\n\n===On-scalp===\nHair coloring can also be applied on the scalp for a more solid level of coverage \n* ''Root touch-up'', where color is applied only to the most recent section of re-growth (usually the first inch of hair nearest the scalp) Root touch-ups are repeated every 4\u20136 weeks as the natural color grows in and becomes apparent. People who color their hair to disguise gray often have these root touch-ups. \n* ''All-over color'', where the person wants all of their hair to be a different solid color \n* ''Block coloring'', where the person wants two or more colors applied to their hair, resulting in dimension and contrast\n\nAll coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair sometimes has to be [[bleach]]ed before coloring.\n\n==Types ==\nThe four most common classifications are ''permanent'', ''demi-permanent'' (sometimes called ''deposit only''), ''semi-permanent'', and ''temporary''.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n=== Permanent ===\nPermanent hair color generally contains ammonia and must be mixed with a developer or oxidizing agent in order to permanently change hair color. Ammonia is used in permanent hair color to open the [[cuticle]] layer so that the developer and colorants together can penetrate into the [[cortex (hair)|cortex]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Hair Color 101: Permanent Hair Color from Clairol Professional|url = http://www.clairolpro.com/inside-clairol-pro/permanent-hair-color|website = www.clairolpro.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}</ref> The developer, or oxidizing agent, comes in various volumes. The higher the developer volume, the higher the \"lift\" will be of a person's natural hair pigment. Someone with dark hair wishing to achieve two or three shades lighter may need a higher developer whereas someone with lighter hair wishing to achieve darker hair will not need one as high. Timing may vary with permanent hair coloring but is typically 30 minutes or 45 minutes for those wishing to achieve maximum color change.\n\n===Demi-permanent ===\n[[Half|Demi-permanent]] hair color is hair color that contains an alkaline agent other than ammonia (e.g. [[ethanolamine]], [[sodium carbonate]]) and, while always employed with a developer, the concentration of [[hydrogen peroxide]] in that developer may be lower than used with a permanent hair color. Since the alkaline agents employed in demi-permanent colors are less effective in removing the natural pigment of hair than ammonia these products provide no lightening of hair's color during dyeing. As the result, they cannot color hair to a lighter shade than it was before dyeing and are less damaging to hair than their permanent counterpart.\n\nDemi-permanents are much more effective at covering gray hair than semi-permanents, but less so than permanents.\n\nDemi-permanents have several advantages as compared with permanent color. Because there is essentially no lifting (i.e., removal) of natural hair color, the final color is less uniform/homogeneous than a permanent and therefore more natural looking; they are gentler on hair and therefore safer, especially for damaged hair; and they wash out over time (typically 20 to 28 shampoos), so root regrowth is less noticeable and if a change of color is desired, it is easier to achieve. Demi-permanent hair colors are not permanent but the darker shades in particular may persist longer than indicated on the packet.\n\n===Semi-permanent ===\n[[Semi-]]permanent hair coloring involves little or no developer, hydrogen peroxide or ammonia, and is thus less damaging to hair strands. The reduced amount of developer, whether peroxide or ammonia, means that hair previously damaged by applying permanent color or permanent reshaping is less likely to be damaged during the color application process.\n\nSemi-permanent hair color uses compounds of lower [[molecular weight]] than are found in temporary hair color dyes. These dyes penetrate the hair shaft only partially, because of the reduced amount of developer used. For this reason, the color will survive repeated washing, typically 4\u20135 shampoos or a few weeks, before undergoing significant fading or washing out entirely.\n\nSemi-permanents may still contain the suspected carcinogen [[p-phenylenediamine]] (PPD) or other related colorants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that in rats and mice chronically exposed to PPD in their diet, the PPT appears to simply depress body weight of the animals, with no other clinical signs of toxicity observed in several studies.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/phenylen.html p-Phenylenediamine], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ref>\n\nThe final color of each strand of hair will depend on its original color and porosity. Because hair's color and porosity across the head and along the length of a hair strand, there will be subtle variations in shade across the entire head. This gives a more natural-looking result than the solid, all over color of a permanent color. Because gray or white hairs have a different starting color than other hair, they will not appear as the same shade as the rest of the hair when treated with semi-permanent color. If there are only a few grey/white hairs, the effect will usually be enough for them to blend in, but as the gray spreads, there will come a point where it will not be disguised as well. In this case, the move to permanent color can sometimes be delayed by using the semi-permanent as a base and adding highlights.\n\nSemi-permanent color cannot lighten the hair.\n\n===Temporary color===\nTemporary hair color is available in various forms including rinses, shampoos, gels, sprays, and foams. Temporary hair color is typically brighter and more vibrant than semi-permanent and permanent hair color. It is most often used to color hair for special occasions such as costume parties and [[Halloween]].\n\nThe pigments in temporary hair color are high molecular weight and cannot penetrate the cuticle layer. The color particles remain [[wikt:adsorb|adsorbed]] (closely adherent) to the surface of the hair shaft and are easily removed with a single shampooing. Temporary hair color can persist on hair that is excessively dry or damaged in a way that allows for migration of the pigment to the interior of the hair shaft.\n\n===Alternative color===\n[[Image:Jeff-blue-beard-sized.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hair and beard colored blue]]\nAlternative hair coloring products are designed to create hair colors not typically found in nature. These are also referred to as \"vivid color\" in the hairstyling industry. The available colors are diverse, such as the colors green and fuchsia.\nPermanent alternatives in some colors are available. More recently, [[blacklight]]-reactive hair dyes have been brought to market that [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under blacklights, such as those often used at nightclubs.\n\nThe chemical formulae of alternative color dyes typically contain only tint and have no developer. This means that they will only create the bright color of the packet if they are applied to light blond hair. Darker hair (medium brown to black) would need to be bleached in order for these pigment applications to take to the hair desirably. Some types of fair hair may also take vivid colors more fully after bleaching. Gold, yellow and orange undertones in hair that has not been lightened enough can muddy the final hair color, especially with pink, [[Blue hair|blue]] and green dyes. Although some alternative colors are semi-permanent, such as blue and purple, it could take several months to fully wash the color from bleached or pre-lightened hair.\n\n== Maintaining hair color ==\nThere are many ways that people can maintain their hair color, such as:\n* Using color-protecting shampoos and conditioners\n* Using sulfate-free shampoo\n* Using purple shampoos and conditioners to maintain or enhance the blond color in their hair\n* Using leave-in treatments with UV absorbents\n* Getting deep-conditioning treatments to smooth and add luster \n* Avoiding chlorine\n* Using heat protecting products before using styling appliances\n\n== Adverse effects ==\nHair coloring involves the use of chemicals capable of removing, replacing, and/or covering up pigments naturally found inside the hair shaft. Use of these chemicals can result in a range of adverse effects, including temporary skin irritation and allergy, hair breakage, skin discoloration and unexpected hair color results. According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), in vitro and in vivo studies (in exposed human populations) have shown that some hair dyes and many chemicals used in the hair dyeing process can be considered [[mutagenic]] and [[carcinogenic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=1993|title=IARC working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans: occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers and personal use of hair colorants; some hair dyes, cosmetic colorants, industrial dyestuffs and aromatic amines.

Individuals allergic to gluten for example, will need to be cautious when purchasing hair color since certain hair dye includes gluten. Gluten does not need to be ingested for it to cause an allergy. Skin contact with gluten may cause a reaction; therefore, leading to an allergy. Symptoms of these reactions can include redness, sores, itching, burning sensation and discomfort. Symptoms will sometimes not be apparent immediately following the application and processing of the tint, but can also arise after hours or even a day later.\n\nTo help prevent or limit allergic reactions, the majority of hair color products recommend that the client conduct a [[patch test]] before using the product. This involves mixing a small quantity of tint preparation and applying it directly to the skin for a period of 48 hours. If irritation develops, manufacturers recommend that the client not use the product.\n\nEuropean dermatologists have, however, strongly advised against such pre-use testing, as it entails additional sensitisation (allergy) risk and the interpretation by lay people may not be sufficiently accurate.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.2012.02078.x |pmid=22568836 |title=Self-testing for contact sensitization to hair dyes - scientific considerations and clinical concerns of an industry-led screening programme |journal=Contact Dermatitis |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=300\u2013311 |year=2012 |last1=Thyssen |first1=Jacob P. |last2=S\u00f8sted |first2=Heidi |last3=Uter |first3=Wolfgang |last4=Schnuch |first4=Axel |last5=Gim\u00e9nez-Arnau |first5=Ana M. |last6=Vigan |first6=Martine |last7=Rustemeyer |first7=Thomas |last8=Granum |first8=Berit |last9=McFadden |first9=John |last10=White |first10=Jonathan M. |last11=White |first11=Ian R. |last12=Goossens |first12=Ann |last13=Menn\u00e9 |first13=Torkil |last14=Lid\u00e9n |first14=Carola |last15=Johansen |first15=Jeanne D. }}</ref>\n\n===Skin discoloration===\nSkin and fingernails are made of a similar type of keratinized protein as hair. That means that drips, slips and extra hair tint around the hairline can result in patches of discolored skin. This is more common with darker hair colors and persons with dry absorbent skin. That is why it is recommended that latex or nitrile gloves be worn to protect the hands.\n\nThis discoloration will disappear as the skin naturally renews itself and the top layer of skin is removed (typically takes a few days or at most a week). Ways of preventing skin discoloration are to wear latex or nitrile gloves to protect the hands and also by applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly or oil-based preparation around the hairline. Gentle abrasives such as moist baking soda or a small amount of toothpaste applied with a toothbrush may also help remove the uppermost layer of skin and dye (neither removes just the dye). Acetone and nail polish remover are not considered effective; laundry detergent may sometimes work as may moist cigarette ash rubbed into the stained area.<ref>Alexandra Tunell, [http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/advice/a4503/how-to-remove-hair-dye/ How to Get Hair Dye off Your Skin], Harper's Bazaar, Oct 2, 2016</ref>\n\n===Unintended results===\n{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}\nSeveral factors influence the final color of the hair following the coloring process.\n\n* For semi-permanent and demi-permanent color, the final color is a blend of the natural color of the hair and the dye color.\n* Bleached hair will often require pre-pigmentation before a color application. Dyeing bleached hair brown can result in grey or very ashy (grey sheen) hair.\n* Previously color treated hair can react unpredictably with subsequent color treatments.\n* Previous use of shampoos which deposit a layer of plastic on the hair can block the action of the dye.\n* Presence of minerals, salts, chlorine or other contaminants in the water used in the coloring process\n* Certain prescription drugs can alter hair chemistry\n* Coloring dark hair to achieve a desirable shade of blond requires bleaching, followed by a secondary color treatment. Bleached hair can still have a yellow or coppery shade. A violet-based color can cancel out yellow tones, and a blue-based shade will cancel out coppery orange.\n* Porosity of hair can affect the final shade. Porous hair often absorbs more color, which sometimes results darker than expected\n\n===Health concerns===\n* The salt [[lead acetate]] (the active ingredient in gradual darkening products such as [[Grecian formula]]) is toxic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/brands?tbl=brands&id=3022002|title=Household Products Database - Health and Safety Information on Household Products|website=hpd.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Riaz|first1=Almas|title=Shampoo for color treated hair|url=http://www.tuneyourhair.com/best-shampoo-for-color-treated-hair/|website=Tune Your Hair|publisher=The Hair Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Tukker |first1=Arnold |last2=Buijst |first2=Harrie |last3=Van Oers |first3=Lauren |last4=Van Der Voet |first4=Ester |title=Risks to Health and the Environment Related to the Use of Lead in Products |year=2001 |url=http://www.dphu.org/uploads/attachements/books/books_760_0.pdf }}</ref> Lead acetate trihydrate has also been shown to cause reproductive toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=James|title=Reproductive toxicology.

The process is typically performed under basic conditions. The mechanism of oxidation dyes involves three steps:<ref name=Ullmann/>\n1) Oxidation of 1,4-diaminobenzene derivative to the quinone state.\n2) Reaction of this diimine with a coupler compound (more detail below).\n3) Oxidation of the resulting compound to give the final dye.\n\nThe preparation (dye precursors) is in the leuco (colorless) form. Oxidizing agents are usually [[hydrogen peroxide]], and the alkaline environment is usually provided by ammonia. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia causes the natural hair to be lightened, providing a \"blank canvas\" for the dye. Ammonia opens the hair shaft pores so that the dye can actually diffuse inside the fiber. These dye intermediates and coupler compounds can undergo oxidation and coupling reaction as shown in the scheme below to form high molecular weight products, which are trapped in the hair matrix and cannot be readily removed through washing.\n\nVarious combinations of primary intermediates and coupler compounds provide a spectrum of shades of hair colors. The primary intermediates are aromatic para compounds, such as 1,4-diaminobenzene or 4-aminophenol. The coupler compounds (couplers) are meta-substituted derivatives of [[aniline]]. They come in three major classes based on the color that they produce when they react with the primary intermediate.\n\n:[[File:HairChemicals.svg|thumb|720px|center|Couplers are chemical compounds that define the color of the hair dye. Shown here are three red couplers (A, B, C), two yellow-green couplers (D, E) and a blue coupler (F).]]\n*Blue couplers include [[1,3-Diaminobenzene|1,3-diaminobenzene]] and its derivatives.\n*Red couplers include phenols and naphthols, such as 3-aminophenol (CAS#591-27-5), 5-amino-2-methylphenol (CAS#2835-95-2) and 1-naphthol (CAS#90-15-3). The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 3-aminophenol gives a magenta-brown dye, while the combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 1-naphthol gives a purple dye.\n*Yellow-green couplers include resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, and benzodioxoles. These compounds produce broad-band absorption when they react to form dyes, allowing for more natural-looking hair colors. The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler resorcinol gives a greenish brown dye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe first step shows the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine to the quinonediimine (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH)<sub>2</sub>):\n::[[File:Quinodiimine.png|200px]]\nThis species exists in equilibrium with the monoprotonated form (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH)(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup>) (not shown). The second step involves the attack of this quinonediimine on the coupler. In [[organic chemistry]], this reaction is called [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]:\n:[[File:Quinodiimine+Coupler.png|520px]]\nIn the third and final step, the product from the quinonediimine-coupler reaction oxidizes to the final hair dye.\n:[[File:QuinodiimineCouplerOx.png|520px]]\nIt was once believed that the dye forms in the above reaction bonds to hair permanently.<ref name=Ullmann>\"Hair Preparations,\" Ullmann\u2019s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2006). {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_571.pub2}}</ref> It was later shown that the main reason that this reaction imparts a permanent color on hair by producing larger dye molecules, which is locked inside the hair.<ref>Alexander Chan, Sean Kung, (September, 2006), \"Hair Colorant Technology Advances Further\", ''Personal Care'', p. 11-16</ref>\n\n==Plant-based dyes==\n[[Henna]] is an orange dye commonly used as a deposit-only hair color whose active component, [[lawsone]], binds to [[keratin]]. It is therefore considered semi-permanent to permanent, depending on a person's hair type. Most people will achieve a permanent color from henna, especially after the second dye. With repeated use the orange color builds up into red and then auburn. While \"natural\" henna is generally a red color, variations exist. These variations usually contain ingredients from other plants and even synthetic dyes.\n\nIndigo is natural dye from a plant (Indigofera tinctoria, suffructicosa, or arrecta) that can be added to henna or layered on top of it to create brown to black colors in the hair. Henna is orange, and indigo is blue, so as [[complementary colors|complementaries]] on a standard color wheel, the two colors' combined effect is to create brown tones. Like henna, indigo may fade after one application, but it becomes permanent on the hair with repeated use.\n\nUsing a plant-based color such as henna can cause problems later when trying to do a [[permanent wave|perm]] or permanent hair color. Some store-bought henna contains metallic salts which reacts to hydrogen peroxide that is used in hair lightening. This may lead to unpredictable results, such as green or blue tones in the hair. Henna is a healthy way to color hair, as long as no metallic salts are used.\n\nIn 2018, a system for making semi-permanent hair dyes from renewable waste [[blackcurrant]] (Ribes nigrum L.) fruit skins from the fruit pressing industry was developed. [[Anthocyanin]] pigments were extracted from the blackcurrant skin waste<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farooque|first1=Sannia|last2=Rose|first2=Paul M.|last3=Benohoud|first3=Meryem|last4=Blackburn|first4=Richard S.|last5=Rayner|first5=Christopher M.|year=2018|title=Enhancing the Potential Exploitation of Food Waste: Extraction, Purification, and Characterization of Renewable Specialty Chemicals from Blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum L.)|journal=J.

Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Sandcastles]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama. I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros, I like my negro nose with [[The Jackson 5|Jackson Five]] nostrils.

Lord, forgive me, I've been running, running blind in truth\"), [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] (\"I'ma wade, I'ma [[Wade in the Water|wave through the waters]]\"), and [[Black Lives Matter]] (\"I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders, call me bulletproof\"). [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day. It was released for [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] on May 6, 2016.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Sandcastles]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama. I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros, I like my negro nose with [[The Jackson 5|Jackson Five]] nostrils.

Lord, forgive me, I've been running, running blind in truth\"), [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] (\"I'ma wade, I'ma [[Wade in the Water|wave through the waters]]\"), and [[Black Lives Matter]] (\"I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders, call me bulletproof\"). [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]], although the exact origin and timing of the [[evolution of dinosaurs]] is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&nbsp;million years ago; their dominance continued through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record demonstrates that [[bird]]s are modern [[feathered dinosaur]]s, having [[Evolution of birds|evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs''', or birds; and '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.\n\nDinosaurs are a varied group of animals from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecology|ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living [[species]], are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology#Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], others [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[Oviparity|egg-laying]]; and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many [[extinction|extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeleton|skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied\u2014the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized.

The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.

In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=2019-08-31 |access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nResearch by Matthew G.

Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor.

However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group [[Archosaur]]ia, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups.

Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian [[ornithischia]]ns and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. Dinosaurs in [[China]] show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but [[Plateosauridae|prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.<ref name=KP04/>\n[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus|Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[Avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]\nBy the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass.

These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]].<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores.

Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.<ref name=\"B012\"/>\n\nCollectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all [[taxon|taxa]] sharing a more recent common ancestor with ''Triceratops'' than with Saurischia.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodile]]s (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<ref name=alexander2006/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''[[Iguanodon|Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]\nThe crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''Microraptor''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]\nModern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\nThe earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/> though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Currie|Padian|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopediaOfDinosaurs/page/n235 206]|loc=\"Eggs, Eggshells, and Nests\" by Konstantin E.

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor & Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564\u2013576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs.

A discovery of features in a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n\n[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=PW88/> Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[Lagerst\u00e4tten|lagerst\u00e4tte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.<ref name=\"Schweitzeretal1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Watt |first2=J.A. |last3=Avci |first3=R. |last4=Knapp |first4=L. |last5=Chiappe |first5=L. |last6=Norell |first6=M. |last7=Marshall |first7=M. |display-authors=3 |date=August 15, 1999 |title=Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous Alvarezsaurid, ''Shuvuuia deserti'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology|Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=285 |issue=2 |pages=146\u2013157 |pmid=10440726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990815)285:2<146::AID-JEZ7>3.0.CO;2-A |issn=1552-5007}}</ref>\n\nThe description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,<ref name=TLS03/><ref name=FLH05/><ref name=LSFX07/> and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.<ref name=AF02/><ref name=FLH05/> However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.<ref name=Prum2003/>\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in [[amber]].

Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Douglas S. |last2=McKenna |first2=Malcolm C. |author2-link=Malcolm McKenna |last3=Toon |first3=Owen B. |author3-link=Owen Toon |last4=Hope |first4=Sylvia |last5=Lillegraven |first5=Jason A. |display-authors=3 |date=May\u2013June 2004 |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |volume=116 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=760\u2013768 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |issn=0016-7606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-18 |access-date=2011-06-15}}</ref> In 2019, scientists drilling into the seafloor off Mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a city-sized asteroid smashed into the planet.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |date=September 15, 2019 |title=Details Discovered About the Day the Dinosaurs Died |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |url-status=live |department=News |work=[[MSN|MSN.com]] |location=[[Redmond, Washington|Redmond, WA]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918064400/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |archive-date=2019-09-18 |access-date=2019-11-08}}\n*{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |author-mask=2 |date=September 9, 2019 |title=Scientists Discover New Evidence of the Asteroid That Killed Off the Dinosaurs |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |issn=0099-9660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108144546/https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |archive-date=2019-11-08 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] -->\n{{Main|Deccan Traps}}\n\nBefore 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;million years ago and lasted for over 2&nbsp;million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1&nbsp;million years about 66&nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe Deccan Traps in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name=Duncan/> Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the Deccan Traps \"contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of [{{convert|8|C-change|F-change}}] in the last half-million years before the impact [at Chicxulub].\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=What Really Killed the Dinosaurs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dino_trans.shtml |access-date=2019-11-11 |series=[[Horizon (British TV series)|Horizon]] |last=Fortune |first=Jack (narrator) |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=October 7, 2004 |series-no=41 |number=4}}</ref><ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nIn the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by [[Signor\u2013Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref name=Alvarez1997/>\n\n===Possible Paleocene survivors===\n{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}\nNon-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]]. In 2000, paleontologist [[Spencer G. Lucas]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] right femur in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[New Mexico]], and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5&nbsp;million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half-million years into the Cenozoic.<ref name=Fassett/> Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.<ref name=Sloan/> Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name=FS05/><ref name=Sullivan/> Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with [[uranium\u2013lead dating]] methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 \u00b1 0.9&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=fassettetall2011/> If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.<ref name=FS05/>\n\n==History of study==\n{{Further|History of paleontology}}\nDinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] bones and documented them as such.

Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a ''Megalosaurus'',<ref name=WAS97/> was recovered from a limestone quarry at [[Cornwell, Oxfordshire|Cornwell]] near [[Chipping Norton]], Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''The Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (1677).<ref>{{harvnb|Plot|1677}}</ref> He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species.

Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.<ref name=GM25/><ref name=HDS97/>\n\nThe study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<ref name=owen94>{{harvnb|Rupke|1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201398 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-22 |access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image\n|width=130\n|image1=Edcope.jpg|caption1=[[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n|image2=OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|caption2=[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]}}\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because the explosions from the dynamic would potentially destroy any and all dinosauric evidence). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nAfter 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including Antarctica.

[[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]]. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the well-preserved feathered dinosaurs<ref name=\"NYT-20161208\" /> in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of [[cladistics]], which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs.

Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]\nOne of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the [[Pietraroja Formation|Pietraroia Plattenkalk]] in southern [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, ''[[Scipionyx|Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<ref name=\"softtissue\" />\n\nIn the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/> When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[Osteon|bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/>\n\nIn 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosauridae|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus|Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was [[collagen]], as in the ''Tyrannosaurus'' bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its [[DNA]] and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |url-status=dead |title=Blood, tissue extracted from duck-billed dinosaur bone |last=Evershed |first=Nick |date=May 1, 2009 |website=[[Cosmos (Australian magazine)|Cosmos Online]] |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=[[Adelaide]] |issn=1832-522X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215044640/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |archive-date=2016-02-15 |access-date=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions;<ref name=bone>{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Wenxia |first2=Zheng |last3=Cleland |first3=Timothy P. |last4=Bern |first4=Marshall |display-authors=3 |date=January 2013 |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=[[Bone (journal)|Bone]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414\u2013423 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010 |issn=8756-3282 |pmid=23085295}}</ref> upon further inspection and [[peer review]], however, neither of these reports could be confirmed.<ref name=Wangetal1997/> However, a functional [[peptide]] involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.<ref name=changetal2002/> In addition, several [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]],<ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/> have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.<ref name=Emberyatal2003/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Joseph E. |last2=Lenczewski |first2=Melissa E. |last3=Scherer |first3=Reed P. |date=October 12, 2010 |editor-last=Stepanova |editor-first=Anna |title=Influence of Microbial Biofilms on the Preservation of Primary Soft Tissue in Fossil and Extant Archosaurs |journal=PLOS ONE |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=PLOS |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=e13334 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...513334P |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013334 |doi-access=free |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=2953520 |pmid=20967227}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertazzo |first1=Sergio |last2=Maidment |first2=Susannah C.R. |author2-link=Susannah Maidment |last3=Kallepitis |first3=Charalambos |last4=Fearn |first4=Sarah |last5=Stevens |first5=Molly M. |last6=Xie |first6=Hai-nan |display-authors=3 |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million-year-old dinosaur specimens |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |location=London |publisher=Nature Research |volume=6 |page=7352 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6.7352B |doi=10.1038/ncomms8352 |issn=2041-1723 |pmc=4468865 |pmid=26056764}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mortillaro |first=Nicole |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Scientists discover 75-million-year-old dinosaur blood and tissue |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |url-status=live |work=[[Global News]] |location=[[Toronto]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611144652/https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |archive-date=2019-06-11 |access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''Iguanodon'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]\n[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture]]\nBy human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general.

They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]], although the exact origin and timing of the [[evolution of dinosaurs]] is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&nbsp;million years ago; their dominance continued through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record demonstrates that [[bird]]s are modern [[feathered dinosaur]]s, having [[Evolution of birds|evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs''', or birds; and '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.\n\nDinosaurs are a varied group of animals from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecology|ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living [[species]], are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology#Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], others [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[Oviparity|egg-laying]]; and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many [[extinction|extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeleton|skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied\u2014the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nSince the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[taxon]] 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1842 by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the \"distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles\" that were then being recognized in [[England]] and around the world.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref>{{cite Merriam-Webster|Dinosauria|accessdate=2019-11-10}}</ref> The term is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2]]'' (deinos)|terrible, potent or fearfully great||''[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (sauros)|lizard or reptile}}.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref name=LSJ/> Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.<ref name=FBS97/>\n\nOther prehistoric animals, including [[pterosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |url-status=live |title=Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs And Other Saurs \u2013 Big Differences |last=Chamary |first=JV |date=September 30, 2014 |website=[[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]] |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |location=[[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]] |issn=0015-6914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110172257/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |archive-date=2014-11-10 |access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref> Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade [[Avemetatarsalia|Ornithodira]]. The other groups mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of [[Sauropsida]] (the reptile and bird clade), except ''Dimetrodon'' (which is a [[synapsid]]).\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:LA-Triceratops mount-2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]]]]\nUnder [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and [[Bird#Diversification of modern birds|modern birds]] (Neornithes), and all its descendants.<ref name=MJB04dino/> It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.<ref name=olshevsky2000/> Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: \"Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]\", encompassing [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]]s (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including \"[[Hadrosauridae|duck-bills]]\"), theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).<ref name=\"Letal05\"/>\n\nBirds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=2019-08-31 |access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nResearch by Matthew G. Baron, [[David B. Norman]], and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron ''et al.'' recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the [[Theropoda]] than the [[Sauropodomorpha]], as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade [[Ornithoscelida]] to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of ''[[Triceratops|Triceratops horridus]]'', ''[[house sparrow|Passer domesticus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'', and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"NYT-20170322\">{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Wade |title=Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree |date=March 22, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |url-status=live |url-access=registration |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407234942/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |archive-date=2018-04-07 |access-date=2019-10-30}} \"A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree.\"</ref><ref name=\"NAT-20170322\">{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=Matthew G. |last2=Norman |first2=David B. |author-link2=David B.

While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''Iguanodon'', could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the [[Early Jurassic]] epoch.<ref name=MacLeod/> Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as ''[[Microraptor]]'') could fly or at least glide, and others, such as [[spinosauridae|spinosaurids]], had [[list of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] habits.<ref name=theropods/>\n\n===Distinguishing anatomical features===\nWhile recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral [[archosaur]]ian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the [[Synapomorphy and apomorphy|synapomorphies]] of such a group.<ref name=\"B012\"/>\n\nA detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by [[Sterling Nesbitt]]<ref name=nesbitt2011/> confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known:\n* in the [[skull]], a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the [[Skull#Structure|supratemporal fenestra]], the main opening in the rear skull roof\n* [[epipophyses]], obliquely backward-pointing processes on the rear top corners, present in the anterior (front) neck [[vertebra]]e behind the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]], the first two neck vertebrae\n* apex of deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the [[clavipectoral triangle|deltopectoral]] muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone)\n* [[Radius (bone)|radius]], a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length\n* [[fourth trochanter]] (projection where the [[caudofemoralis]] muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft) on the [[femur]] (thigh bone) is a sharp flange\n* fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal, lower, margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft\n* on the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]], upper ankle bones, the proximal articular facet, the top connecting surface, for the [[fibula]] occupies less than 30% of the transverse width of the element\n* exoccipitals (bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity, the inner space of the braincase\n* in the pelvis, the proximal articular surfaces of the [[ischium]] with the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] are separated by a large concave surface (on the upper side of the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contacts with the pubic bone and the ilium)\n* [[cnemial crest]] on the [[tibia]] (protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone) arcs anterolaterally (curves to the front and the outer side)\n* distinct proximodistally oriented (vertical) ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia (the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone)\n* concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum (the top surface of the calcaneum, where it touches the fibula, has a hollow profile)\n\nNesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<ref name=MJB04dino/>\n[[File:Skull diapsida 1.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a typical [[diapsid]] skull<br />j: [[jugal bone]], po: [[postorbital bone]], p: [[parietal bone]], sq: [[squamosal bone]], q: [[quadrate bone]], qj: [[quadratojugal bone]]]]\nA variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group [[Archosaur]]ia, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated [[scapula]], or shoulder blade; a [[sacrum]] composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'');<ref name=MJB04dino/> and a [[Acetabulum#Perforate Acetabulum|perforate acetabulum]], or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in ''[[Saturnalia tupiniquim]]'', for example).<ref name=\"UC Berkeley Journal of Earth Sciences\">{{cite web |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/dinomm.html |last1=Smith |first1=Dave |display-authors=et al. |title=Dinosauria: Morphology |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley |access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref name=LARB99/> Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the [[Late Triassic]] epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.<ref name=NIP07/>\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures of: (left to right) typical [[reptile]]s (sprawling), dinosaurs and [[mammal]]s (erect), and [[rauisuchia]]ns (pillar-erect)]]\nDinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to [[Evolution of mammals#Erect limbs|most modern mammals]], but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.<ref name=Holland1909/> This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.<ref name=MJB00/> Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that [[Carrier's constraint|surpassed those of \"sprawling\" reptiles]].<ref name=RC05/> Erect limbs probably also helped support the [[evolution]] of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.<ref name=TKMB07/> Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including [[rauisuchia]]ns, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a \"pillar-erect\" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the [[ilium (bone)|upper pelvic bone]] was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.<ref name=TKMB07/>\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n{{Main|Evolution of dinosaurs}}\n\n===Origins and early evolution===\nDinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the Middle to Late Triassic epochs, roughly 20&nbsp;million years after the devastating [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species approximately 252 million years ago.<ref name=KPA/><ref name=TannerLucas/> [[Radiometric dating]] of the [[List of rock formations|rock formation]] that contained fossils from the early dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Eoraptor]]'' at 231.4&nbsp;million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.<ref name=\"OARM2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Alcober |first1=Oscar A.|last2=Martinez |first2=Ricardo N. |date=October 19, 2010 |title=A new herrerasaurid (Dinosauria, Saurischia) from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |location=[[Sofia]] |publisher=[[Pensoft Publishers]] |issue=63 |pages=55\u201381 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.63.550 |pmc=3088398 |issn=1313-2989 |pmid=21594020}}</ref> Paleontologists think that ''Eoraptor'' resembles the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all dinosaurs;<ref name=Sereno1999/> if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal [[predation|predators]].<ref name=SFRM93/> The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as ''[[Marasuchus]]'' and ''[[Lagerpeton]]'' in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Middle Triassic]] strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.<ref name=HCL04/> [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s), a potential food source, [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] in the Late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian [[ornithischia]]ns and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. Dinosaurs in [[China]] show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but [[Plateosauridae|prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.<ref name=KP04/>\n[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus|Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[Avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]\nBy the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through [[Europe]], North America, and northern [[Africa]]. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]].<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodile]]s (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<ref name=alexander2006/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''[[Iguanodon|Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]\nThe crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''Microraptor''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]\nModern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\nThe earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/> though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Currie|Padian|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopediaOfDinosaurs/page/n235 206]|loc=\"Eggs, Eggshells, and Nests\" by Konstantin E.

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor & Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564\u2013576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs.

Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n\n[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=PW88/> Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[Lagerst\u00e4tten|lagerst\u00e4tte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.<ref name=\"Schweitzeretal1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Watt |first2=J.A. |last3=Avci |first3=R. |last4=Knapp |first4=L. |last5=Chiappe |first5=L. |last6=Norell |first6=M. |last7=Marshall |first7=M. |display-authors=3 |date=August 15, 1999 |title=Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous Alvarezsaurid, ''Shuvuuia deserti'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology|Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=285 |issue=2 |pages=146\u2013157 |pmid=10440726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990815)285:2<146::AID-JEZ7>3.0.CO;2-A |issn=1552-5007}}</ref>\n\nThe description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,<ref name=TLS03/><ref name=FLH05/><ref name=LSFX07/> and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.<ref name=AF02/><ref name=FLH05/> However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.<ref name=Prum2003/>\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in [[amber]].

Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Douglas S. |last2=McKenna |first2=Malcolm C. |author2-link=Malcolm McKenna |last3=Toon |first3=Owen B. |author3-link=Owen Toon |last4=Hope |first4=Sylvia |last5=Lillegraven |first5=Jason A. |display-authors=3 |date=May\u2013June 2004 |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |volume=116 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=760\u2013768 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |issn=0016-7606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-18 |access-date=2011-06-15}}</ref> In 2019, scientists drilling into the seafloor off Mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a city-sized asteroid smashed into the planet.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |date=September 15, 2019 |title=Details Discovered About the Day the Dinosaurs Died |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |url-status=live |department=News |work=[[MSN|MSN.com]] |location=[[Redmond, Washington|Redmond, WA]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918064400/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |archive-date=2019-09-18 |access-date=2019-11-08}}\n*{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |author-mask=2 |date=September 9, 2019 |title=Scientists Discover New Evidence of the Asteroid That Killed Off the Dinosaurs |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |issn=0099-9660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108144546/https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |archive-date=2019-11-08 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] -->\n{{Main|Deccan Traps}}\n\nBefore 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;million years ago and lasted for over 2&nbsp;million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1&nbsp;million years about 66&nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe Deccan Traps in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name=Duncan/> Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the Deccan Traps \"contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of [{{convert|8|C-change|F-change}}] in the last half-million years before the impact [at Chicxulub].\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=What Really Killed the Dinosaurs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dino_trans.shtml |access-date=2019-11-11 |series=[[Horizon (British TV series)|Horizon]] |last=Fortune |first=Jack (narrator) |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=October 7, 2004 |series-no=41 |number=4}}</ref><ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nIn the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by [[Signor\u2013Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref name=Alvarez1997/>\n\n===Possible Paleocene survivors===\n{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}\nNon-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]]. In 2000, paleontologist [[Spencer G. Lucas]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] right femur in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[New Mexico]], and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5&nbsp;million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half-million years into the Cenozoic.<ref name=Fassett/> Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.<ref name=Sloan/> Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name=FS05/><ref name=Sullivan/> Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with [[uranium\u2013lead dating]] methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 \u00b1 0.9&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=fassettetall2011/> If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.<ref name=FS05/>\n\n==History of study==\n{{Further|History of paleontology}}\nDinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] bones and documented them as such.

Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a ''Megalosaurus'',<ref name=WAS97/> was recovered from a limestone quarry at [[Cornwell, Oxfordshire|Cornwell]] near [[Chipping Norton]], Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''The Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (1677).<ref>{{harvnb|Plot|1677}}</ref> He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species.

Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.<ref name=GM25/><ref name=HDS97/>\n\nThe study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<ref name=owen94>{{harvnb|Rupke|1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201398 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-22 |access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image\n|width=130\n|image1=Edcope.jpg|caption1=[[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n|image2=OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|caption2=[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]}}\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because the explosions from the dynamic would potentially destroy any and all dinosauric evidence). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nAfter 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including Antarctica.

[[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]]. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the well-preserved feathered dinosaurs<ref name=\"NYT-20161208\" /> in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of [[cladistics]], which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs.

Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]\nOne of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the [[Pietraroja Formation|Pietraroia Plattenkalk]] in southern [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, ''[[Scipionyx|Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<ref name=\"softtissue\" />\n\nIn the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/> When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[Osteon|bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/>\n\nIn 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosauridae|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus|Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was [[collagen]], as in the ''Tyrannosaurus'' bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its [[DNA]] and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |url-status=dead |title=Blood, tissue extracted from duck-billed dinosaur bone |last=Evershed |first=Nick |date=May 1, 2009 |website=[[Cosmos (Australian magazine)|Cosmos Online]] |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=[[Adelaide]] |issn=1832-522X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215044640/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |archive-date=2016-02-15 |access-date=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions;<ref name=bone>{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Wenxia |first2=Zheng |last3=Cleland |first3=Timothy P. |last4=Bern |first4=Marshall |display-authors=3 |date=January 2013 |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=[[Bone (journal)|Bone]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414\u2013423 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010 |issn=8756-3282 |pmid=23085295}}</ref> upon further inspection and [[peer review]], however, neither of these reports could be confirmed.<ref name=Wangetal1997/> However, a functional [[peptide]] involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.<ref name=changetal2002/> In addition, several [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]],<ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/> have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.<ref name=Emberyatal2003/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Joseph E. |last2=Lenczewski |first2=Melissa E. |last3=Scherer |first3=Reed P. |date=October 12, 2010 |editor-last=Stepanova |editor-first=Anna |title=Influence of Microbial Biofilms on the Preservation of Primary Soft Tissue in Fossil and Extant Archosaurs |journal=PLOS ONE |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=PLOS |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=e13334 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...513334P |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013334 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=2953520 |pmid=20967227}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertazzo |first1=Sergio |last2=Maidment |first2=Susannah C.R. |author2-link=Susannah Maidment |last3=Kallepitis |first3=Charalambos |last4=Fearn |first4=Sarah |last5=Stevens |first5=Molly M. |last6=Xie |first6=Hai-nan |display-authors=3 |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million-year-old dinosaur specimens |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |location=London |publisher=Nature Research |volume=6 |page=7352 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6.7352B |doi=10.1038/ncomms8352 |issn=2041-1723 |pmc=4468865 |pmid=26056764}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mortillaro |first=Nicole |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Scientists discover 75-million-year-old dinosaur blood and tissue |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |url-status=live |work=[[Global News]] |location=[[Toronto]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611144652/https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |archive-date=2019-06-11 |access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''Iguanodon'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]\n[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture]]\nBy human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general.

{"title_page": "Christian views on magic", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n{{original research|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n{{short description|Christian views on magic}}\n\n'''Christian views on magick''' vary widely among [[Christian denomination|denominations]] and among individuals. Most [[Christians]] actively condemn any form of [[Magick (paranormal)|magick]] as [[satan]]ic, holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magickal practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning \"to whisper\". Strong therefore concludes that the word means \"to whisper a spell, ''i.e.'' to [[Incantation|incant]] or practice magic\". The [[Contemporary English Version]] translates {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11|CEV}} as referring to \"any kind of magic\".\n\nAt the very least, older biblical prohibitions included those against '[[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]]' to obtain something unnaturally; '[[necromancy]]' as the practice of magic or divination through demons or the dead; and any forms of malevolent '[[bewitchery]]'.\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] includes sorcery in a list of \"works of the flesh\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:19-21}}</ref> This disapproval is echoed in the ''[[Didache]]'',<ref name=Didache>{{cite book|title=Teaching of the twelve Apostles, tr. from the 'editio princeps' of Bryennios, by A.

Among [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] concentrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as ''deisidaimonia''\u2014[[superstition]]\u2014and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the [[Western Christianity|Latin Christian West]], belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as [[heresy]].\n\nChristian perspectives began to change with the influential writings of mystic poet [[Dante Alighieri]] and scholastic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]], both of whom believed in [[astrology]], whilst condemning [[wikt:sorcery|sorcery]] as moral perversion.<ref>Tarrant, Neil \"Between Aquinas and Eymerich: The Roman Inquisition\u2019s Use of Dominican Thought in the Censorship of Alchemy\" Pages 210-231 | Published online: 22 Aug 2018</ref> [[Dante]] also condemned then current forms of [[alchemy]] and [[divination]], whilst [[Aquinas]] had a more nuanced and sympathetic view.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[early modern period]] (post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]. This marked the beginning of a period of [[witch hunt]]s among early [[Protestantism|Protestants]] which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, tens of thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Brian P.

For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were ''not'' to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, [[Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas]], in charge of the subsequent investigation. The results of Salazar's investigation was that the Spanish Inquisition did not bother witches ever again though they still went after heretics and [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]].<ref>1978 \"A witch with three toes too many\"; Out of this World Encyclopedia 23:9-12</ref>\n\n===Martin Luther===\n[[Martin Luther]] shared some of the views about witchcraft that were common in his time.<ref>{{cite book\n | first1 = Susan C. | last1 = Karant-Nunn\n | first2 = Merry E. | last2=  Wiesner-Hanks\n | title = Luther on Women: A Sourcebook | location = Cambridge | publisher =  Cambridge U.

Both bourgeoisie and nobility of that era showed great fascination with these arts, which exerted an [[exoticism|exotic charm]] by their ascription to Arabic, Jewish, Romani, and Egyptian sources. There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The people during this time found that the existence of magic was something that could answer the questions that they could not explain through science. To them it was suggesting that while science may explain reason, magic could explain \"unreason\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dawes|first=Gregory|date=|title=The Rationality of Renaissance Magic|journal=Paregon|volume=30|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Marsilio Ficino]] advocated the existence of spiritual beings and spirits in general, though many such theories ran counter to the ideas of the later [[Age of Enlightenment]], and were treated with hostility by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological\u2014that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995. Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery, in Missionalia, Vol. 23(3) November.

These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice from a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian perspectives, as for example in [[Christian Wicca]] or in some [[Gaianism|Gaian 'Goddess' communities]]. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the [[Curandero|''curanderismo'']] practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Evelyn Underhill]] - Anglican mystic, member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n*[[Arthur Machen]] - Anglican writer, member of the HOGD\n*[[Charles_Williams_(British_writer)|Charles Williams]] - Anglican theologian, mystic, member of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].\n*[[Robert Felkin]] - Anglican missionary, ceremonical magician and occult writer, chief of the [[Stella Matutina]]\n*Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] - Author and \"[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualist]]\"\n*[[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Rose Cross]]\n* [[Thomas Ady]]\n* [[Benedicaria]]\n* [[Christianity and neopaganism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christian Kabbalah]]\n* [[Christian views on astrology]]\n* [[Christian views on Freemasonry]]\n* ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark''\n* ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''\n*[[Enochian magic]]\n* [[Esoteric Christianity]]\n* [[Folk Catholicism]]\n* [[Folk religion#Folk Christianity|Folk Christianity]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''\n* [[Nehushtan]]\n* [[Anton Praetorius]]\n* ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]''\n* ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]''\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Cohn\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Europe's inner demons\n  | publisher = Sussex University Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = London\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-435-82183-0 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Fox\n  | first = Robin Lane\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pagans and Christians\n  | publisher = Knopf\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-394-55495-7 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Hutton\n  | first = Ronald\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Pagan religions of the ancient British Isles\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Oxford\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780631172888\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 0-631-17288-2\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Charles\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Witchcraft\n  | publisher = Meridian\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n''Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power'' by Marvin W.

Most [[Christians]] actively condemn any form of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as [[satan]]ic, holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magical practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning \"to whisper\". Strong therefore concludes that the word means \"to whisper a spell, ''i.e.'' to [[Incantation|incant]] or practice magic\". The [[Contemporary English Version]] translates {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11|CEV}} as referring to \"any kind of magic\".\n\nAt the very least, older biblical prohibitions included those against '[[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]]' to obtain something unnaturally; '[[necromancy]]' as the practice of magic or divination through demons or the dead; and any forms of malevolent '[[bewitchery]]'.\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] includes sorcery in a list of \"works of the flesh\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:19-21}}</ref> This disapproval is echoed in the ''[[Didache]]'',<ref name=Didache>{{cite book|title=Teaching of the twelve Apostles, tr. from the 'editio princeps' of Bryennios, by A.

Among [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] concentrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as ''deisidaimonia''\u2014[[superstition]]\u2014and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the [[Western Christianity|Latin Christian West]], belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as [[heresy]].\n\nChristian perspectives began to change with the influential writings of mystic poet [[Dante Alighieri]] and scholastic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]], both of whom believed in [[astrology]], whilst condemning [[wikt:sorcery|sorcery]] as moral perversion.<ref>Tarrant, Neil \"Between Aquinas and Eymerich: The Roman Inquisition\u2019s Use of Dominican Thought in the Censorship of Alchemy\" Pages 210-231 | Published online: 22 Aug 2018</ref> [[Dante]] also condemned then current forms of [[alchemy]] and [[divination]], whilst [[Aquinas]] had a more nuanced and sympathetic view.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[early modern period]] (post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]. This marked the beginning of a period of [[witch hunt]]s among early [[Protestantism|Protestants]] which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, tens of thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Brian P.

For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were ''not'' to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, [[Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas]], in charge of the subsequent investigation.

But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological\u2014that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995. Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery, in Missionalia, Vol. 23(3) November. Pages 339-354.  {{cite web |url=http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415185117/http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM |archivedate=2007-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nThe situation was further complicated by the rise of [[new religious movements]] that considered witchcraft to be a religion. These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice from a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian perspectives, as for example in [[Christian Wicca]] or in some [[Gaianism|Gaian 'Goddess' communities]]. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the [[Curandero|''curanderismo'']] practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Evelyn Underhill]] - Anglican mystic, member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n*[[Arthur Machen]] - Anglican writer, member of the HOGD\n*[[Charles_Williams_(British_writer)|Charles Williams]] - Anglican theologian, mystic, member of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].\n*[[Robert Felkin]] - Anglican missionary, ceremonical magician and occult writer, chief of the [[Stella Matutina]]\n*Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] - Author and \"[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualist]]\"\n*[[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Rose Cross]]\n* [[Thomas Ady]]\n* [[Benedicaria]]\n* [[Christianity and neopaganism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christian Kabbalah]]\n* [[Christian views on astrology]]\n* [[Christian views on Freemasonry]]\n* ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark''\n* ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''\n*[[Enochian magic]]\n* [[Esoteric Christianity]]\n* [[Folk Catholicism]]\n* [[Folk religion#Folk Christianity|Folk Christianity]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''\n* [[Nehushtan]]\n* [[Anton Praetorius]]\n* ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]''\n* ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]''\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Cohn\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Europe's inner demons\n  | publisher = Sussex University Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = London\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-435-82183-0 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Fox\n  | first = Robin Lane\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pagans and Christians\n  | publisher = Knopf\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-394-55495-7 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Hutton\n  | first = Ronald\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Pagan religions of the ancient British Isles\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Oxford\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780631172888\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 0-631-17288-2\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Charles\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Witchcraft\n  | publisher = Meridian\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n''Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power'' by Marvin W.

Several of his viziers were executed for various reasons. A famous anecdote relates how another vizier playfully asked the Sultan for some preliminary notice of his doom so that he might have time to put his affairs in order. The Sultan laughed and replied that indeed he had been thinking of having the vizier killed, but had no one fit to take his place, otherwise he would gladly oblige. A popular Ottoman curse was, \"May you be a vizier of Selim's,\" as a reference to the number of viziers he had executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-ottoman-empires-life-or-death-race-164064882/|title=The Ottoman Empire's Life-or-Death Race|last=Dash|first=Mike|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine}}</ref>\n\nSelim was one of the Empire's most successful and respected rulers, being energetic and hardworking. During his short eight years of ruling, he accomplished momentous success.

The Sultan hoped to lure Ismail into an open battle before his troops starved to death, and began writing insulting letters to the Shah, accusing him of cowardice:\n\n{{quote|They, who by perjuries seize scepters ought not to skulk from danger, but their breast ought, like the shield, to be held out to encounter peril; they ought, like the helm, to affront the foeman's blow.}}\n\nIsmail responded to Selim's third message, quoted above, by having an envoy deliver a letter accompanied by a box of opium. The Shah's letter insultingly implied that Selim's prose was the work of an unqualified writer on drugs. Selim was enraged by the Shah's denigration of his literary talent and ordered the Persian envoy to be torn to pieces.<ref>Crider, Elizabeth Fortuato (1969).

The Shah's letter insultingly implied that Selim's prose was the work of an unqualified writer on drugs.

It is produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".

It is produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".
