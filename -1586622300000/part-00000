Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers ''Lark'', ''Polarbjoern'', and ''Selis'' reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of [[Charles Francis Hall]]) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\"<ref>Forbes, 59\u201365</ref> They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.<ref>Hubbard Report</ref>\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland [[Baffin Island]]. On 30 July, ships ''Polaris'' and ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'' anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\"<ref>Forbes, 71</ref> The expedition consisted further of the [[USS Bear (1874)|USCGC ''Bear'']], equipped with a seaplane, the transports ''Fairfax'' and ''Eleanor'' and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.\n[[File:Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, aeronautical chart section.jpg|thumb|Frobisher Bay airport approaches with original station sites noted. USDOD ONC D-15, 1971]]\n\n===World War II===\nBy summer of 1943, the airbase at Koojesse Inlet had \"grown to look like a populous village\" and was in use by many aircraft.<ref>Forbes, 116</ref> It was designated Crystal II and referred to as ''Chaplet'' in coded communications. It was one of three \"Crystal\" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, [[Kuujjuaq|Fort Chimo]] (now Kuujjuaq), [[Quebec]] being \"Crystal I\", and a station on [[Padloping Island]] being \"Crystal III\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00076387|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230904/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAs part of the [[Crimson Route|Crimson East]] air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00180777|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230910/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at [[Presque Isle Air Force Base|Presque Isle Army Airfield]], Maine and the Central Route, which originated at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Romulus Army Airfield]] (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] and others at the [[Argentia]] summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from [[Churchill, Manitoba]] via [[Southampton Island]] over Frobisher to [[Sondrestrom Air Base|Bluie West Eight]] and [[Bluie East Two]] in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland.<ref>Hansen, 199\u2013200, 211\u2013215</ref> The later success of the main air route via [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]] and the spring 1943 victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|title=AFHRA Document 00076350|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811063933/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|archivedate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) in 1948, under its [[Air Weather Service]]. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the  \n[[United States]] and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\n===Civilian use===\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] for airlines flying the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Crews departing westward from [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] or [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in those years preferred to route via [[Iceland]] (or the [[Azores]]) to [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], thence to [[New York City]] or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. In 1959 [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, [[Nordair]] was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, {{Convert|1100|NM}} to the south. [[Douglas DC-4]]s operated into the 1970s and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]]s between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of [[de Havilland Canada]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s and [[Douglas DC-3]]s was serving many small [[Arctic]] communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|BAe 748]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with [[Air Canada]] and [[Canadian Airlines]] rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the [[Canadian North]] banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the [[Inuit]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four [[Boeing 727]]s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small [[Yellowknife]]-based carrier, Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary.

The passengers, after spending 16 hours in a local [[curling]] rink, were taken to New York to catch connecting flights to Los Angeles.

Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers ''Lark'', ''Polarbjoern'', and ''Selis'' reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of [[Charles Francis Hall]]) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\"<ref>Forbes, 59\u201365</ref> They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.<ref>Hubbard Report</ref>\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland [[Baffin Island]]. On 30 July, ships ''Polaris'' and ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'' anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\"<ref>Forbes, 71</ref> The expedition consisted further of the [[USS Bear (1874)|USCGC ''Bear'']], equipped with a seaplane, the transports ''Fairfax'' and ''Eleanor'' and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.\n[[File:Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, aeronautical chart section.jpg|thumb|Frobisher Bay airport approaches with original station sites noted.

It was one of three \"Crystal\" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, [[Kuujjuaq|Fort Chimo]] (now Kuujjuaq), [[Quebec]] being \"Crystal I\", and a station on [[Padloping Island]] being \"Crystal III\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00076387|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230904/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAs part of the [[Crimson Route|Crimson East]] air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00180777|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230910/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at [[Presque Isle Air Force Base|Presque Isle Army Airfield]], Maine and the Central Route, which originated at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Romulus Army Airfield]] (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] and others at the [[Argentia]] summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from [[Churchill, Manitoba]] via [[Southampton Island]] over Frobisher to [[Sondrestrom Air Base|Bluie West Eight]] and [[Bluie East Two]] in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland.<ref>Hansen, 199\u2013200, 211\u2013215</ref> The later success of the main air route via [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]] and the spring 1943 victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|title=AFHRA Document 00076350|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811063933/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|archivedate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) in 1948, under its [[Air Weather Service]]. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the  \n[[United States]] and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\n===Civilian use===\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] for airlines flying the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Crews departing westward from [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] or [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in those years preferred to route via [[Iceland]] (or the [[Azores]]) to [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], thence to [[New York City]] or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. In 1959 [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, [[Nordair]] was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, {{Convert|1100|NM}} to the south. [[Douglas DC-4]]s operated into the 1970s and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]]s between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of [[de Havilland Canada]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s and [[Douglas DC-3]]s was serving many small [[Arctic]] communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|BAe 748]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with [[Air Canada]] and [[Canadian Airlines]] rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the [[Canadian North]] banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the [[Inuit]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four [[Boeing 727]]s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small [[Yellowknife]]-based carrier, Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In acquiring NWT Air First Air obtained two 737-200 [[Combi aircraft|Combi]]s and a Lockheed [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|382 Hercules]].<ref>''Airways'' (June 2006) ''Pages 24-28'' ''YFB and First Air''</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n*2 hangar/cargo terminals (Canadian North) - hangar was terminal building until 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\">{{cite web|url=https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|title=Protected Blog \u203a Log in|author=|date=|website=chriswindeyer.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107023956/https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*1 two-storey terminal building c. 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\"/>\n*1 main runway\n*three aprons\n*1 FBO (Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services)\n*administration and control tower (former terminal)\n\nIqaluit International Airport Fire Department operates one crash tender for local fire suppression and has support from [[Iqaluit Fire Department]] when needed.\n\n==Terminal==\nThe main terminal (c.1986) has:\n*Check-in desks\n*3 gates\n*1 baggage claim belt\n*Gift shop\n*Travel agent\n*Tourist help desk\n*Car rental\n*Taxi service/rank\n*Baby/parent room\n*Disabled access/facilities\n*30 short term parking spaces\n* display cases for local artwork\n\nAs a result of increased traffic, limited post-security waiting area<ref name=\"case study\">{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Kloepfer |title=An airport public\u2013private partnership in the Canadian Arctic |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |publisher=Journal of Airport Management |year=2017 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=136\u2013146 |journal= |access-date=2019-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421044303/https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |archive-date=2019-04-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> and subsiding taxiway,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Greg A. |last1=Oldenborger |first2=Anne-Marie |last2=LeBlanc |title=Geophysical characterization of permafrost terrain at Iqaluit International Airport, Nunavut |journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics |year=2015 |volume=123 |pages=36\u201349 |doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.09.016}}</ref> the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250\u2013300 million.

For example, the ''[[Scientific American]]'' commented that \"even though one may not wholly surrender to Mr. Reinheimer's argument, or accord to his theory that supreme importance with which he invests it, there are in his volume so many important related facts, and so much pause-compelling suggestion, that his work must be reckoned with in any future study of Nature's methods.\"<ref>{{cite journal|year=1916|title=Symbiogenesis: The Universal Law of Progressive Evolution|journal=[[Scientific American]]|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951001389808f&view=1up&seq=53|volume=114|issue=|pages=49}}</ref> The book was positively reviewed in ''The Lancet'' journal which concluded it would be read with interest by many biologists.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1915|title=Symbiogenesis: The Universal Law of Progressive Evolution|journal=The Lancet|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101074831502&view=1up&seq=1912|volume=|issue=|pages=392}}</ref>\n\n[[Ashley Montagu]] wrote that Reinheimer's book ''Symbiosis'' \"which is all too little known, presents a very stimulating and well-balanced account of the facts\".<ref>Montagu, Ashley.

Surrounded by jazz, he was influenced at an early age by [[bebop]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Horace Silver]], and [[Lester Young]]. At eight he took up drums, which would influence his use of the piano as a percussion instrument.\n\nCorea developed his piano skills by exploring music on his own. A notable influence was concert pianist Salvatore Sullo, from whom Corea started taking lessons at age eight and who introduced him to classical music, helping spark his interest in musical composition. He also spent several years as a performer and soloist for the St. Rose Scarlet Lancers, a [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] based in Chelsea.\n\nGiven a black tuxedo by his father, he started playing gigs when in high school. He enjoyed listening to [[Herb Pomeroy]]'s band at the time and had a trio that played Horace Silver's music at a local jazz club. He moved to New York City, where he studied musical education for one month at [[Columbia University]] and six months at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. He quit after finding both disappointing, but he liked New York City and made it the starting point for his career.\n\n===Early career===\nCorea began his career in the early 1960s with [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Willie Bobo]], [[Blue Mitchell]], [[Herbie Mann]], and [[Stan Getz]]. He released his debut album, ''[[Tones for Joan's Bones]]'', in 1966. Two years later he released a trio album, ''[[Now He Sings, Now He Sobs]]'', with [[Roy Haynes]] and [[Miroslav Vitous]].<ref name=\"Yanow\">{{cite web|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott|title=Chick Corea|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chick-corea-mn0000110541/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn live performance he frequently processed the output of his electric piano with a device called a [[ring modulator]]. Using this style, he appeared on multiple Davis albums, including ''[[Black Beauty: Live at the Fillmore West]]'' and ''[[Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East]].'' His live performances with the Davis band continued into 1970, with a touring band of [[Steve Grossman (saxophonist)|Steve Grossman]], tenor sax, [[Keith Jarrett]], additional electric piano and organ, Jack DeJohnette, drums, [[Dave Holland]], bass, [[Airto Moreira]], percussion, and Davis on trumpet.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nHolland and Corea left to form their own group, [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]], active in 1970 and 1971. This free jazz group featured multi-reed player [[Anthony Braxton]] and drummer [[Barry Altschul]]. This band was recorded on [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] and [[ECM Records|ECM]]. Aside from soloing in an atonal style, Corea sometimes reached into the body of the piano and plucked the strings. In 1971 or 1972 Corea struck out on his own. In April 1971 he recorded the sessions that became ''[[Piano Improvisations Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Piano Improvisations Vol. 2]]'' for ECM.\n\n<blockquote>The concept of communication with an audience became a big thing for me at the time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life \u2013 in 1968, 1969 or so \u2013 was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chick Corea Interview |website=Artistinterviews.eu|url=http://www.artistinterviews.eu/?page_id=6&parent_id=22 | accessdate =March 28, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Jazz fusion===\nNamed after their eponymous 1972 album, Corea's [[Return to Forever]] relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of [[Flora Purim]] on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, [[Airto Moreira]] on drums , and [[Stanley Clarke]] on double bass.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> Drummer [[Lenny White]] and guitarist [[Bill Connors]] later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier [[Latin jazz]] elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], led by his ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album ''[[Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy]]'', before Connors' departure and replacement by [[Al Di Meola]], who was present on the subsequent releases ''[[Where Have I Known You Before]]'', ''[[No Mystery]]'', and ''[[Romantic Warrior]]''.\n\nIn 1976, he issued ''[[My Spanish Heart]]'', influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist [[Gayle Moran]] (Corea's wife) and electric violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. The album combined jazz and [[flamenco]], supported by [[Minimoog]] backup and a  horn section.\n\n===Duet projects===\n[[File:Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bobby McFerrin]] and Chick Corea, [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] in 2008]]\nIn the 1970s Corea started working with vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], with whom he recorded several duet albums for ECM, including 1972's ''[[Crystal Silence]]''. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called ''[[The New Crystal Silence]]'' was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy Award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nToward the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts and two albums with Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both pianists dressed formally and performing on Yamaha concert grand pianos. The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]. In 1982, Corea performed ''The Meeting'', a live duet with the classical pianist [[Friedrich Gulda]].\n[[File:B\u00e9la Fleck and Chick Corea 2, March 1, 2008.jpg|thumb|Corea performs with B\u00e9la Fleck on March 1, 2008.]]\nIn December 2007 Corea recorded a duet album, ''The Enchantment'', with banjoist [[B\u00e9la Fleck]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Doug |last=Levine |title=Chick Corea, Bela Fleck Collaborate On New CD |date=April 24, 2007 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-24-voa68.cfm |work=VOA News |accessdate=January 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124233626/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-24-voa68.cfm |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}</ref> Fleck and Corea toured extensively for the album in 2007.

The first concert in this series was played at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle)|Paramount Theatre]] in Seattle and included improvised music, songs by the duo, and standards by other composers.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=de Barros|title=Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea prove masters know how to have fun|date=March 15, 2015|url =http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/herbie-hancock-chick-corea-proved-masters-know-how-to-have-fun/| newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate =March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Later work===\nCorea's other bands include the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]], its traditional jazz trio reduction called Akoustic Band, Origin, and its traditional jazz trio reduction called the New Trio. Corea signed a record deal with [[GRP Records]] in 1986 which led to the release of ten albums between 1986 and 1994, seven with the Elektric Band, two with the Akoustic Band, and a solo album, ''Expressions''.\n\nThe Akoustic Band released a self-titled album in 1989 and a live follow-up, ''Alive'' in 1991, both featuring [[John Patitucci]] on bass and [[Dave Weckl]] on drums. It marked a turn back toward traditional jazz in Corea's career, and the bulk of his subsequent recordings have been acoustic ones. The Akoustic Band has toured intermittently, internationally since 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/chick-corea-akoustic-band-3bd6a074.html|title=Chick Corea Akoustic Band Concert Setlists (page 2)|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chickcorea.com/concerts/|title=Tour Schedule \u2013 Chick Corea|website=Chickcorea.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.frankgambaleonlineguitarschool.com/chick-corea-elektric-band-reunion-europe-tour-summer-2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713050254/https://www.frankgambaleonlineguitarschool.com/chick-corea-elektric-band-reunion-europe-tour-summer-2017/ |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XZu8DBLSs|title=THE CHICK COREA AKOUSTIC BAND.

The 11-song album includes only one standard composition ([[Fats Waller]]'s \"[[Jitterbug Waltz]]\"). The rest of the tunes are Corea originals. He participated in 1998's ''[[Like Minds (album)|Like Minds]]'' with Gary Burton on vibes, [[Pat Metheny]] on guitar, Dave Holland on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.\n\nDuring the latter part of his career, Corea became more interested in [[contemporary classical music]]. He composed his first [[piano concerto]] \u2013 and an adaptation of his signature piece, \"Spain\", for a full symphony orchestra \u2013 and performed it in 1999 with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Five years later he composed his first work not to feature any keyboards: his [[String quartet|String Quartet]] No. 1 was specifically written for the [[Orion String Quartet]] and performed by them at 2004's [[Summerfest]] in Wisconsin.\n\nCorea has continued releasing jazz fusion concept albums such as ''To the Stars'' (2004) and ''Ultimate Adventure'' (2006). The latter album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group]].\n\nIn 2008, the third version of Return to Forever (Corea, keyboards; Stanley Clarke, bass; [[Lenny White]], drums; Al Di Meola, guitar) reunited for a worldwide tour. The reunion received positive reviews from most jazz and mainstream publications.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/arts/music/03chin.html|work=The New York Times|title=The Return of Return to Forever | first=Nate | last=Chinen | date=August 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref> Most of the group's studio recordings were re-released on the compilation ''Return to Forever: The Anthology'' to coincide with the tour.

Drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] played with the band in Europe and on select North American dates; [[Brian Blade]] played all dates in Asia and Australia, and most dates in North America. The variety of Corea's music was celebrated in a 2011 retrospective with Corea playing with the [[Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra]] in the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]; a ''New York Times'' reviewer had high praise for the occasion: \"Mr. Corea was masterly with the other musicians, absorbing the rhythm and feeding the soloists.

Surrounded by jazz, he was influenced at an early age by [[bebop]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Horace Silver]], and [[Lester Young]]. At eight he took up drums, which would influence his use of the piano as a percussion instrument.\n\nCorea developed his piano skills by exploring music on his own. A notable influence was concert pianist Salvatore Sullo, from whom Corea started taking lessons at age eight and who introduced him to classical music, helping spark his interest in musical composition. He also spent several years as a performer and soloist for the St. Rose Scarlet Lancers, a [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] based in Chelsea.\n\nGiven a black tuxedo by his father, he started playing gigs when in high school. He enjoyed listening to [[Herb Pomeroy]]'s band at the time and had a trio that played Horace Silver's music at a local jazz club. He moved to New York City, where he studied musical education for one month at [[Columbia University]] and six months at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. He quit after finding both disappointing, but he liked New York City and made it the starting point for his career.\n\n===Early career===\nCorea began his career in the early 1960s with [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Willie Bobo]], [[Blue Mitchell]], [[Herbie Mann]], and [[Stan Getz]]. He released his debut album, ''[[Tones for Joan's Bones]]'', in 1966. Two years later he released a trio album, ''[[Now He Sings, Now He Sobs]]'', with [[Roy Haynes]] and [[Miroslav Vitous]].<ref name=\"Yanow\">{{cite web|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott|title=Chick Corea|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chick-corea-mn0000110541/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn live performance he frequently processed the output of his electric piano with a device called a [[ring modulator]]. Using this style, he appeared on multiple Davis albums, including ''[[Black Beauty: Live at the Fillmore West]]'' and ''[[Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East]].'' His live performances with the Davis band continued into 1970, with a touring band of [[Steve Grossman (saxophonist)|Steve Grossman]], tenor sax, [[Keith Jarrett]], additional electric piano and organ, Jack DeJohnette, drums, [[Dave Holland]], bass, [[Airto Moreira]], percussion, and Davis on trumpet.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nHolland and Corea left to form their own group, [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]], active in 1970 and 1971. This free jazz group featured multi-reed player [[Anthony Braxton]] and drummer [[Barry Altschul]]. This band was recorded on [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] and [[ECM Records|ECM]]. Aside from soloing in an atonal style, Corea sometimes reached into the body of the piano and plucked the strings. In 1971 or 1972 Corea struck out on his own. In April 1971 he recorded the sessions that became ''[[Piano Improvisations Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Piano Improvisations Vol. 2]]'' for ECM.\n\n<blockquote>The concept of communication with an audience became a big thing for me at the time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life \u2013 in 1968, 1969 or so \u2013 was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chick Corea Interview |website=Artistinterviews.eu|url=http://www.artistinterviews.eu/?page_id=6&parent_id=22 | accessdate =March 28, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Jazz fusion===\nNamed after their eponymous 1972 album, Corea's [[Return to Forever]] relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of [[Flora Purim]] on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, [[Airto Moreira]] on drums , and [[Stanley Clarke]] on double bass.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> Drummer [[Lenny White]] and guitarist [[Bill Connors]] later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier [[Latin jazz]] elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], led by his ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album ''[[Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy]]'', before Connors' departure and replacement by [[Al Di Meola]], who was present on the subsequent releases ''[[Where Have I Known You Before]]'', ''[[No Mystery]]'', and ''[[Romantic Warrior]]''.\n\nIn 1976, he issued ''[[My Spanish Heart]]'', influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist [[Gayle Moran]] (Corea's wife) and electric violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. The album combined jazz and [[flamenco]], supported by [[Minimoog]] backup and a  horn section.\n\n===Duet projects===\n[[File:Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bobby McFerrin]] and Chick Corea, [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] in 2008]]\nIn the 1970s Corea started working with vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], with whom he recorded several duet albums for ECM, including 1972's ''[[Crystal Silence]]''. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called ''[[The New Crystal Silence]]'' was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy Award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nToward the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts and two albums with Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both pianists dressed formally and performing on Yamaha concert grand pianos. The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]. In 1982, Corea performed ''The Meeting'', a live duet with the classical pianist [[Friedrich Gulda]].\n[[File:B\u00e9la Fleck and Chick Corea 2, March 1, 2008.jpg|thumb|Corea performs with B\u00e9la Fleck on March 1, 2008.]]\nIn December 2007 Corea recorded a duet album, ''The Enchantment'', with banjoist [[B\u00e9la Fleck]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Doug |last=Levine |title=Chick Corea, Bela Fleck Collaborate On New CD |date=April 24, 2007 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-24-voa68.cfm |work=VOA News |accessdate=January 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124233626/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-24-voa68.cfm |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}</ref> Fleck and Corea toured extensively for the album in 2007.

Corea signed a record deal with [[GRP Records]] in 1986 which led to the release of ten albums between 1986 and 1994, seven with the Elektric Band, two with the Akoustic Band, and a solo album, ''Expressions''.\n\nThe Akoustic Band released a self-titled album in 1989 and a live follow-up, ''Alive'' in 1991, both featuring [[John Patitucci]] on bass and [[Dave Weckl]] on drums. It marked a turn back toward traditional jazz in Corea's career, and the bulk of his subsequent recordings have been acoustic ones. The Akoustic Band has toured intermittently, internationally since 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/chick-corea-akoustic-band-3bd6a074.html|title=Chick Corea Akoustic Band Concert Setlists (page 2)|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chickcorea.com/concerts/|title=Tour Schedule \u2013 Chick Corea|website=Chickcorea.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.frankgambaleonlineguitarschool.com/chick-corea-elektric-band-reunion-europe-tour-summer-2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713050254/https://www.frankgambaleonlineguitarschool.com/chick-corea-elektric-band-reunion-europe-tour-summer-2017/ |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XZu8DBLSs|title=THE CHICK COREA AKOUSTIC BAND.

The 11-song album includes only one standard composition ([[Fats Waller]]'s \"[[Jitterbug Waltz]]\"). The rest of the tunes are Corea originals. He participated in 1998's ''[[Like Minds (album)|Like Minds]]'' with Gary Burton on vibes, [[Pat Metheny]] on guitar, Dave Holland on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.\n\nDuring the latter part of his career, Corea became more interested in [[contemporary classical music]]. He composed his first [[piano concerto]] \u2013 and an adaptation of his signature piece, \"Spain\", for a full symphony orchestra \u2013 and performed it in 1999 with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Five years later he composed his first work not to feature any keyboards: his [[String quartet|String Quartet]] No. 1 was specifically written for the [[Orion String Quartet]] and performed by them at 2004's [[Summerfest]] in Wisconsin.\n\nCorea has continued releasing jazz fusion concept albums such as ''To the Stars'' (2004) and ''Ultimate Adventure'' (2006). The latter album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group]].\n\nIn 2008, the third version of Return to Forever (Corea, keyboards; Stanley Clarke, bass; [[Lenny White]], drums; Al Di Meola, guitar) reunited for a worldwide tour. The reunion received positive reviews from most jazz and mainstream publications.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/arts/music/03chin.html|work=The New York Times|title=The Return of Return to Forever | first=Nate | last=Chinen | date=August 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref> Most of the group's studio recordings were re-released on the compilation ''Return to Forever: The Anthology'' to coincide with the tour. A concert DVD recorded during their performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] was released in May 2009. He also worked on a [[The Chick Corea Songbook|collaboration CD]] with the vocal group [[The Manhattan Transfer]].\n\n[[File:Chick Corea and John McLaughlin, Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City, 10 December 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Chick Corea's 75th birthday, Corea and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Blue Note Jazz Club]], New York City, 10 December 2016]]\n\nA new group, the [[Five Peace Band]], began a world tour in October 2008. Corea had worked with McLaughlin in Davis's late 1960s bands, including the group that recorded Davis's album ''Bitches Brew''. Joining Corea and McLaughlin were saxophonist [[Kenny Garrett]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]]. Drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] played with the band in Europe and on select North American dates; [[Brian Blade]] played all dates in Asia and Australia, and most dates in North America. The variety of Corea's music was celebrated in a 2011 retrospective with Corea playing with the [[Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra]] in the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]; a ''New York Times'' reviewer had high praise for the occasion: \"Mr. Corea was masterly with the other musicians, absorbing the rhythm and feeding the soloists. It sounded like a band, and Mr. Corea had no need to dominate; his authority was clear without raising volume.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/arts/music/24corea.html?_r=0| title=A Jazz Man Returns to His Past| last=Ratliff| first=Ben| date=23 January 2011| accessdate=20 June 2013| work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nA new band for 2013, Chick Corea & The Vigil, featured Corea with bassist [[Hadrien Feraud]], [[Marcus Gilmore]] on drums (carrying on from his grandfather, Roy Haynes), saxes, flute, and bass clarinet from [[Tim Garland]], and guitarist Charles Altura.\n\nCorea celebrated his 75th birthday in 2016 by playing with more than 20 different groups during a six-week stand at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club]] in Greenwich Village, New York City. \"I pretty well ignore the numbers that make up 'age'. It seems to be the best way to go.

Ron Hubbard]]'s most well known self-help book, and in the early 1970s developed an interest in Hubbard's science fiction novels.\n\n<blockquote>I came into contact with L.

In May 1917, he became the leader of the military organization of Bolsheviks in [[Saratov]], and in August 1917, he became the leader of the ''[[Polesia|Polessky]] Committee'' of the Bolshevik party in [[Belarus]]. During the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 he led the revolt in [[Gomel]].\n\nIn 1918 Kaganovich acted as [[Commissar]] of the propaganda department of the [[Red Army]]. From May 1918 to August 1919 he was the Chairman of the [[Ispolkom]] (Committee) of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Nizhny Novgorod gubernia]]. In 1919\u20131920, he served as governor of the [[Voronezh Governorate|Voronezh gubernia]]. The years 1920 to 1922 he spent in [[Turkmenistan]] as one of the leaders of the Bolshevik struggle against local [[Muslim]] rebels (''[[basmach]]i''), and also commanding the succeeding punitive expeditions against local opposition.\n\n==Communist functionary==\nIn May 1922, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] and immediately transferred Kaganovich to his apparatus to head the ''Organizational Bureau'' or [[Orgburo]] of the Secretariat. This department was responsible for all assignments within the apparatus of the Communist Party. Working there, Kaganovich helped to place Stalin's supporters in important jobs within the Communist Party bureaucracy. In this position he became noted for his great work capacity and for his personal loyalty to Stalin. He stated publicly that he would execute absolutely any order from Stalin, which at that time was a novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u041b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430. \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432, 1927.jpg|left|thumb|Lazar Kaganovich's speech.

From 1925 to 1928, Kaganovich was the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR]]. He was given the task of [[Ukrainization|\"ukrainizatsiya\"]] \u2013 meaning at that time the building up of Ukrainian communist popular cadres. He also had the duty of implementing [[collectivization]] and the policy of economic suppression of the [[kulak]]s (wealthier peasants). He opposed the more moderate policy of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who argued in favor of the \"peaceful integration of kulaks into socialism\". In 1928, due to numerous protests{{by whom|date=November 2014}} against Kaganovich's management, Stalin was forced to transfer Kaganovich from Ukraine to Moscow, where he returned to his position as a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a job he held until 1939. As Secretary, he endorsed Stalin's struggle against the so-called [[Left Opposition|Left]] and [[Right Opposition|Right]] Oppositions within the Communist Party, in the hope that Stalin would become the sole leader of the country. In 1933 and 1934, he served as the Chairman of the Commission for the Vetting of the Party Membership (''Tsentralnaya komissiya po proverke partiynykh ryadov'') and ensured personally that nobody associated with anti-Stalin opposition would be permitted to remain a Communist Party member. In 1934, at the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XVII Congress of the Communist Party]], Kaganovich chaired the Counting Committee. He falsified voting for positions in the Central Committee, deleting 290 votes opposing the Stalin candidacy. His actions resulted in Stalin's being re-elected as the General Secretary instead of [[Sergey Kirov]]. By the rules, the candidate receiving fewer opposing votes should become the General Secretary. Before Kaganovich's falsification, Stalin received 292 opposing votes and Kirov only three. However, the \"official\" result (due to the interference of Kaganovich) saw Stalin with just two opposing votes (Radzinsky, 1996).\n\nIn 1930, Kaganovich became a member of the Soviet [[16th Politburo and the 16th Secretariat of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Politburo]] and the First Secretary of the [[Moscow]] [[Obkom]] of the Communist Party (1930\u20131935). He later headed the Moscow [[Gorkom]] of the Communist Party (1931\u20131934). \nHe also supervised the implementation of many of Stalin's [[economics|economic]] policies, including the [[collectivization]] of [[agriculture]] and rapid [[industrialization]].  During this period, he also supervised the destruction of many of the city's oldest monuments, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].<ref name=\"REES001\">Rees, Edward Afron. 1994.

Kaganovicha'' after him until 1955.\n\nOn October 15, 1941, L. M. Kaganovich received an order to close the Moscow Metro, and within 3 hours to prepare proposals for its destruction, as a strategically important object. The metro was supposed to be destroyed, and the remaining cars and equipment removed. On the morning of October 16, 1941, on the day of the panic in Moscow, the metro was not opened for the first time. It was the only day in the history of the Moscow metro when it did not work. By evening, the order to destroy the metro was canceled.\n\nIn 1955, after the death of Stalin, the Moscow Metro was renamed to no longer include Kaganovich's name.\n\n==Responsibility for 1932\u201333 famine==\n[[File:Voroshilov Kaganovich Kosarev Molotov 1932.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kliment Voroshilov]], Lazar Kaganovich, Alexander Kosarev and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on the 7th Conference of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol).

Similar policies also inflicted enormous suffering on the Soviet Central Asian republic of [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Kuban]] region, [[Crimea]], the lower [[Volga]] region, and other parts of the Soviet Union. As an emissary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Kaganovich traveled to Ukraine, the central regions of the USSR, the [[North Caucasus Krai|Northern Caucasus]], and [[Siberia]] demanding the acceleration of collectivization and repressions against the Kulaks, who were generally blamed for the slow progress of collectivization.\nAttorney [[Rafael Lemkin]] in his work ''The Soviet Genocide in Ukraine'' tried to present the fact of Holodomor to the [[Nuremberg trials]] as a genocide of a totalitarian regime.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lemkin|first=Raphael|title=Holodomor: Reflections on the Great Famine of 1932\u20131933 in Soviet Ukraine|year=2009|publisher=Kashtan Press|authorlink=Raphael Lemkin|location=Kingston|chapter=Soviet Genocide in the Ukraine (reprint of 1951 article)}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 2010, [[Kiev]] [[Appellate Court]] [[Posthumous trial|posthumously]] found Kaganovich, [[Pavel Postyshev|Postyshev]], [[Stanislav Kosior|Kosior]], [[Vlas Chubar|Chubar]] and other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Communist Party functionaries guilty of [[genocide]] against Ukrainians during the catastrophic Holodomor famine.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100113/157536602.html Ukraine court finds Bolsheviks guilty of Holodomor genocide], [[RIA Novosti]] (13 January 2010)<br>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Yushchenko_Praises_Guilty_Verdict_Against_Soviet_Leaders_For_Famine/1929566.html Yushchenko Praises Guilty Verdict Against Soviet Leaders For Famine], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (14 January 2010)</ref> Though they were pronounced guilty as criminals, the case was ended immediately according to paragraph 8 of Article 6 of the Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine.<ref>[http://umoloda.kiev.ua/number/1574/222/55413/ The Kiev Court of Appeals named the organizers of Holodomor. by Ya.Muzychenko] {{in lang|uk}}</ref> By [[New Year's Day]], the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] had finished pre-court investigation and transferred its materials to the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]].

During 1939&ndash;1940, he served as [[Narkom for the Oil Industry]]. \nEach of his assignments was associated with arrests in order to improve discipline and compliance with Stalin's policies.\n\nIn all Party conferences of the later 1930s, he made speeches demanding increased efforts in the search for and prosecution of \"foreign spies\" and \"saboteurs\". For his ruthlessness in the execution of Stalin's orders, he was nicknamed \"Iron Lazar\".

He was also an early mentor of the eventual First Secretary of the Communist Party [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who first became important as Kaganovich's Moscow City deputy during the 1930s. In 1947, when Khrushchev was dismissed as the Party secretary of Ukraine (he remained in the somewhat lesser \"chief of government\" position), Stalin dispatched Kaganovich to replace him until Khrushchev was reinstated later that year.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Joseph Stalin Lazar Kaganovich 1933.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] and Lazar Kaganovich 1933|left]]\nKaganovich was a doctrinaire [[Stalinist]], and though he remained a member of the Presidium, he quickly lost influence after [[Stalin's death]] in March 1953. In 1957, along with fellow devoted Stalinists as well as other opponents of Khrushchev, Molotov, [[Dmitri Shepilov]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] (the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]), he participated in an abortive party coup against his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Khrushchev, whose [[De-Stalinization|criticism of Stalin]] had become increasingly harsh during the preceding two years. As a result of the unsuccessful coup, Kaganovich was forced to retire from the Presidium and the Central Committee, and was given the job of director of a small [[potash]] works in the Urals.<ref>Sebag Montefiore, Simon (2004).

He also lied about having interviewed Kaganovich personally and stated that Kaganovich admitted to being partially responsible for the death of Stalin in 1953 (supposedly by poisoning).

In May 1917, he became the leader of the military organization of Bolsheviks in [[Saratov]], and in August 1917, he became the leader of the ''[[Polesia|Polessky]] Committee'' of the Bolshevik party in [[Belarus]]. During the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 he led the revolt in [[Gomel]].\n\nIn 1918 Kaganovich acted as [[Commissar]] of the propaganda department of the [[Red Army]]. From May 1918 to August 1919 he was the Chairman of the [[Ispolkom]] (Committee) of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Nizhny Novgorod gubernia]]. In 1919\u20131920, he served as governor of the [[Voronezh Governorate|Voronezh gubernia]]. The years 1920 to 1922 he spent in [[Turkmenistan]] as one of the leaders of the Bolshevik struggle against local [[Muslim]] rebels (''[[basmach]]i''), and also commanding the succeeding punitive expeditions against local opposition.\n\n==Communist functionary==\nIn May 1922, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] and immediately transferred Kaganovich to his apparatus to head the ''Organizational Bureau'' or [[Orgburo]] of the Secretariat. This department was responsible for all assignments within the apparatus of the Communist Party. Working there, Kaganovich helped to place Stalin's supporters in important jobs within the Communist Party bureaucracy. In this position he became noted for his great work capacity and for his personal loyalty to Stalin. He stated publicly that he would execute absolutely any order from Stalin, which at that time was a novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u041b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430. \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432, 1927.jpg|left|thumb|Lazar Kaganovich's speech. Kharkov, Ukraine, 1927.]]\nIn 1924, Kaganovich became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. From 1925 to 1928, Kaganovich was the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR]]. He was given the task of [[Ukrainization|\"ukrainizatsiya\"]] \u2013 meaning at that time the building up of Ukrainian communist popular cadres. He also had the duty of implementing [[collectivization]] and the policy of economic suppression of the [[kulak]]s (wealthier peasants). He opposed the more moderate policy of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who argued in favor of the \"peaceful integration of kulaks into socialism\". In 1928, due to numerous protests{{by whom|date=November 2014}} against Kaganovich's management, Stalin was forced to transfer Kaganovich from Ukraine to Moscow, where he returned to his position as a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a job he held until 1939. As Secretary, he endorsed Stalin's struggle against the so-called [[Left Opposition|Left]] and [[Right Opposition|Right]] Oppositions within the Communist Party, in the hope that Stalin would become the sole leader of the country. In 1933 and 1934, he served as the Chairman of the Commission for the Vetting of the Party Membership (''Tsentralnaya komissiya po proverke partiynykh ryadov'') and ensured personally that nobody associated with anti-Stalin opposition would be permitted to remain a Communist Party member. In 1934, at the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XVII Congress of the Communist Party]], Kaganovich chaired the Counting Committee. He falsified voting for positions in the Central Committee, deleting 290 votes opposing the Stalin candidacy. His actions resulted in Stalin's being re-elected as the General Secretary instead of [[Sergey Kirov]]. By the rules, the candidate receiving fewer opposing votes should become the General Secretary. Before Kaganovich's falsification, Stalin received 292 opposing votes and Kirov only three. However, the \"official\" result (due to the interference of Kaganovich) saw Stalin with just two opposing votes (Radzinsky, 1996).\n\nIn 1930, Kaganovich became a member of the Soviet [[16th Politburo and the 16th Secretariat of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Politburo]] and the First Secretary of the [[Moscow]] [[Obkom]] of the Communist Party (1930\u20131935). He later headed the Moscow [[Gorkom]] of the Communist Party (1931\u20131934). \nHe also supervised the implementation of many of Stalin's [[economics|economic]] policies, including the [[collectivization]] of [[agriculture]] and rapid [[industrialization]].  During this period, he also supervised the destruction of many of the city's oldest monuments, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].<ref name=\"REES001\">Rees, Edward Afron. 1994.

Kaganovicha'' after him until 1955.\n\nOn October 15, 1941, L. M. Kaganovich received an order to close the Moscow Metro, and within 3 hours to prepare proposals for its destruction, as a strategically important object. The metro was supposed to be destroyed, and the remaining cars and equipment removed. On the morning of October 16, 1941, on the day of the panic in Moscow, the metro was not opened for the first time. It was the only day in the history of the Moscow metro when it did not work.

Similar policies also inflicted enormous suffering on the Soviet Central Asian republic of [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Kuban]] region, [[Crimea]], the lower [[Volga]] region, and other parts of the Soviet Union.

For his ruthlessness in the execution of Stalin's orders, he was nicknamed \"Iron Lazar\".

During 1943&ndash;1944, he was again the Narkom for the railways. In 1943, he was presented with the title of [[Hero of Socialist Labour]]. From 1944 to 1947, Kaganovich was the [[Minister for Building Materials]].\n\nIn 1947, he became the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. From 1948 to 1952, he served as the Chairman of [[Gossnab]] (State Committee for Material-Technical Supply, charged with the primary responsibility for the allocation of producer goods to enterprises, a critical state function in the absence of markets), and from 1952 to 1957, as the [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Vice-Premier]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]. He was also the first Chairman of [[State Committee for Labour and Social Problems|Goskomtrud]] (State Committee for Labour and Wages, charged with introducing the minimum wage, with other wage policy, and with improving the old-age pension system).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nUntil 1957, Kaganovich was a voting member of the Politburo as well as the [[Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]. He was also an early mentor of the eventual First Secretary of the Communist Party [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who first became important as Kaganovich's Moscow City deputy during the 1930s. In 1947, when Khrushchev was dismissed as the Party secretary of Ukraine (he remained in the somewhat lesser \"chief of government\" position), Stalin dispatched Kaganovich to replace him until Khrushchev was reinstated later that year.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Joseph Stalin Lazar Kaganovich 1933.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] and Lazar Kaganovich 1933|left]]\nKaganovich was a doctrinaire [[Stalinist]], and though he remained a member of the Presidium, he quickly lost influence after [[Stalin's death]] in March 1953. In 1957, along with fellow devoted Stalinists as well as other opponents of Khrushchev, Molotov, [[Dmitri Shepilov]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] (the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]), he participated in an abortive party coup against his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Khrushchev, whose [[De-Stalinization|criticism of Stalin]] had become increasingly harsh during the preceding two years. As a result of the unsuccessful coup, Kaganovich was forced to retire from the Presidium and the Central Committee, and was given the job of director of a small [[potash]] works in the Urals.<ref>Sebag Montefiore, Simon (2004).

In the book, Kahan made a series of claims about Kaganovich's working relationship with Stalin and his activities during the Ukrainian famine, and claimed to be Kaganovich's long-lost nephew. He also claimed to have interviewed Kaganovich personally and stated that Kaganovich admitted to being partially responsible for the death of Stalin in 1953 (supposedly by poisoning). A number of other unusual claims were made as well, including that Stalin was married to a sister of Kaganovich (supposedly named \"Rosa\") during the last year of his life and that Kaganovich (who was raised Jewish) was the architect of anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s.<ref name=\"kah\">Kahan, Stuart.
