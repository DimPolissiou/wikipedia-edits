It is recognized by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' to be the longest continuously running movie franchise, having been in ongoing production from 1954 to the present day, with several hiatuses of varying lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/9/jennifer-lawrence-game-of-thrones-frozen-among-new-entertainment-record-holders-in-guinness-world-records-2015-book-60021/|title=Jennifer Lawrence, Game of Thrones, Frozen among new entertainment record holders in Guinness World Records 2015 book|last=Guinness World Records|work=Guinness World Records|date=September 3, 2014| access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> The film franchise consists of 36 films, 32 produced by Toho and four Hollywood films: one film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and three films produced by [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]].\n\nThe first film, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', was directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by [[Akira Ifukube]], which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], who used miniatures and \"suitmation\" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction. For its North American release, the film was reworked as an adaptation and released in 1956 as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]''. The adaptation featured new footage with [[Raymond Burr]] edited together with the original Japanese footage.\n\nToho was inspired to make the original ''Godzilla'' after the commercial success of the 1952 re-release of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and the success of ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953) the first live-action film to feature a giant monster awakened following an atomic bomb detonation <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Darwin and the Atom : Evolution/Devolution Fantasies in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Them !, and The Incredible Shrinking Man|journal= Science Fiction Studies|date=July 1998|publisher=SF-TH Inc|location=Greencastle (Indiana)|pages=320}}</ref>. The success of the ''Godzilla'' series itself would go on to inspire other monster films worldwide. The popularity of the films has led to the franchise expanding to other media, such as [[Godzilla in popular culture|television, music, literature]] and [[List of Godzilla games|video games]]. Godzilla has been one of the most recognizable symbols in Japanese pop culture worldwide, remains a well-known facet of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese films]] and was one of the first examples of the popular ''kaiju'' and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' subgenres in Japanese entertainment.\n\nThe tone and themes vary per film. Several of the films have political themes, others have dark tones, [[shared universe|complex internal mythology]], or are simple action movies featuring aliens or other monsters, while others have simpler themes accessible to children.{{sfn|Kalat|1997|pp=1\u20135}} Godzilla's role varies from purely a destructive force to an ally of humans, or a protector of Japanese values, or a hero to children. The name '''Godzilla''' is a romanization of the original Japanese name '''Gojira'''\u2014which is a combination of two Japanese words: ''gorira'' (\u30b4\u30ea\u30e9), \"gorilla\", and ''kujira'' (\u30af\u30b8\u30e9), \"whale\". The word alludes to the size, power and aquatic origin of Godzilla. As developed by Toho, the monster is an offshoot of the combination of radioactivity and ancient dinosaur-like creatures, indestructible and possessing special powers (see [[Godzilla#Characteristics|Godzilla characteristics]]).\n\n==History==\nThe ''Godzilla'' film series is broken into several (different) eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga ([[monster movies]]) in Japan. The first two eras refer to the [[Japanese emperor]] during production: the [[Sh\u014dwa era]] and the [[Heisei era]]. The third is called the Millennium era as the emperor ([[Heisei]]) is the same but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\nOver the series' history, the films have reflected [[History of Japan|the social and political climate in Japan]].{{sfn|Kalat|1997|p=240}} In the original film, Godzilla was an [[allegory]] for the effects of the [[nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and the consequences that such weapons might have on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/vqr-portfolio/godzilla%E2%80%99s-footprint|title=Godzilla's Footprint|last=Ryfle|first=Steve|work=VQR Online| access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2127-godzilla-poetry-after-the-a-bomb|title=Godzilla: Poetry After the A-Bomb|last=Hoberman|first=J.|work=Criterion|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' 1954 [[Toho]]</ref><ref>''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' 1984 [[Toho]]</ref> The radioactive contamination of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|Lucky Dragon No. 5]]'' through the United States' [[Castle Bravo]] [[thermonuclear]] device test on [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, led to much press coverage in Japan preceding the release of the first movie in 1954.{{sfn|Kennedy, et. al|2019|p=8}} The Heisei and Millennium series have largely continued this concept.\n\n===Sh\u014dwa era (1954\u20131975)===\n[[File:Godzilla 1954-2014 incarnations.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Every film incarnation of Godzilla between 1954 and 2017|alt=montage of pictures of dinosaur-like creatures]]\nThe initial series of movies is named for the Sh\u014dwa period in Japan (as all of these films were produced before the \"''Sh\u014dwa Emperor''\" [[Hirohito]]'s death in 1989).{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=29}} This Sh\u014dwa timeline spanned from 1954, with ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', to 1975, with ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. With the exceptions of ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'', and ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]'', much of the Sh\u014dwa series monster-action was intentionally made comical and laughable for children, with Godzilla frequently engaged in clownish slapstick wrestling with other monsters. Starting with ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Godzilla began evolving into a friendlier, more playful [[antihero]] (this transition was complete by ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'', where Godzilla is depicted as a more virtuous character) and, as years went by, it evolved into an [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]]. \n\n''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'' was also significant for introducing Godzilla's archenemy and the main antagonist of the film series, [[King Ghidorah]]. The films ''Son of Godzilla'' and ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' were aimed at youthful audiences, featuring the appearance of Godzilla's son, [[Minilla]]. ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' was notable for introducing Godzilla's robot duplicate and the secondary antagonist of the film series, [[Mechagodzilla]]. The Sh\u014dwa period loosely tied in to a number of Toho-produced films in which Godzilla himself did not appear and consequently saw the addition of many monsters into the ''Godzilla'' continuity, three of which ([[Rodan]], [[Varan]], and [[Mothra]]) originated in their own solo movies and another five ([[Anguirus]], [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]], [[Baragon]], [[Gorosaurus]] and [[Kumonga]]) appeared in their first films as either secondary antagonists or secondary kaiju.\n\n[[Haruo Nakajima]] mainly portrayed Godzilla since 1954 until his retirement in 1972. However, other stunt actors have portrayed the character in his absence, such as [[Katsumi Tezuka]], Y\u016b Sekida, Ryosaku Takasugi, Seiji Onaka, Shinji Takagi, Isao Zushi, and [[Toru Kawai]].<ref name=\"Godzilla\">{{cite video|people=Takeo Murata (writer) and Ishir\u014d Honda (writer/director)|title=[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Am.

His protege Sadamasa Arikawa took over the effects work for the next three films (with Tsuburaya supervising), while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] directed the special effects for the last six films of the series. [[The Criterion Collection]] released the Sh\u014dwa era films as part of a Blu-ray box set in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2019.<ref name=\"Criterion Set\"/>\n\n===Heisei era (1984\u20131995)===\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'', starting the second era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the ''Heisei'' series.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} ''The Return of Godzilla'' serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Showa era. ''The Return of Godzilla'' was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}}\n\nThe Heisei films are set in a single timeline, with each film providing continuity to the other films, and brings Godzilla back as a destructive force of nature that is feared by humans.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} The biological nature and science behind Godzilla became a much more discussed issue in the films, showing the increased focus on the moral aspects of genetics. ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' gave the first concrete birth story for Godzilla, featuring a dinosaur named ''Godzillasaurus'' that was mutated by nuclear radiation into Godzilla. Godzilla was portrayed by [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] for the Heisei films while the special effects were directed by [[Koichi Kawakita]], with the exception of ''The Return of Godzilla'', for which the effects were directed by Teruyoshi Nakano.\n\n===Millennium era (1999\u20132004)===\nToho rebooted the franchise for a second time with the 1999 film ''[[Godzilla 2000|Godzilla 2000: Millennium]]'' starting the third era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the Millennium series.{{sfn|Baker|2019|p=92}} The Millennium series is treated similarly to an [[anthology series]] where each film is a standalone story, with the 1954 film serving as the only previous point of reference. ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' are the only films in the series to share continuity with each other, which in turn share continuity with ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' and ''[[The War of the Gargantuas]]'' (films that were produced in the Showa era).\n\nAfter the release of 2004's ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', marking the 50th anniversary of the ''Godzilla'' film franchise, Toho decided to put the series on hiatus for another 10 years. Toho also demolished the water stage on its lot used in numerous ''Godzilla'', kaiju and tokusatsu films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |title=Bucket Hall of Fame: The Toho Big Pool | access-date=February 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229081538/http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |archivedate=December 29, 2010 }}</ref> [[Yoshimitsu Banno]], who had directed 1971's ''[[Godzilla vs. Hedorah]]'', secured the rights from Toho to make an [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] short film production, based on a story similar to his ''Hedorah'' film. This project eventually led to the development of [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Legendary's ''Godzilla'']].\n\n[[Tsutomu Kitagawa]] portrayed Godzilla for the majority of the Millennium films, with the exception of ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', in which Godzilla was portrayed by [[Mizuho Yoshida (actor)|Mizuho Yoshida]]. Unlike the Showa and later Heisei films, the special effects for the Millennium films were directed by multiple effects directors such as [[Kenji Suzuki (director)|Kenji Suzuki]] (''Godzilla 2000'', ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]''), Makoto Kamiya (''Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack''), Yuichi Kikuchi (''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla''), and Eiichi Asada

The film utilized a majority of the footage from the Japanese original, but a majority of the political themes and social commentaries were removed, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese original replaced with new scenes shot exclusively for the film featuring Raymond Burr as American journalist Steve Martin interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, sound effects and the soundtrack were tweaked and some dialogue was dubbed into English. \n\nIn 1957, producer Harry Rybnick attempted to produce a Hollywood-made alteration of ''Godzilla Raids Again'' titled ''The Volcano Monsters'', using some of the Japanese footage from the former to make a totally different film; however, funding from AB-PT Pictures collapsed after the company closed down and ''Godzilla Raids Again'' was instead dubbed in English and released in 1959 by [[Warner Bros.]] as ''Gigantis the Fire Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/the-first-hollywood-attempt-to-re-imagine-godzilla-ha-1573231492|title=The First Hollywood Attempt to \"Reimagine\" Godzilla Happened Back in 1957|last=Lizardman|work=Observation Deck|date=May 7, 2014| access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSimilar \"Americanizations\" occurred for the North American releases of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla 1985]],'' the latter which included Burr reprising his role of American journalist Steve Martin.\n\nIn 1976, Italian director [[Luigi Cozzi]] intended to re-release ''Godzilla'' in Italy. Facing resistance from exhibitors to showing a black-and-white film, Cozzi instead licensed a negative of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' from Toho and created a new movie in color, adding lots of stock footage of graphic death and destruction and short scenes from newsreel footage from World War II, which he released as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!#\"Cozzilla\"|Godzilla]]'' in 1977. The film was colorized using a process called Spectrorama 70, where color gels are put on the original black-and-white film, becoming one of the first black-and-white movies to be colorized. Dialogue was dubbed into Italian and new music was added. After the initial Italian run, the negative became Toho's property and prints have only been exhibited in Italy from that time onward. Italian firm Yamato Video at one time intended to release the colorized version on a two-disc DVD along with the original ''Godzilla''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2009/05/31/talking-cozzilla-an-interview-with-italian-godzilla-director-luigi-cozzi/ |title=Talking COZZILLA: An Interview with Italian GODZILLA Director Luigi Cozzi |publisher=SciFi Japan | access-date=November 11, 2012 |last=Desentis |first=John}}</ref>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=207}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=208}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25px\" | #\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Title\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Director(s)\n! style=\"width:140px;\"|Effects director\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Monster co-star(s)\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Current U.S. licenses\n|-\n|1\n|''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]''\n|[[1956 in film|1956]]\n|[[Ishir\u014d Honda]]<br />[[Terry O.

The first one is the collaboration series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and co-produced by [[Toho]], ''[[Godzilla (1978 TV series)|Godzilla]]''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=209}} The second one is the series produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', which is a cartoon sequel to the [[Godzilla (1998 film)#Cancelled sequels|1998 film]].{{sfn|Kennedy, et. al|2019|p=72}} Both series feature a scientific investigative team who call upon Godzilla as an ally, as well as making several homages to the Sh\u014dwa films. Several antagonist monsters in both series have been inspired by extant Toho creations.\n\nIn 1991, two ''Godzilla'' films, ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' and ''Godzilla versus the Sea Monster'', were shown on the movie-mocking TV show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\nA parody creature resembling Godzilla, alongside another parody character resembling what appears to be a hybrid between [[Ultraman]] and [[Kamen Rider]], appears in the television special ''[[Olive, the Other Reindeer]]'' during the song \"Merry Christmas After All\", during part of which Olive, Santa and the other reindeer are shown passing through Tokyo delivering gifts. The two characters are shown to be friendly and taking part in the song and dance routine shown to include numerous figures, both real and fictional, in the show in various locations visited by the team as they make Santa's annual trip around the world.\n\nGodzilla made an appearance in a [[Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley|Nike commercial]] in which Godzilla (this version was created at ILM) went one-on-one in an oversized basketball game with a giant version of the NBA star [[Charles Barkley]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Martha T. |last=Moore |title=Godzilla Meets Barkley on MTV |work=USA Today |date=September 9, 1992 |p=1.B.}}</ref>\n\nGodzilla has been referenced multiple times in the American animated TV sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Godzilla first appeared in the episode \"[[Lisa on Ice]]\" when Lisa imagines herself on Monster Island and is chased by various kaiju, including Godzilla. It has also been referenced in \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\", \"[[Mayored to the Mob]]\" (where Godzilla can be seen signing autographs at the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con), \"[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]\" (in which the plane carrying the Simpson family is being attacked by Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and Gamera), \"[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]\", \"[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]\", \"[[Homerazzi]]\", \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\", \"[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]\", \"[[Treehouse of Horror XXIV]]\" and \"[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n! style=\"width:200px;\" | Title\n! width=\"50\"|Year\n!

The art style is similar to that of the chibi-style ''Godzilland'' series. In 1990, ''Gojira-kun: Kaij\u016b Daik\u014dshin'' was released for the Game Boy. It featured sprites that were similar to the ones used in ''Gojira-kun''. The game included cut scenes that depicted a different style to the rest of the game. In 1993, ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' 's Bagan, a newly created Toho-approved creation (which had previously been intended for appearances in several 1990s Toho films that were never made), was released for the SNES and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju in a former film/movie.\n\nIn 2007, ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'', featuring Krystalak and Obsidius, two newly created Toho-approved creations, was released for the Wii and DS and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju. Legendary's Godzilla was featured as a playable character in Bandai Namco's 2014 video game ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'' as \"Hollywood Godzilla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/ps4/games/godzilla/119160|title=Godzilla for PlayStation 4|work=Gamestop|date=| access-date=May 30, 2015}}</ref> The widely popular video game ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' has made multiple references to Godzilla. The Dark/Rock type Pok\u00e9mon [[Tyranitar]] is a direct reference to Godzilla. The Pok\u00e9mon's appearance is a large green lizard monster-type creature who is characterised as an unstoppable force. In 2015\u2013present, ''Gojira'' and ''Godzilla 2600'' from the [[Homebrew (video games)|Homebrew]] fangame were released for the NES and Atari 2600.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Godzilla (comics)}}\nA ''Godzilla'' [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|series of books]] was published by [[Random House]] during the late 1990s and the first half of 2000. The company created different series for different age groups, the [[Godzilla (Scott Ciencin series)|Scott Ciencin series]] being aimed at preteens and the [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|Marc Cerasini series]] being aimed at teens and young adults. Several [[manga]] have been derived from specific ''Godzilla'' films and both [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] have published ''Godzilla'' comic book series (1977\u20131979 and 1987\u20131999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series, ''Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters'' (published in book form under the same title), rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, ''Godzilla'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster'') and ''Godzilla: Rulers of Earth'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 1'' and ''Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 2''), as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.\n\nTo tie-in with the 2014 film, three books were published. [[Titan Books]] published a novelization of the movie in May 2014, written by Greg Cox. The graphic novel ''Godzilla: Awakening'' by Max Borenstein, Greg Borenstein and Eric Battle served as a prequel, and ''Godzilla: The Art of Destruction'' by Mark Cotta told about the making of the movie. Godzilla has been referenced in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' comics on three separate occasions. The character is featured in ''Bart Simpson's Guide to Life'' where it and other kaiju characters such as [[Minilla]] and [[King Ghidorah]] can be seen; it is featured in the comic \"''An Anime Among Us!''\" and ''K-Bart''.  Godzilla is also featured in the comic ''Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror 7'' where it and other kaiju can be seen referenced on the front cover. Godzilla has also been referenced in Marc Brown's ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' adventure book called ''Arthur's April Fool'', where Francine told Arthur and Buster that they need to pick on someone their own size, like Godzilla. Both [[Godzilla]] and [[Arthur Read|Arthur]] became the two of the most popular characters to root for.\n\n===Music===\n''[[Godzilla: The Album]]'', the [[soundtrack album]] of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), sold 2.5{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dud 'Godzilla' Still Music To Sony's Ears |url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-22/news/25735413_1_music-sales-soundtrack-albums-biggest-album |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922112642/http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-22/news/25735413_1_music-sales-soundtrack-albums-biggest-album |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 22, 2015 | access-date=September 22, 2015 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 22, 1998}}</ref> The album's lead single, \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come with Me]]\" by [[Puff Daddy]] featuring [[Jimmy Page]], sold a certified 2.025{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide.<ref>See {{Section link|Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Certifications}}</ref> Its Japan-exclusive single, \"[[Shinshoku (Lose Control)|Lose Control]]\" by [[Japanese rock]] band [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], sold 938,401 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shinshoku ~Lose Control~ |url=http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Shinshoku_~Lose_Control~ |website=Generasia | access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Shin Godzilla|Shin Godzilla Ongakushuu]]'', the soundtrack album of ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'' (2016), sold 43,951 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=2016 Oricon Top 100 Albums |url=http://www.generasia.com/wiki/2016_Oricon_Top_100_Albums |website=Generasia | access-date=August 19, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> ''[[Mars (B'z album)|Mars]]'' (1991), an album by the Japanese rock duo [[B'z]] featuring a Godzilla-themed song, sold 1,730,500 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |title=B'z\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u8a18\u9332\u66f4\u65b0\u3078\uff01\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01 |url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/21023/full/ |work=[[Oricon News]] |publisher=[[Oricon]] |date=2006-05-10 |language=ja-JP}}</ref>\n\n[[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]] released the song \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\" in 1977.

The instrumental version of this song was notably used in the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. The British band [[Lostprophets]] released a song called \"[[We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan]]\" on its second studio album ''[[Start Something]]''. The American punk band [[Groovie Ghoulies]] released a song called \"Hats off to You (Godzilla)\" as a tribute to Godzilla. It is featured on the EP ''Freaks on Parade'' released in 2002. \n\nThe American artist [[Doctor Steel]] released a song called 'Atomic Superstar' about Godzilla on his album ''[[People of Earth (album)|People of Earth]]'' in 2002. In 2003, the British singer [[Siouxsie Sioux]] released the album ''[[H\u00e1i!]]'' with her band [[The Creatures]]; the album had a Japanese theme with a song dedicated to the monster, simply titled \"[[Godzilla!]]\". The record label Shifty issued the compilation album ''Destroysall'' with 15 songs from 15 bands, ranging from hardcore punk to doom-laden death metal. Not all of the songs are dedicated to Godzilla, but all do appear connected to monsters from Toho Studios. Fittingly, the disc was released on August 1, 2003, the 35th anniversary of the Japanese release of ''Destroy All Monsters''.\n\nKing Geedorah (a.k.a. [[MF Doom|MF DOOM]]) released ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'', a hip-hop album featuring guests from the group [[Monsta Island Czars]], another Godzilla-themed hip-hop group.

Taiwanese American electronic musician [[Mochipet]] released the EP ''Godzilla Rehab Center'' on August 21, 2012, featuring songs named after monsters in the series including Gigan, King Ghidorah, Moguera and Hedorah.\n\nIn 2019, American rock band Think Sanity released their debut album featuring songs based on Godzilla, Mothra, and Hedorah. The songs are titled \"Sad Kaiju\", \"Mothra\", and \"Sludge\", respectively. The monsters are also mentioned by name on the track \"News at Six\" in which they are comically described by newscaster Chip Bentley as destroying a nearby town. The band has mentioned in interviews that they have also written songs based on Biollante, King Ghidorah, and Rodan as well.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{Main|Godzilla in popular culture}}\n\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of [[Japanese popular culture]] worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the [[Kaij\u016b|kaiju]] subset of the [[tokusatsu]] genre. It has been considered a filmographic [[metaphor]] for the United States (with the \"[[-zilla]]\" part of the name being used in vernacular language as a suffix to indicate something of exaggerated proportions), as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier ''Godzilla'' films, especially the original ''Godzilla'', portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] and the possibility of recurrence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/popcult/handouts/metaphor/godzilla/godzilla.html |title=The Monster That Morphed Into a Metaphor |author=Terrence Rafferty |date=May 2, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nAt least two [[prehistoric creatures]] from the [[fossil record]] have been named after Godzilla.

It is recognized by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' to be the longest continuously running movie franchise, having been in ongoing production from 1954 to the present day, with several hiatuses of varying lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/9/jennifer-lawrence-game-of-thrones-frozen-among-new-entertainment-record-holders-in-guinness-world-records-2015-book-60021/|title=Jennifer Lawrence, Game of Thrones, Frozen among new entertainment record holders in Guinness World Records 2015 book|last=Guinness World Records|work=Guinness World Records|date=September 3, 2014| access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> The film franchise consists of 36 films, 32 produced by Toho and four Hollywood films: one film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and three films produced by [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]].\n\nThe first film, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', was directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by [[Akira Ifukube]], which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], who used miniatures and \"suitmation\" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction. For its North American release, the film was reworked as an adaptation and released in 1956 as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]''. The adaptation featured new footage with [[Raymond Burr]] edited together with the original Japanese footage.\n\nToho was inspired to make the original ''Godzilla'' after the commercial success of the 1952 re-release of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and the success of ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953) the first live-action film to feature a giant monster awakened following an atomic bomb detonation <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Darwin and the Atom : Evolution/Devolution Fantasies in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Them !, and The Incredible Shrinking Man|journal= Science Fiction Studies|date=July 1998|publisher=SF-TH Inc|location=Greencastle (Indiana)|pages=320}}</ref>. The success of the ''Godzilla'' series itself would go on to inspire other monster films worldwide. The popularity of the films has led to the franchise expanding to other media, such as [[Godzilla in popular culture|television, music, literature]] and [[List of Godzilla games|video games]]. Godzilla has been one of the most recognizable symbols in Japanese pop culture worldwide, remains a well-known facet of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese films]] and was one of the first examples of the popular ''kaiju'' and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' subgenres in Japanese entertainment.\n\nThe tone and themes vary per film. Several of the films have political themes, others have dark tones, [[shared universe|complex internal mythology]], or are simple action movies featuring aliens or other monsters, while others have simpler themes accessible to children.{{sfn|Kalat|1997|pp=1\u20135}} Godzilla's role varies from purely a destructive force to an ally of humans, or a protector of Japanese values, or a hero to children. The name '''Godzilla''' is a romanization of the original Japanese name '''Gojira'''\u2014which is a combination of two Japanese words: ''gorira'' (\u30b4\u30ea\u30e9), \"gorilla\", and ''kujira'' (\u30af\u30b8\u30e9), \"whale\". The word alludes to the size, power and aquatic origin of Godzilla. As developed by Toho, the monster is an offshoot of the combination of radioactivity and ancient dinosaur-like creatures, indestructible and possessing special powers (see [[Godzilla#Characteristics|Godzilla characteristics]]).\n\n==History==\nThe ''Godzilla'' film series is broken into several (different) eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga ([[monster movies]]) in Japan. The first two eras refer to the [[Japanese emperor]] during production: the [[Sh\u014dwa era]] and the [[Heisei era]]. The third is called the Millennium era as the emperor ([[Heisei]]) is the same but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\nOver the series' history, the films have reflected [[History of Japan|the social and political climate in Japan]].{{sfn|Kalat|1997|p=240}} In the original film, Godzilla was an [[allegory]] for the effects of the [[nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and the consequences that such weapons might have on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/vqr-portfolio/godzilla%E2%80%99s-footprint|title=Godzilla's Footprint|last=Ryfle|first=Steve|work=VQR Online| access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2127-godzilla-poetry-after-the-a-bomb|title=Godzilla: Poetry After the A-Bomb|last=Hoberman|first=J.|work=Criterion|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' 1954 [[Toho]]</ref><ref>''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' 1984 [[Toho]]</ref> The radioactive contamination of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|Lucky Dragon No. 5]]'' through the United States' [[Castle Bravo]] [[thermonuclear]] device test on [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, led to much press coverage in Japan preceding the release of the first movie in 1954.{{sfn|Kennedy, et. al|2019|p=8}} The Heisei and Millennium series have largely continued this concept.\n\n===Sh\u014dwa era (1954\u20131975)===\n[[File:Godzilla 1954-2014 incarnations.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Every film incarnation of Godzilla between 1954 and 2017|alt=montage of pictures of dinosaur-like creatures]]\nThe initial series of movies is named for the Sh\u014dwa period in Japan (as all of these films were produced before the \"''Sh\u014dwa Emperor''\" [[Hirohito]]'s death in 1989).{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=29}} This Sh\u014dwa timeline spanned from 1954, with ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', to 1975, with ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. With the exceptions of ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'', and ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]'', much of the Sh\u014dwa series monster-action was intentionally made comical and laughable for children, with Godzilla frequently engaged in clownish slapstick wrestling with other monsters. Starting with ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Godzilla began evolving into a friendlier, more playful [[antihero]] (this transition was complete by ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'', where Godzilla is depicted as a more virtuous character) and, as years went by, it evolved into an [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]]. \n\n''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'' was also significant for introducing Godzilla's archenemy and the main antagonist of the film series, [[King Ghidorah]]. The films ''Son of Godzilla'' and ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' were aimed at youthful audiences, featuring the appearance of Godzilla's son, [[Minilla]]. ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' was notable for introducing Godzilla's robot duplicate and the secondary antagonist of the film series, [[Mechagodzilla]]. The Sh\u014dwa period loosely tied in to a number of Toho-produced films in which Godzilla himself did not appear and consequently saw the addition of many monsters into the ''Godzilla'' continuity, three of which ([[Rodan]], [[Varan]], and [[Mothra]]) originated in their own solo movies and another five ([[Anguirus]], [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]], [[Baragon]], [[Gorosaurus]] and [[Kumonga]]) appeared in their first films as either secondary antagonists or secondary kaiju.\n\n[[Haruo Nakajima]] mainly portrayed Godzilla since 1954 until his retirement in 1972. However, other stunt actors have portrayed the character in his absence, such as [[Katsumi Tezuka]], Y\u016b Sekida, Ryosaku Takasugi, Seiji Onaka, Shinji Takagi, Isao Zushi, and [[Toru Kawai]].<ref name=\"Godzilla\">{{cite video|people=Takeo Murata (writer) and Ishir\u014d Honda (writer/director)|title=[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Am.

His protege Sadamasa Arikawa took over the effects work for the next three films (with Tsuburaya supervising), while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] directed the special effects for the last six films of the series. [[The Criterion Collection]] released the Sh\u014dwa era films as part of a Blu-ray box set in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2019.<ref name=\"Criterion Set\"/>\n\n===Heisei era (1984\u20131995)===\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'', starting the second era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the ''Heisei'' series.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} ''The Return of Godzilla'' serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Showa era. ''The Return of Godzilla'' was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}}\n\nThe Heisei films are set in a single timeline, with each film providing continuity to the other films, and brings Godzilla back as a destructive force of nature that is feared by humans.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} The biological nature and science behind Godzilla became a much more discussed issue in the films, showing the increased focus on the moral aspects of genetics.

The film utilized a majority of the footage from the Japanese original, but a majority of the political themes and social commentaries were removed, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese original replaced with new scenes shot exclusively for the film featuring Raymond Burr as American journalist Steve Martin interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, sound effects and the soundtrack were tweaked and some dialogue was dubbed into English. \n\nIn 1957, producer Harry Rybnick attempted to produce a Hollywood-made alteration of ''Godzilla Raids Again'' titled ''The Volcano Monsters'', using some of the Japanese footage from the former to make a totally different film; however, funding from AB-PT Pictures collapsed after the company closed down and ''Godzilla Raids Again'' was instead dubbed in English and released in 1959 by [[Warner Bros.]] as ''Gigantis the Fire Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/the-first-hollywood-attempt-to-re-imagine-godzilla-ha-1573231492|title=The First Hollywood Attempt to \"Reimagine\" Godzilla Happened Back in 1957|last=Lizardman|work=Observation Deck|date=May 7, 2014| access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSimilar \"Americanizations\" occurred for the North American releases of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla 1985]],'' the latter which included Burr reprising his role of American journalist Steve Martin.\n\nIn 1976, Italian director [[Luigi Cozzi]] intended to re-release ''Godzilla'' in Italy. Facing resistance from exhibitors to showing a black-and-white film, Cozzi instead licensed a negative of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' from Toho and created a new movie in color, adding lots of stock footage of graphic death and destruction and short scenes from newsreel footage from World War II, which he released as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!#\"Cozzilla\"|Godzilla]]'' in 1977. The film was colorized using a process called Spectrorama 70, where color gels are put on the original black-and-white film, becoming one of the first black-and-white movies to be colorized. Dialogue was dubbed into Italian and new music was added. After the initial Italian run, the negative became Toho's property and prints have only been exhibited in Italy from that time onward.

The company created different series for different age groups, the [[Godzilla (Scott Ciencin series)|Scott Ciencin series]] being aimed at preteens and the [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|Marc Cerasini series]] being aimed at teens and young adults. Several [[manga]] have been derived from specific ''Godzilla'' films and both [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] have published ''Godzilla'' comic book series (1977\u20131979 and 1987\u20131999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series, ''Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters'' (published in book form under the same title), rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, ''Godzilla'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster'') and ''Godzilla: Rulers of Earth'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 1'' and ''Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 2''), as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.\n\nTo tie-in with the 2014 film, three books were published. [[Titan Books]] published a novelization of the movie in May 2014, written by Greg Cox. The graphic novel ''Godzilla: Awakening'' by Max Borenstein, Greg Borenstein and Eric Battle served as a prequel, and ''Godzilla: The Art of Destruction'' by Mark Cotta told about the making of the movie. Godzilla has been referenced in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' comics on three separate occasions. The character is featured in ''Bart Simpson's Guide to Life'' where it and other kaiju characters such as [[Minilla]] and [[King Ghidorah]] can be seen; it is featured in the comic \"''An Anime Among Us!''\" and ''K-Bart''.  Godzilla is also featured in the comic ''Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror 7'' where it and other kaiju can be seen referenced on the front cover. Godzilla has also been referenced in Marc Brown's ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' adventure book called ''Arthur's April Fool'', where Francine told Arthur and Buster that they need to pick on someone their own size, like Godzilla. Both [[Godzilla]] and [[Arthur Read|Arthur]] became the two of the most popular characters to root for.\n\n===Music===\n''[[Godzilla: The Album]]'', the [[soundtrack album]] of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), sold 2.5{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dud 'Godzilla' Still Music To Sony's Ears |url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-22/news/25735413_1_music-sales-soundtrack-albums-biggest-album |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922112642/http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-22/news/25735413_1_music-sales-soundtrack-albums-biggest-album |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 22, 2015 | access-date=September 22, 2015 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 22, 1998}}</ref> The album's lead single, \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come with Me]]\" by [[Puff Daddy]] featuring [[Jimmy Page]], sold a certified 2.025{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide.<ref>See {{Section link|Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Certifications}}</ref> Its Japan-exclusive single, \"[[Shinshoku (Lose Control)|Lose Control]]\" by [[Japanese rock]] band [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], sold 938,401 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shinshoku ~Lose Control~ |url=http://www.generasia.com/wiki/Shinshoku_~Lose_Control~ |website=Generasia | access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Shin Godzilla|Shin Godzilla Ongakushuu]]'', the soundtrack album of ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'' (2016), sold 43,951 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=2016 Oricon Top 100 Albums |url=http://www.generasia.com/wiki/2016_Oricon_Top_100_Albums |website=Generasia | access-date=August 19, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> ''[[Mars (B'z album)|Mars]]'' (1991), an album by the Japanese rock duo [[B'z]] featuring a Godzilla-themed song, sold 1,730,500 copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |title=B'z\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u8a18\u9332\u66f4\u65b0\u3078\uff01\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01 |url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/21023/full/ |work=[[Oricon News]] |publisher=[[Oricon]] |date=2006-05-10 |language=ja-JP}}</ref>\n\n[[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]] released the song \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\" in 1977.

The British band [[Lostprophets]] released a song called \"[[We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan]]\" on its second studio album ''[[Start Something]]''. The American punk band [[Groovie Ghoulies]] released a song called \"Hats off to You (Godzilla)\" as a tribute to Godzilla.

The record label Shifty issued the compilation album ''Destroysall'' with 15 songs from 15 bands, ranging from hardcore punk to doom-laden death metal. Not all of the songs are dedicated to Godzilla, but all do appear connected to monsters from Toho Studios. Fittingly, the disc was released on August 1, 2003, the 35th anniversary of the Japanese release of ''Destroy All Monsters''.\n\nKing Geedorah (a.k.a. [[MF Doom|MF DOOM]]) released ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'', a hip-hop album featuring guests from the group [[Monsta Island Czars]], another Godzilla-themed hip-hop group.

The songs are titled \"Sad Kaiju\", \"Mothra\", and \"Sludge\", respectively. The monsters are also mentioned by name on the track \"News at Six\" in which they are comically described by newscaster Chip Bentley as destroying a nearby town. The band has mentioned in interviews that they have also written songs based on Biollante, King Ghidorah, and Rodan as well.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{Main|Godzilla in popular culture}}\n\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of [[Japanese popular culture]] worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the [[Kaij\u016b|kaiju]] subset of the [[tokusatsu]] genre. It has been considered a filmographic [[metaphor]] for the United States (with the \"[[-zilla]]\" part of the name being used in vernacular language as a suffix to indicate something of exaggerated proportions), as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier ''Godzilla'' films, especially the original ''Godzilla'', portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] and the possibility of recurrence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/popcult/handouts/metaphor/godzilla/godzilla.html |title=The Monster That Morphed Into a Metaphor |author=Terrence Rafferty |date=May 2, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nAt least two [[prehistoric creatures]] from the [[fossil record]] have been named after Godzilla.

With television and film technology booming there was demand for high fidelity microphones and greater directionality. [[Electro-Voice]] responded with their Academy Award-winning [[shotgun microphone]] in 1963.\n \nDuring the second half of 20th century development advanced quickly with the [[Shure]] Brothers bringing out the [[Shure SM58|SM58]] and [[Shure SM57|SM57]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Shure Americas |url=http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history |title=History \u2013 The evolution of an audio revolution |accessdate=13 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915095300/http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref> The latest research developments include the use of fibre optics, lasers and interferometers.\n\n==Components==\n[[File:MicrophoneSymbol.png|thumb|Electronic symbol for a microphone]]\nThe sensitive transducer element of a microphone is called its ''element'' or ''capsule.'' Sound is first converted to mechanical motion by means of a diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A [[wireless microphone]] contains a [[radio transmitter]].\n\n== Varieties ==\nMicrophones are categorized by their [[transducer]] principle, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., and by their directional characteristics. Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.\n\n{{Anchor|Condenser microphone}}<!--linked from redirects [[Condenser microphone]], [[Consensor microphone]], [[Condenser mic]] etc. Take care when editing anchor-->\n\n=== Condenser ===\n[[File:Oktava319-internal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inside the Oktava 319 condenser microphone]]\n\nThe '''condenser microphone''', invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm |title= Bell Laboratories and The Development of Electrical Recording |publisher=Stokowski.org (Leopold Stokowski site)}}</ref> is also called a '''capacitor microphone''' or '''electrostatic microphone'''\u2014capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] acts as one plate of a [[capacitor]], and the vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the [[audio signal]] from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a '''DC-biased microphone''', the plates are [[Voltage bias|biased]] with a fixed charge (''Q''). The [[voltage]] maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = {{fract|Q|V}}), where Q = charge in [[coulomb]]s, C = capacitance in [[farad]]s and V = potential difference in [[volt]]s.  The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an \"element\" or \"capsule\".\n\nA nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100&nbsp;[[Farad|pF]]) and the value of the bias resistor (100&nbsp;[[ohm|M\u03a9]] to tens of G\u03a9) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an [[RC circuit]] equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.\n\nWithin the time-frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50&nbsp;ms at 20&nbsp;Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.\n\n[[Image:AKG C451B.jpg|thumb|right|[[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C451B small-diaphragm condenser microphone]]\n'''RF condenser microphones''' use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a [[resonant circuit]] that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The [[Sennheiser]] \"MKH\" series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energised [[The Thing (listening device)|application of the same physical principle]] was devised by Soviet Russian inventor [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] and used to bug the US Ambassador's Residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.\n\nCondenser microphones span the range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and [[recording studio]] applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as [[phantom power]] or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the [[R\u00f8de]] NT2000 or CAD M179.\n\nA [[valve microphone]] is a condenser microphone that uses a [[vacuum tube]] (valve) amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Institute BV Amsterdam| first=SAE|title=Microphones |url=http://www.sae.edu/reference_material/audio/pages/Microphones.htm|publisher=Practical Creative Media Education|accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> They remain popular with enthusiasts of [[tube sound]].\n\n==== Electret condenser ====\n{{Main|Electret microphone}}\n[[Image:US Patent 3118022 - Gerhard M.

An [[electret]] is a [[ferroelectric]] material that has been permanently [[electric charge|electrically charged]] or ''polarized''. The name comes from ''electr''ostatic and magn''et''; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a [[permanent magnet]] is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.\n\nDue to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045334/http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html |archive-date=August 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |title=Integrated Circuits for High Performance Electret Microphones |author=Arie Van Rhijn |publisher=National Semiconductor}}</ref>  They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and [[lavalier microphone|lavalier]] use to built-in microphones in small [[sound recording]] devices and telephones. Prior to the proliferation of MEMS microphones,<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Integrated Interfaces for MEMS Microphones |author1=Piero Malcovati |author2=Andrea Baschirotto |doi=10.3390/mi9070323 |pmid=30424256 |pmc=6082321 |journal= Micromachines|volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=323 |year=2018 }}</ref> nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones were electret types.  \n\nUnlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated [[Microphone preamplifier|preamplifier]] that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently [[phantom power]]ed in [[sound reinforcement]] and studio applications. Monophonic microphones designed for [[personal computer]]s (PCs), sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5&nbsp;mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5&nbsp;V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.\n\nThough electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Only the best electret microphones rival good DC-polarized units in terms of noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive mass-production, while inherently expensive non-electret condenser microphones are made to higher quality.\n\n{{Anchor|Dynamic microphone}}<!-- redirects link here [[Dynamic microphone]] [[Moving-coil microphone]] -->\n\n=== Dynamic ===\n[[Image:Patti Smith performing in Finland, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Patti Smith]] singing into a [[Shure SM58]] (dynamic cardioid type) microphone]]\n\nThe '''dynamic microphone''' (also known as the '''moving-coil microphone''') works via [[electromagnetic induction]]. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high [[gain before feedback]], makes them ideal for on-stage use.\n\nDynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a [[loudspeaker]], only reversed. A small movable [[induction coil]], positioned in the [[magnetic field]] of a [[permanent magnet]], is attached to the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying [[current (electricity)|current]] in the coil through [[electromagnetic induction]]. A single dynamic membrane does not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. For this reason, some microphones utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult; designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. On the other hand, there are several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. The [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] D112, for example, is designed for bass response rather than treble.<ref>[http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,261,pid,261,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html \"AKG D 112 \u2013 Large-diaphragm dynamic microphone for bass instruments]\"</ref> In audio engineering several kinds of microphones are often used at the same time to get the best results.\n\n=== Ribbon ===\n{{main|Ribbon microphone}}\n[[Image:Edmund Lowe fsa 8b06653.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edmund Lowe]] using a ribbon microphone]]\n\n[[Ribbon microphone]]s use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a [[#Bi-directional|bi-directional]] (also called figure-eight, as in the [[#Microphone polar patterns|diagram]] below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides.  Also, because the ribbon has much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the [[sound pressure]]. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or [[Blumlein Pair|Blumlein pair]], stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.\n\nOther directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone]] has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from \"figure-eight\" to \"unidirectional\". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high-quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials,<ref>{{cite journal\n |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2008/02/11/story8.html\n |title=Local firms strum the chords of real music innovation\n |journal=Mass High Tech: The Journal of New England Technology\n |date=February 8, 2008\n}}</ref> have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require [[phantom power]]; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, ''i.e.'', those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.\n\n=== Carbon ===\n{{Main|Carbon microphone}}\n\nThe [[carbon microphone]] was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the [[Emile Berliner|Berliner]] and [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Boudet%20Microphone\n |title=Boudet's Microphone\n |publisher=Machine-History.com\n |access-date=2009-12-09\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822100052/http://www.machine-history.com/Boudet%20Microphone\n |archive-date=2015-08-22\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nUnlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early [[repeater|telephone repeaters]], making long-distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. Called a Brown's relay,{{cn|reason=Apprently for [[Sidney Brown]] but I can't find a supporting ref that indicates he worked on this problem or that it was given his name.|date=January 2020}} these repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old \"candlestick\" telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.\n\n{{Anchor|Piezoelectric microphone}}<!--Redirects link here [[Piezoelectric microphone]]-->\n\n=== Piezoelectric ===\n[[Image:Astatic crystal mic.jpg|thumb|Vintage [[Astatic Corporation|Astatic]] crystal microphone]]\nA '''crystal microphone''' or '''piezo microphone'''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seung S.

An example of this is [[potassium sodium tartrate]], which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with [[vacuum tube]] (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders.  Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10&nbsp;[[Ohm|megohms]]) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early [[transistor]] equipment and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.\n\nPiezoelectric transducers are often used as [[contact microphone]]s to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits, for triggering electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|Saddle-mounted pickups]] on [[acoustic guitar]]s are generally piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|magnetic coil pickups]] commonly visible on typical [[electric guitar]]s, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.\n\n=== Fiber-optic ===\n[[Image:Optimic1140 fiber optical microphone for wiki.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Optoacoustics Ltd|Optoacoustics]] 1140 fiber-optic microphone]]\n\nA [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Paritsky |author2=Kots, A. |title=Fiber optic microphone as a realization of fiber optic positioning sensors |journal=Proc.

Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber-optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.\n\nFiber-optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI/RFI]] immunity). The fiber-optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside [[Gas turbine#Industrial gas turbines for electrical generation|industrial turbines]] or in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) equipment environments.\n\nFiber-optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or [[impedance matching]]. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber-optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.\n\nFiber-optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for [[infrasound]] monitoring and [[Noise-canceling microphone|noise-canceling]]. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content=9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |title=Case Study: Can You Hear Me Now? |work=rt-image.com |publisher=Valley Forge Publishing |first=Susan |last=Karlin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715212557/http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content%3D9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and  audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goulde|first1=Berg|title=Microphones For Computer|url=https://microphonetopgear.com/microphones-for-computer/|website=Microphone top gear|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Laser ===\n{{Main|Laser microphone}}\n\n[[Laser microphone]]s are often portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, because they can be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.\n\nIn a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an [[interferometer]], which detects movement of the surface by changes in the [[optical path length]] of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.\n\nA new type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect [[sound]] [[vibration]]s in free air. On 25 August 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through 12 October 2009.\n\n=== Liquid ===\n{{Main|Water microphone}}\n\nEarly microphones did not produce intelligible speech, until [[Alexander Graham Bell]] made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter.  Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle.  [[Elisha Gray]] filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle.{{when|date=February 2019}}  Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application.  The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.\n\n=== MEMS ===\n{{main|Microelectromechanical systems}}\n\nThe [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cirrus-logic-completes-acquisition-of-wolfson-microelectronics-2014-08-21|title=Cirrus Logic Completes Acquisition of Wolfson Microelectronics |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2014-08-21 }}</ref> InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/en/about-adi/news-room/press-releases/2013/10_14_13_adi_to_sell_microphone_product_line_to_in.html|title=Analog Devices To Sell Microphone Product Line To InvenSense |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2015-11-27 }}</ref>), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles <ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor.knowles.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=252194&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1884042|title=Knowles Completes Acquisition of NXP's Sound Solutions Business |publisher=Knowles |accessdate=2011-07-05 }}</ref>), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/157790-mems-microphone-will-be-hurt-by-downturn-in-smartphone-market |title=MEMS Microphone Will Be Hurt by Downturn in Smartphone Market |publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]] |accessdate=2009-08-23 }}</ref> and Omron.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omron.com/media/press/2009/11/c1125.html |title=OMRON to Launch Mass-production and Supply of MEMS Acoustic Sensor Chip -World's first MEMS sensor capable of detecting the lower limit of human audible frequencies- |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref>\n\nMore recently, since the 2010s, there has been increased interest and research into making piezoelectric MEMS microphones which are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser style MEMS designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1324827|title=MEMS Mics Taking Over|work=EETimes}}</ref>\n\n=== Speakers as microphones ===\nA [[loudspeaker]], a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed much like a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work \"in reverse\" as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as [[intercom]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s or [[Voice chat#Voice chat in gaming|video game voice chat]] peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.\n\nHowever, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size [[woofer]] placed closely in front of a \"kick drum\" ([[bass drum]]) in a [[drum set]] to act as a microphone.  A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a {{convert|6.5|in|adj=on}} woofer shock-mounted into a 10\" drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. \n\nLess commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a [[tweeter]] is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.\nMy friend's microphone doesn't work.\n\n== Capsule design and directivity ==\nThe inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bartlett  | first = Bruce  | title = How A Cardioid Microphone Works | url = http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/church_sound_how_a_cardioid_microphone_really_works/ }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Microphone polar patterns|patterns}}\n\n== Polar patterns ==\nMicrophone polar sensitivity. Microphone is facing towards the top of the page in diagram, parallel to the page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://microphonegeeks.com/different-microphone-polar-patterns/ |title=Understanding different microphone polar patterns |date=March 28, 2015 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\">\nImage:Polar pattern omnidirectional.svg|<center>Omnidirectional</center>\nImage:Polar pattern figure eight.svg|<center>Bi-directional or Figure of 8</center>\nImage:Polar pattern subcardioid.svg|<center>Subcardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern cardioid.svg|<center>[[Cardioid]]</center>\nImage:Polar pattern hypercardioid.svg|<center>Hypercardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern supercardioid.svg|<center>Supercardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern directional.svg|<center>Lobar</center>\n</gallery>\n\nA microphone's directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis.  The polar patterns illustrated above represent the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually [[perpendicular]] to the microphone body, commonly known as \"side fire\" or \"side address\". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as \"end fire\" or \"top/end address\".\n\nSome microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.\n\n===Omnidirectional===\nAn '''omnidirectional''' (or nondirectional) microphone's response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an \"omnidirectional\" microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.\n\nThe wavelength of sound at 10&nbsp;kHz is 1.4\" (3.5&nbsp;cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4\" (6&nbsp;mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the \"purest\" microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.\n\nAreas of application: studios, old churches, theatres, on-site TV interviews, etc.<ref>[https://micspeech.com/types-of-microphones/ Types of microphones.] Micspeech.</ref>\n\nAn example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black ''eight ball''.<ref>[http://lloydmicrophoneclassics.com/mic_history.html History & Development of Microphone.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704172711/http://lloydmicrophoneclassics.com/mic_history.html |date=2008-07-04 }} Lloyd Microphone Classics.</ref>\n\n===Unidirectional===\nA unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. [[#Microphone polar patterns|The diagram above]] (shotgun) illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360\u00b0. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)\n\n{{Anchor|Cardioid}}\n\n===Cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid===\n[[Image:Us664a microphone.jpg|thumb|right|University Sound US664A dynamic supercardioid microphone]]\n\nThe most common unidirectional microphone is a '''cardioid''' microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is \"heart-shaped\", i.e. a [[cardioid]]. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone, which is the \"stem\" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]]. Since these directional [[transducer]] microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]].<ref>[http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/node473.html Proximity Effect.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016054151/http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/node473.html |date=2007-10-16 }} Geoff Martin, ''Introduction to Sound Recording''.</ref> The [[SM58]] has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history/index.htm |title=History \u2013 The evolution of an audio revolution |publisher=[[Shure]] |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref> demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.\n\nThe cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone;<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KApvYcQkY_gC|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround \u2013 A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|last=Rayburn|first=Ray A.|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781136118135|language=en}}</ref> for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other.\n\nBy combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family.

Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern.  In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the ''change'' in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are [[Gradient vector|vector]] transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.\n\n{{anchor|Shotgun and parabolic microphones|shotgun}}\n\n===Shotgun===\n[[Image:shotgun microphone.jpg|thumb|right|An Audio-Technica shotgun microphone]]\n[[File:Interference Tube.jpg|thumb|right|The interference tube of a shotgun microphone. The capsule is at the base of the tube.]]\n\n'''Shotgun microphones''' are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types.  At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects.  Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.\n\n===Boundary or \"PZM\"===\nSeveral approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary.<ref>({{Cite patent|US|4361736}})</ref> While the patent has expired, \"Pressure Zone Microphone\" and \"PZM\" are still active trademarks of [[Crown International]], and the generic term [[boundary microphone]] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is \"Phase Coherent Cardioid\" or \"PCC,\" but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.\n\n== Application-specific designs ==\nA [[lavalier microphone]] is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).\n\nA [[wireless microphone]] transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. It usually sends its signal using a small FM radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared waves if the transmitter and receiver are within sight of each other.\n\nA [[contact microphone]] picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or [[insect]]s. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A [[throat microphone]] is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.\n\n[[File:Sony parabolic reflector.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sony parabolic reflector, without a microphone. The microphone would face the reflector surface and sound captured by the reflector would bounce towards the microphone.]]\nA [[parabolic microphone]] uses a [[parabolic reflector]] to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a [[parabolic antenna]] (e.g. [[satellite dish]]) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, [[eavesdropping]], [[Police|law enforcement]], and even [[espionage]]. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.\n\nA stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for [[broadcast]] applications or [[field recording]] where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see [[microphone practice]]) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.\n\nA [[noise-canceling microphone]] is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments.  One such use is in [[aircraft]] cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in [[live event support]] on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with [[Concert|live performances]]. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16&nbsp;dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Janet Jackson]].<ref>[http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/mics/136368.pdf Crown Audio.

By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.\n\n== Powering ==\nMicrophones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [[:de:Tonaderspeisung]] or T-power and DIN 45596 for [[phantom power]]. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, \"plug-in power\" is more common, for microphones using a 3.5&nbsp;mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Multimedia systems \u2013 Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability|journal=Webstore.iec.ch|volume=IEC 61938:2013|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Connectors ==\n[[File:Yeti-USB-Microphone.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Blue Microphones|Blue]] Yeti with a USB connector (not visible)]]\n\nThe most common connectors used by microphones are:\n*Male [[XLR connector]] on professional microphones\n*\u00bc&nbsp;inch (sometimes referred to as 6.35&nbsp;mm) [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]] on less expensive musician's microphones, using an unbalanced 1/4&nbsp;inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) TS (tip and sleeve) phone connector. Harmonica microphones commonly use a high impedance 1/4&nbsp;inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) TS connection to be run through guitar amplifiers.\n*[[Phone connector (audio)#Miniature size|3.5&nbsp;mm]] (sometimes referred to as 1/8&nbsp;inch mini) TRS (tip, ring and sleeve) stereo (also available as TS mono) mini phone plug on prosumer camera, recorder and computer microphones.\n*[[USB]] allows direct connection to PCs. Electronics in these microphones powered over the USB connection performs preamplification and ADC before the digital audio data is transferred via the USB interface.\n\nSome microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or \"lapel\", from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporter's suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a [[radio pack]]. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.\n\n=== Impedance-matching ===\nMicrophones have an electrical characteristic called [[electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s&nbsp;(\u03a9), that depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value relates to the impedance of the coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the load impedance for which its amplifier circuitry is designed. Typically, the ''rated impedance'' is stated.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">International Standard IEC 60268-4</ref> Low impedance is considered under 600&nbsp;\u03a9. Medium impedance is considered between 600&nbsp;\u03a9 and 10&nbsp;k\u03a9. High impedance is above 10&nbsp;k\u03a9. Owing to their built-in [[Electronic amplifier|amplifier]], condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200&nbsp;\u03a9.<ref name=Eargle2002>{{cite book |title=Audio Engineering for Sound Reinforcement |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M. Eargle |author2=Chris Foreman |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |location=Milwaukee |isbn=978-0-634-04355-0 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWzZe6z4xdAC }}</ref>\n\nIf a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200&nbsp;\u03a9 or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a [[transformer]] that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available that can be used in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.\n\nLow-impedance microphones are preferred over high impedance for two reasons: one is that using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance{{citation needed|reason=Unless there is an IEEE specification that states specific audio input and output impedances for all equipment, this is an over-reaching statement that might not always (or frequently) be true.|date=September 2015}}. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more [[mains hum|hum]] (and possibly [[Radio frequency interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.\n\nSome microphones are designed ''not'' to have their impedance matched by the load they are connected to.<ref>[http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428071840/http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance|date=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.<ref>Robertson, A. E.: \"Microphones\" Illiffe Press for BBC, 1951\u20131963</ref>{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Digital microphone interface ===\n[[File:Neumann D-01 IBC 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Neumann D-01 digital microphone and Neumann DMI-8 8-channel USB Digital Microphone Interface]]\nThe [[AES42]] standard, published by the [[Audio Engineering Society]], defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or [[XLR connector#XLD keyed variant|XLD]] male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.\n\n== Measurements and specifications ==\n[[Image:Oktava319vsshuresm58.png|thumb|left|A comparison of the far field on-axis frequency response of the Oktava 319 and the [[SM58|Shure SM58]]]]\n\nBecause of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform [[phase (waves)|phase]] and [[frequency]] responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070210000128/http://www.microphone-data.com/]. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC&nbsp;60268-4.\n\nA [[frequency response]] diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in [[decibel]]s over a range of frequencies (typically 20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0\u00b0 to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: \"30&nbsp;Hz\u201316&nbsp;kHz&nbsp;\u00b13&nbsp;dB\". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3&nbsp;dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how ''smooth'' the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as \"20&nbsp;Hz\u201320&nbsp;kHz\" are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC&nbsp;60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in ''plane progressive wave'' conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. ''Close talking'' microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.\n\nThe self-noise or [[equivalent input]] noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in [[dB(A)]], which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: \"15&nbsp;dBA SPL\" (SPL means [[sound pressure]] level relative to 20&nbsp;[[micropascal]]s). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]], which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11\u201314&nbsp;dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20&nbsp;dBA SPL or 32&nbsp;dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Br\u00fcel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0&nbsp;dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from [[Georg Neumann GmbH|Neumann]] and [[R\u00f8de]] that advertise noise levels between 5\u20137&nbsp;dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the [[A-weighting]] curve while broadband noise may be increased.\n\nThe maximum SPL the microphone can accept is measured for particular values of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD), typically 0.5%. This amount of distortion is generally inaudible,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} so one can safely use the microphone at this SPL without harming the recording. Example: \"142&nbsp;[[dB SPL]] peak (at 0.5%&nbsp;THD)\". The higher the value, the better, although microphones with a very high maximum SPL also have a higher self-noise.\n\nThe clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1%&nbsp;THD figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.\n\nThe dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example \"120&nbsp;dB\", it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.\n\n[[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device.  This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, \"transduction gain\" being perhaps more meaningful, (or just \"output level\") because true sensitivity is generally set by the [[noise floor]], and too much \"sensitivity\" in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1&nbsp;kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1&nbsp;V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so \u221260&nbsp; dB is more sensitive than \u221270&nbsp;dB.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Measurement microphones ==<!--[[Measurement microphone]] redirects here-->\n[[Image:AKG C214 condenser microphone with H85 shock mount.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C214 condenser microphone with [[shock mount]]]]\nSome microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations \"Class 1,\" \"Type 2\" etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to [[sound level meter]]s.<ref>IEC Standard 61672 and ANSI S1.4</ref> A more comprehensive standard<ref>IEC 61094</ref> for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.\n\nMeasurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of [[pressure]]; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. [[Sound intensity]] or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with [[Hot-wire anemometry|hot-wire anemometers]].\n\n===Calibration===\n{{Main|Measurement microphone calibration}}\n\nTo take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in [[volt]]s per [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly [[Calibration|calibrate]] measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All [[measurement microphone calibration|microphone calibration]] is ultimately traceable to [[primary standard]]s at a national measurement institute such as [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] in the UK, [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] in Germany and [[NIST]] in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.\n\nDepending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.\n\n== Arrays ==\n{{Main|Microphone array}}\n\nA microphone array is any number of microphones operating in [[tandem]]. There are many applications:\n\n*Systems for extracting voice input from [[ambient noise level|ambient noise]] (notably [[telephone]]s, [[speech recognition]] systems, [[hearing aid]]s)\n*[[Surround sound]] and related technologies\n*Locating objects by sound: [[acoustic source localization]], ''e.g.'', military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.\n*[[High fidelity]] original recordings\n*3D spatial [[beamforming]] for localized acoustic detection of [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] sounds\n\nTypically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the [[perimeter]] of a space, linked to a [[computer]] that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.\n\n{{Anchor|Microphone windscreens}}\n\n== Windscreens ==\n[[File:Microphone and cover.JPG|thumb|Microphone with its windscreen removed.]]\n{{see also|Pop filter}}\n'''Windscreens''' (or windshields \u2013 the terms are interchangeable) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam \"hats\" shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.\n\nThe shielding material used \u2013 wire gauze, fabric or foam \u2013 is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.\n\nSince all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://www.ips.org.uk/files/03_Blasted_Microphones.pdf\n  |title=Blasted microphones \n}}</ref> With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke,<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://www.filmebase.pt/Wind.html\n  |title=Joerg Wuttke \u2013 Microphones and Wind \n}}</ref> which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.\n\nSince turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://rycote.com/microphone-windshield-shock-mount/cyclone/\n  |title=Rycote Cyclone \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pop filter.jpg|thumb|Singer and disc [[pop filter]] in front of a large-diaphragm condenser mic]]\nIn the studio and on stage, pop-screens and foam shields can be useful for reasons of hygiene, and protecting microphones from spittle and sweat. They can also be useful coloured idents. On location the basket shield can contain a suspension system to isolate the microphone from shock and handling noise.\n\nStating the efficiency of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10\u2013100&nbsp;Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain \u2013 particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical \u201cwumping\u201d sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies \u2013 200&nbsp;Hz to ~3&nbsp;kHz \u2013 the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, even though it has a far lower energy content.

Microphones are used in many applications such as [[telephone]]s, [[hearing aid]]s, [[public address system]]s for concert halls and public events, [[motion picture]] production, live and recorded [[audio engineering]], [[sound recording]], [[two-way radio]]s, [[megaphone]]s,  [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, [[speech recognition]], [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or [[Automatic Performance Control|knock sensors]].\n\nSeveral types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a [[sound wave]] to an electrical signal.  The most common are the [[dynamic microphone]], which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the [[condenser microphone]], which uses the vibrating [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] as a [[capacitor]] plate; and the [[piezoelectric microphone]], which uses a crystal of [[piezoelectric]] material.  Microphones typically need to be connected to a [[preamplifier]] before the signal can be [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded or reproduced]].\n\n==History==\nIn order to speak to larger groups of people, a need arose to increase the volume of the human voice.

Sound is first converted to mechanical motion by means of a diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A [[wireless microphone]] contains a [[radio transmitter]].\n\n== Varieties ==\nMicrophones are categorized by their [[transducer]] principle, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., and by their directional characteristics. Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.\n\n{{Anchor|Condenser microphone}}<!--linked from redirects [[Condenser microphone]], [[Consensor microphone]], [[Condenser mic]] etc. Take care when editing anchor-->\n\n=== Condenser ===\n[[File:Oktava319-internal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inside the Oktava 319 condenser microphone]]\n\nThe '''condenser microphone''', invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm |title= Bell Laboratories and The Development of Electrical Recording |publisher=Stokowski.org (Leopold Stokowski site)}}</ref> is also called a '''capacitor microphone''' or '''electrostatic microphone'''\u2014capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] acts as one plate of a [[capacitor]], and the vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the [[audio signal]] from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a '''DC-biased microphone''', the plates are [[Voltage bias|biased]] with a fixed charge (''Q''). The [[voltage]] maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = {{fract|Q|V}}), where Q = charge in [[coulomb]]s, C = capacitance in [[farad]]s and V = potential difference in [[volt]]s.  The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an \"element\" or \"capsule\".\n\nA nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100&nbsp;[[Farad|pF]]) and the value of the bias resistor (100&nbsp;[[ohm|M\u03a9]] to tens of G\u03a9) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an [[RC circuit]] equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.\n\nWithin the time-frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50&nbsp;ms at 20&nbsp;Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.\n\n[[Image:AKG C451B.jpg|thumb|right|[[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C451B small-diaphragm condenser microphone]]\n'''RF condenser microphones''' use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a [[resonant circuit]] that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The [[Sennheiser]] \"MKH\" series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energised [[The Thing (listening device)|application of the same physical principle]] was devised by Soviet Russian inventor [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] and used to bug the US Ambassador's Residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.\n\nCondenser microphones span the range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and [[recording studio]] applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as [[phantom power]] or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the [[R\u00f8de]] NT2000 or CAD M179.\n\nA [[valve microphone]] is a condenser microphone that uses a [[vacuum tube]] (valve) amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Institute BV Amsterdam| first=SAE|title=Microphones |url=http://www.sae.edu/reference_material/audio/pages/Microphones.htm|publisher=Practical Creative Media Education|accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> They remain popular with enthusiasts of [[tube sound]].\n\n==== Electret condenser ====\n{{Main|Electret microphone}}\n[[Image:US Patent 3118022 - Gerhard M.

An [[electret]] is a [[ferroelectric]] material that has been permanently [[electric charge|electrically charged]] or ''polarized''. The name comes from ''electr''ostatic and magn''et''; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a [[permanent magnet]] is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.\n\nDue to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045334/http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html |archive-date=August 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |title=Integrated Circuits for High Performance Electret Microphones |author=Arie Van Rhijn |publisher=National Semiconductor}}</ref>  They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and [[lavalier microphone|lavalier]] use to built-in microphones in small [[sound recording]] devices and telephones. Prior to the proliferation of MEMS microphones,<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Integrated Interfaces for MEMS Microphones |author1=Piero Malcovati |author2=Andrea Baschirotto |doi=10.3390/mi9070323 |pmid=30424256 |pmc=6082321 |journal= Micromachines|volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=323 |year=2018 }}</ref> nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones were electret types.  \n\nUnlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated [[Microphone preamplifier|preamplifier]] that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently [[phantom power]]ed in [[sound reinforcement]] and studio applications. Monophonic microphones designed for [[personal computer]]s (PCs), sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5&nbsp;mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5&nbsp;V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.\n\nThough electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Only the best electret microphones rival good DC-polarized units in terms of noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive mass-production, while inherently expensive non-electret condenser microphones are made to higher quality.\n\n{{Anchor|Dynamic microphone}}<!-- redirects link here [[Dynamic microphone]] [[Moving-coil microphone]] -->\n\n=== Dynamic ===\n[[Image:Patti Smith performing in Finland, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Patti Smith]] singing into a [[Shure SM58]] (dynamic cardioid type) microphone]]\n\nThe '''dynamic microphone''' (also known as the '''moving-coil microphone''') works via [[electromagnetic induction]]. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high [[gain before feedback]], makes them ideal for on-stage use.\n\nDynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a [[loudspeaker]], only reversed. A small movable [[induction coil]], positioned in the [[magnetic field]] of a [[permanent magnet]], is attached to the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying [[current (electricity)|current]] in the coil through [[electromagnetic induction]]. A single dynamic membrane does not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. For this reason, some microphones utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult; designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. On the other hand, there are several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. The [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] D112, for example, is designed for bass response rather than treble.<ref>[http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,261,pid,261,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html \"AKG D 112 \u2013 Large-diaphragm dynamic microphone for bass instruments]\"</ref> In audio engineering several kinds of microphones are often used at the same time to get the best results.\n\n=== Ribbon ===\n{{main|Ribbon microphone}}\n[[Image:Edmund Lowe fsa 8b06653.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edmund Lowe]] using a ribbon microphone]]\n\n[[Ribbon microphone]]s use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a [[#Bi-directional|bi-directional]] (also called figure-eight, as in the [[#Microphone polar patterns|diagram]] below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides.  Also, because the ribbon has much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the [[sound pressure]]. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or [[Blumlein Pair|Blumlein pair]], stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.\n\nOther directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone]] has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from \"figure-eight\" to \"unidirectional\". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high-quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials,<ref>{{cite journal\n |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2008/02/11/story8.html\n |title=Local firms strum the chords of real music innovation\n |journal=Mass High Tech: The Journal of New England Technology\n |date=February 8, 2008\n}}</ref> have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require [[phantom power]]; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, ''i.e.'', those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.\n\n=== Carbon ===\n{{Main|Carbon microphone}}\n\nThe [[carbon microphone]] was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the [[Emile Berliner|Berliner]] and [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Boudet%20Microphone\n |title=Boudet's Microphone\n |publisher=Machine-History.com\n |access-date=2009-12-09\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822100052/http://www.machine-history.com/Boudet%20Microphone\n |archive-date=2015-08-22\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nUnlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early [[repeater|telephone repeaters]], making long-distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes.

One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old \"candlestick\" telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.\n\n{{Anchor|Piezoelectric microphone}}<!--Redirects link here [[Piezoelectric microphone]]-->\n\n=== Piezoelectric ===\n[[Image:Astatic crystal mic.jpg|thumb|Vintage [[Astatic Corporation|Astatic]] crystal microphone]]\nA '''crystal microphone''' or '''piezo microphone'''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seung S.

An example of this is [[potassium sodium tartrate]], which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with [[vacuum tube]] (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders.  Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10&nbsp;[[Ohm|megohms]]) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early [[transistor]] equipment and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.\n\nPiezoelectric transducers are often used as [[contact microphone]]s to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits, for triggering electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|Saddle-mounted pickups]] on [[acoustic guitar]]s are generally piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|magnetic coil pickups]] commonly visible on typical [[electric guitar]]s, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.\n\n=== Fiber-optic ===\n[[Image:Optimic1140 fiber optical microphone for wiki.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Optoacoustics Ltd|Optoacoustics]] 1140 fiber-optic microphone]]\n\nA [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Paritsky |author2=Kots, A. |title=Fiber optic microphone as a realization of fiber optic positioning sensors |journal=Proc.

Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber-optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.\n\nFiber-optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI/RFI]] immunity). The fiber-optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside [[Gas turbine#Industrial gas turbines for electrical generation|industrial turbines]] or in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) equipment environments.\n\nFiber-optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or [[impedance matching]]. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber-optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.\n\nFiber-optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for [[infrasound]] monitoring and [[Noise-canceling microphone|noise-canceling]]. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content=9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |title=Case Study: Can You Hear Me Now? |work=rt-image.com |publisher=Valley Forge Publishing |first=Susan |last=Karlin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715212557/http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content%3D9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and  audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goulde|first1=Berg|title=Microphones For Computer|url=https://microphonetopgear.com/microphones-for-computer/|website=Microphone top gear|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Laser ===\n{{Main|Laser microphone}}\n\n[[Laser microphone]]s are often portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, because they can be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.\n\nIn a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an [[interferometer]], which detects movement of the surface by changes in the [[optical path length]] of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.\n\nA new type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect [[sound]] [[vibration]]s in free air. On 25 August 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through 12 October 2009.\n\n=== Liquid ===\n{{Main|Water microphone}}\n\nEarly microphones did not produce intelligible speech, until [[Alexander Graham Bell]] made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter.  Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle.  [[Elisha Gray]] filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle.{{when|date=February 2019}}  Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application.  The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.\n\n=== MEMS ===\n{{main|Microelectromechanical systems}}\n\nThe [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cirrus-logic-completes-acquisition-of-wolfson-microelectronics-2014-08-21|title=Cirrus Logic Completes Acquisition of Wolfson Microelectronics |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2014-08-21 }}</ref> InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/en/about-adi/news-room/press-releases/2013/10_14_13_adi_to_sell_microphone_product_line_to_in.html|title=Analog Devices To Sell Microphone Product Line To InvenSense |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2015-11-27 }}</ref>), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles <ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor.knowles.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=252194&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1884042|title=Knowles Completes Acquisition of NXP's Sound Solutions Business |publisher=Knowles |accessdate=2011-07-05 }}</ref>), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/157790-mems-microphone-will-be-hurt-by-downturn-in-smartphone-market |title=MEMS Microphone Will Be Hurt by Downturn in Smartphone Market |publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]] |accessdate=2009-08-23 }}</ref> and Omron.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omron.com/media/press/2009/11/c1125.html |title=OMRON to Launch Mass-production and Supply of MEMS Acoustic Sensor Chip -World's first MEMS sensor capable of detecting the lower limit of human audible frequencies- |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref>\n\nMore recently, since the 2010s, there has been increased interest and research into making piezoelectric MEMS microphones which are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser style MEMS designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1324827|title=MEMS Mics Taking Over|work=EETimes}}</ref>\n\n=== Speakers as microphones ===\nA [[loudspeaker]], a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed much like a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work \"in reverse\" as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as [[intercom]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s or [[Voice chat#Voice chat in gaming|video game voice chat]] peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.\n\nHowever, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size [[woofer]] placed closely in front of a \"kick drum\" ([[bass drum]]) in a [[drum set]] to act as a microphone.  A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a {{convert|6.5|in|adj=on}} woofer shock-mounted into a 10\" drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. \n\nLess commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a [[tweeter]] is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.\n\n== Capsule design and directivity ==\nThe inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bartlett  | first = Bruce  | title = How A Cardioid Microphone Works | url = http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/church_sound_how_a_cardioid_microphone_really_works/ }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Microphone polar patterns|patterns}}\n\n== Polar patterns ==\nMicrophone polar sensitivity. Microphone is facing towards the top of the page in diagram, parallel to the page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://microphonegeeks.com/different-microphone-polar-patterns/ |title=Understanding different microphone polar patterns |date=March 28, 2015 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\">\nImage:Polar pattern omnidirectional.svg|<center>Omnidirectional</center>\nImage:Polar pattern figure eight.svg|<center>Bi-directional or Figure of 8</center>\nImage:Polar pattern subcardioid.svg|<center>Subcardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern cardioid.svg|<center>[[Cardioid]]</center>\nImage:Polar pattern hypercardioid.svg|<center>Hypercardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern supercardioid.svg|<center>Supercardioid</center>\nImage:Polar pattern directional.svg|<center>Lobar</center>\n</gallery>\n\nA microphone's directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis.  The polar patterns illustrated above represent the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually [[perpendicular]] to the microphone body, commonly known as \"side fire\" or \"side address\". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as \"end fire\" or \"top/end address\".\n\nSome microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.\n\n===Omnidirectional===\nAn '''omnidirectional''' (or nondirectional) microphone's response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an \"omnidirectional\" microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.\n\nThe wavelength of sound at 10&nbsp;kHz is 1.4\" (3.5&nbsp;cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4\" (6&nbsp;mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the \"purest\" microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.\n\nAreas of application: studios, old churches, theatres, on-site TV interviews, etc.<ref>[https://micspeech.com/types-of-microphones/ Types of microphones.] Micspeech.</ref>\n\nAn example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black ''eight ball''.<ref>[http://lloydmicrophoneclassics.com/mic_history.html History & Development of Microphone.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704172711/http://lloydmicrophoneclassics.com/mic_history.html |date=2008-07-04 }} Lloyd Microphone Classics.</ref>\n\n===Unidirectional===\nA unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. [[#Microphone polar patterns|The diagram above]] (shotgun) illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360\u00b0. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)\n\n{{Anchor|Cardioid}}\n\n===Cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid===\n[[Image:Us664a microphone.jpg|thumb|right|University Sound US664A dynamic supercardioid microphone]]\n\nThe most common unidirectional microphone is a '''cardioid''' microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is \"heart-shaped\", i.e. a [[cardioid]]. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone, which is the \"stem\" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]]. Since these directional [[transducer]] microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]].<ref>[http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/node473.html Proximity Effect.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016054151/http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/node473.html |date=2007-10-16 }} Geoff Martin, ''Introduction to Sound Recording''.</ref> The [[SM58]] has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history/index.htm |title=History \u2013 The evolution of an audio revolution |publisher=[[Shure]] |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref> demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.\n\nThe cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone;<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KApvYcQkY_gC|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround \u2013 A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|last=Rayburn|first=Ray A.|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781136118135|language=en}}</ref> for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other.\n\nBy combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family.  Common shapes include:\n\n* A '''hyper-cardioid''' microphone is similar to cardioid, but with a slightly larger figure-8 contribution, leading to a tighter area of front sensitivity and a smaller lobe of rear sensitivity.  It is produced by combining the two components in a 3:1 ratio, producing nulls at 109.5\u00b0.  This ratio maximizes the [[directivity factor]] (or directivity index).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=On the Design and Implementation of Higher Order Differential Microphones \u2013 IEEE Journals & Magazine|issue=1|pages=162\u2013174|journal=IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing|volume=20|language=en-US|doi=10.1109/TASL.2011.2159204|date=January 2012|last1=Sena|first1=E.

Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern.  In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the ''change'' in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are [[Gradient vector|vector]] transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.\n\n{{anchor|Shotgun and parabolic microphones|shotgun}}\n\n===Shotgun===\n[[Image:shotgun microphone.jpg|thumb|right|An Audio-Technica shotgun microphone]]\n[[File:Interference Tube.jpg|thumb|right|The interference tube of a shotgun microphone. The capsule is at the base of the tube.]]\n\n'''Shotgun microphones''' are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types.  At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects.  Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.\n\n===Boundary or \"PZM\"===\nSeveral approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary.<ref>({{Cite patent|US|4361736}})</ref> While the patent has expired, \"Pressure Zone Microphone\" and \"PZM\" are still active trademarks of [[Crown International]], and the generic term [[boundary microphone]] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is \"Phase Coherent Cardioid\" or \"PCC,\" but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.\n\n== Application-specific designs ==\nA [[lavalier microphone]] is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).\n\nA [[wireless microphone]] transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. It usually sends its signal using a small FM radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared waves if the transmitter and receiver are within sight of each other.\n\nA [[contact microphone]] picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or [[insect]]s. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A [[throat microphone]] is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.\n\n[[File:Sony parabolic reflector.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sony parabolic reflector, without a microphone. The microphone would face the reflector surface and sound captured by the reflector would bounce towards the microphone.]]\nA [[parabolic microphone]] uses a [[parabolic reflector]] to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a [[parabolic antenna]] (e.g. [[satellite dish]]) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, [[eavesdropping]], [[Police|law enforcement]], and even [[espionage]]. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.\n\nA stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for [[broadcast]] applications or [[field recording]] where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see [[microphone practice]]) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.\n\nA [[noise-canceling microphone]] is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments.  One such use is in [[aircraft]] cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in [[live event support]] on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with [[Concert|live performances]]. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16&nbsp;dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Janet Jackson]].<ref>[http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/mics/136368.pdf Crown Audio.

By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.\n\n== Powering ==\nMicrophones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [[:de:Tonaderspeisung]] or T-power and DIN 45596 for [[phantom power]]. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, \"plug-in power\" is more common, for microphones using a 3.5&nbsp;mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Multimedia systems \u2013 Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability|journal=Webstore.iec.ch|volume=IEC 61938:2013|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Connectors ==\n[[File:Yeti-USB-Microphone.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Blue Microphones|Blue]] Yeti with a USB connector (not visible)]]\n\nThe most common connectors used by microphones are:\n*Male [[XLR connector]] on professional microphones\n*\u00bc&nbsp;inch (sometimes referred to as 6.35&nbsp;mm) [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]] on less expensive musician's microphones, using an unbalanced 1/4&nbsp;inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) TS (tip and sleeve) phone connector. Harmonica microphones commonly use a high impedance 1/4&nbsp;inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) TS connection to be run through guitar amplifiers.\n*[[Phone connector (audio)#Miniature size|3.5&nbsp;mm]] (sometimes referred to as 1/8&nbsp;inch mini) TRS (tip, ring and sleeve) stereo (also available as TS mono) mini phone plug on prosumer camera, recorder and computer microphones.\n*[[USB]] allows direct connection to PCs. Electronics in these microphones powered over the USB connection performs preamplification and ADC before the digital audio data is transferred via the USB interface.\n\nSome microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or \"lapel\", from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporter's suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a [[radio pack]]. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.\n\n=== Impedance-matching ===\nMicrophones have an electrical characteristic called [[electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s&nbsp;(\u03a9), that depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value relates to the impedance of the coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the load impedance for which its amplifier circuitry is designed. Typically, the ''rated impedance'' is stated.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">International Standard IEC 60268-4</ref> Low impedance is considered under 600&nbsp;\u03a9. Medium impedance is considered between 600&nbsp;\u03a9 and 10&nbsp;k\u03a9. High impedance is above 10&nbsp;k\u03a9. Owing to their built-in [[Electronic amplifier|amplifier]], condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200&nbsp;\u03a9.<ref name=Eargle2002>{{cite book |title=Audio Engineering for Sound Reinforcement |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M. Eargle |author2=Chris Foreman |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |location=Milwaukee |isbn=978-0-634-04355-0 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWzZe6z4xdAC }}</ref>\n\nIf a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200&nbsp;\u03a9 or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a [[transformer]] that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available that can be used in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.\n\nLow-impedance microphones are preferred over high impedance for two reasons: one is that using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance{{citation needed|reason=Unless there is an IEEE specification that states specific audio input and output impedances for all equipment, this is an over-reaching statement that might not always (or frequently) be true.|date=September 2015}}. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more [[mains hum|hum]] (and possibly [[Radio frequency interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.\n\nSome microphones are designed ''not'' to have their impedance matched by the load they are connected to.<ref>[http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428071840/http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance|date=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.<ref>Robertson, A. E.: \"Microphones\" Illiffe Press for BBC, 1951\u20131963</ref>{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Digital microphone interface ===\n[[File:Neumann D-01 IBC 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Neumann D-01 digital microphone and Neumann DMI-8 8-channel USB Digital Microphone Interface]]\nThe [[AES42]] standard, published by the [[Audio Engineering Society]], defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or [[XLR connector#XLD keyed variant|XLD]] male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.\n\n== Measurements and specifications ==\n[[Image:Oktava319vsshuresm58.png|thumb|left|A comparison of the far field on-axis frequency response of the Oktava 319 and the [[SM58|Shure SM58]]]]\n\nBecause of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform [[phase (waves)|phase]] and [[frequency]] responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070210000128/http://www.microphone-data.com/]. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC&nbsp;60268-4.\n\nA [[frequency response]] diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in [[decibel]]s over a range of frequencies (typically 20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0\u00b0 to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: \"30&nbsp;Hz\u201316&nbsp;kHz&nbsp;\u00b13&nbsp;dB\". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3&nbsp;dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how ''smooth'' the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as \"20&nbsp;Hz\u201320&nbsp;kHz\" are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC&nbsp;60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in ''plane progressive wave'' conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. ''Close talking'' microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.\n\nThe self-noise or [[equivalent input]] noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in [[dB(A)]], which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: \"15&nbsp;dBA SPL\" (SPL means [[sound pressure]] level relative to 20&nbsp;[[micropascal]]s). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]], which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11\u201314&nbsp;dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20&nbsp;dBA SPL or 32&nbsp;dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Br\u00fcel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0&nbsp;dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from [[Georg Neumann GmbH|Neumann]] and [[R\u00f8de]] that advertise noise levels between 5\u20137&nbsp;dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the [[A-weighting]] curve while broadband noise may be increased.\n\nThe maximum SPL the microphone can accept is measured for particular values of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD), typically 0.5%. This amount of distortion is generally inaudible,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} so one can safely use the microphone at this SPL without harming the recording. Example: \"142&nbsp;[[dB SPL]] peak (at 0.5%&nbsp;THD)\". The higher the value, the better, although microphones with a very high maximum SPL also have a higher self-noise.\n\nThe clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1%&nbsp;THD figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.\n\nThe dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example \"120&nbsp;dB\", it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.\n\n[[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device.  This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, \"transduction gain\" being perhaps more meaningful, (or just \"output level\") because true sensitivity is generally set by the [[noise floor]], and too much \"sensitivity\" in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1&nbsp;kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1&nbsp;V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so \u221260&nbsp; dB is more sensitive than \u221270&nbsp;dB.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Measurement microphones ==<!--[[Measurement microphone]] redirects here-->\n[[Image:AKG C214 condenser microphone with H85 shock mount.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C214 condenser microphone with [[shock mount]]]]\nSome microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations \"Class 1,\" \"Type 2\" etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to [[sound level meter]]s.<ref>IEC Standard 61672 and ANSI S1.4</ref> A more comprehensive standard<ref>IEC 61094</ref> for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.\n\nMeasurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of [[pressure]]; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. [[Sound intensity]] or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with [[Hot-wire anemometry|hot-wire anemometers]].\n\n===Calibration===\n{{Main|Measurement microphone calibration}}\n\nTo take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in [[volt]]s per [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly [[Calibration|calibrate]] measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All [[measurement microphone calibration|microphone calibration]] is ultimately traceable to [[primary standard]]s at a national measurement institute such as [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] in the UK, [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] in Germany and [[NIST]] in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.\n\nDepending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.\n\n== Arrays ==\n{{Main|Microphone array}}\n\nA microphone array is any number of microphones operating in [[tandem]]. There are many applications:\n\n*Systems for extracting voice input from [[ambient noise level|ambient noise]] (notably [[telephone]]s, [[speech recognition]] systems, [[hearing aid]]s)\n*[[Surround sound]] and related technologies\n*Locating objects by sound: [[acoustic source localization]], ''e.g.'', military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.\n*[[High fidelity]] original recordings\n*3D spatial [[beamforming]] for localized acoustic detection of [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] sounds\n\nTypically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the [[perimeter]] of a space, linked to a [[computer]] that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.\n\n{{Anchor|Microphone windscreens}}\n\n== Windscreens ==\n[[File:Microphone and cover.JPG|thumb|Microphone with its windscreen removed.]]\n{{see also|Pop filter}}\n'''Windscreens''' (or windshields \u2013 the terms are interchangeable) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam \"hats\" shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.\n\nThe shielding material used \u2013 wire gauze, fabric or foam \u2013 is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.\n\nSince all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://www.ips.org.uk/files/03_Blasted_Microphones.pdf\n  |title=Blasted microphones \n}}</ref> With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke,<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://www.filmebase.pt/Wind.html\n  |title=Joerg Wuttke \u2013 Microphones and Wind \n}}</ref> which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.\n\nSince turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |url=http://rycote.com/microphone-windshield-shock-mount/cyclone/\n  |title=Rycote Cyclone \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pop filter.jpg|thumb|Singer and disc [[pop filter]] in front of a large-diaphragm condenser mic]]\nIn the studio and on stage, pop-screens and foam shields can be useful for reasons of hygiene, and protecting microphones from spittle and sweat. They can also be useful coloured idents. On location the basket shield can contain a suspension system to isolate the microphone from shock and handling noise.\n\nStating the efficiency of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10\u2013100&nbsp;Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain \u2013 particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical \u201cwumping\u201d sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies \u2013 200&nbsp;Hz to ~3&nbsp;kHz \u2013 the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, even though it has a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10&nbsp;dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50&nbsp;dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Schulze Brakel windshields 1 IBC 2008.jpg|Various microphone covers\nFile:Ecoacoustics recording in Rural Illinois, USA.jpg|Two recordings being made\u2014a ''blimp'' is being used on the left.

Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''.

Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}.

Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.

The arrival of the railroad in 1854 and, three decades later, local attorney Samuel H. Hawkins' construction of the only privately financed railroad in state history, made Americus the eighth largest city in Georgia into the 20th century. It was known as the \"Metropolis of Southwest Georgia,\" a reflection of its status as a cotton distribution center. In 1890, Georgia's first chartered [[electric street car]] system went into operation in Americus. One of its restored cars is on permanent display at the Lake Blackshear Regional Library, a gift from the Robert T. Crabb family who acquired the street car in the 1940s.\n\nThe town was already graced with an abundance of [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] and [[Victorian architecture]] when local capitalists opened the [[Windsor Hotel (Americus)|Windsor Hotel]] in 1892. A five-story Queen Anne edifice, it was designed by a Swedish architect, [[Gottfried L. Norrman]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917 and soon to be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928.\n\nOn January 1, 1976, the city center was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the ''Americus Historic District.''  The district boundaries were extended in 1979.<ref name=nris/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\nFor the local minority community, Rev. Dr. Major W. Reddick established the Americus Institute (1897\u20131932). [[Booker T. Washington]] was a guest speaker there in May 1908. Rev. Alfred S. Staley was responsible for locating the state Masonic Orphanage in Americus, which served its function from 1898 to 1940. Both men engineered the unification of the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia in 1915, the former as president and the latter as recording secretary. The public school named in honor of A.S. Staley was designated a National School of Excellence in 1990.\n\nTwo other institutions of higher learning were also established in Americus, the Third District Agricultural and Mechanical School in 1906 (now [[Georgia Southwestern State University]]), and the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School in 1948 (now [[South Georgia Technical College]]). South Georgia Technical College is located on the original site of [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field].\n\nIn [[World War I]], an [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service]] training facility, [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] (now [[Jimmy Carter Regional Airport]]), was commissioned northeast of the city limits. [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], the \"Lone Eagle,\" bought his first airplane and made his first solo flight there during a two-week stay in May 1923. Recommissioned for [[World War II]], [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] was used for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot training (1941\u20131942)<ref>Gilbert S. Guinn, ''The Arnold Scheme: British Pilots, The American South and the Allies Daring Plan'', History Press, 2007</ref> as well as US pilot training before ending the war as a German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp. The town was incorporated in 1832, and the name Americus was picked out of a hat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weird, Wacky, and Wild Georgia Trivia|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|author2=Lisa Wojna|year=2008|publisher=Blue Bike Books|isbn=978-1-897278-44-4|page=59}}</ref>\n\n*[[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] served as the field manager for the local baseball team after his banishment from professional baseball. A plaque at Thomas Bell Stadium commemorates his contribution to the local baseball program.\n\n===Americus and the Civil Rights Movement===\n[[Koinonia Farm]], an interracial Christian community, was organized near Americus in 1942. Founder [[Clarence Jordan]] was a mentor to [[Millard Fuller|Millard]] and Linda Fuller, who founded [[Habitat for Humanity International]] at Koinonia in 1976 before moving into Americus the following year. In 2005, they founded [[The Fuller Center for Housing]], also in Americus. [[Koinonia Farm]] is currently located southwest of Americus on Hwy. 49.\n\nThe Civil Rights Era in Americus was a time of great turmoil; violent opposition to Koinonia by racist elements led to the bombing of a store uptown in 1957. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] spent a weekend in the courthouse jail in 1961, after an arrest in Albany. The \"Sumter Movement\" to end [[racial segregation]] was organized and led by Rev. Joseph R. Campbell in 1963. As a direct result, two Georgia laws were subsequently declared unconstitutional by a federal tribunal meeting in Americus. Color barriers were first removed in 1965 when J.W. Jones and Henry L. Williams joined the Americus police force. Lewis M. Lowe was elected as the first black city councilman ten years later. With their election in 1995, Eloise R. Paschal and Eddie Rhea Walker broke the gender barrier on the city's governing body.\n\nIn 1971, the city was featured in a [[Marshall Frady]] article, \"Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town\", in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. The portrayal of the city's school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community's history of troubled race relations. Americus' nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when a young black man named Will Redding was lynched by a white mob. A group of young African Americans were standing on the corner of Cotton Avenue and Lamar street.  One of those men was Will Redding.  Police chief Barrow ordered them to move away from the corner, all complied except Redding.  The chief tried to arrest Redding and a struggle ensued.  Will Redding was then hit with the Chief's gun, afterwards, Redding grabbed the gun and shot the police chief.  Will Redding was then chased down, shot, and put in jail.  An angry mob went into the jail and tore down the door to Redding's cell.  When the door was completely torn down, the mob dragged Will Redding out onto Forsyth street and beat him to death using crow bars and hammers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Alan|title=Remembering Americus Georgia: Essays on Southern Life|date=July 30, 2006|publisher=History Press (SC)|isbn=9781596291317|pages=73\u201374https://books.google.com/books?id=svf_7DV9i6UC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=remembering+americus+georgia+essays&source=bl&ots=8fJVoP2Xbf&sig=Z4YA9QeYHCJoQkww6tZLuGRoLv4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J64cVLmbAoGZyAS8lIHYDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=remembering%20americus%20georgia%20essays&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 3259\n|1880= 3635\n|1890= 6398\n|1900= 7674\n|1910= 8063\n|1920= 9010\n|1930= 8760\n|1940= 9281\n|1950= 11389\n|1960= 13472\n|1970= 16091\n|1980= 16120\n|1990= 16512\n|2000= 17013\n|2010= 17041\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15309\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,013 people, 6,374 households, and 4,149 families residing in the city.

While out on a scouting mission with his men, he noticed that there was a great deal of distance between two cities. He decided that he would come back and purchase land to build on in 1825. As he built on his land, his plantation grew very large in cotton production. Soon, more and more people started moving to the location until in 1832 the town of Americus was founded. Gen John's plantation was a huge part in helping Americus grow and providing income for the town. Gen John would later pass of the flu in 1868 at the age of 62 years. After his death his plantation was divided up into sections and auctioned off to different farmers that had now moved into the area.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | page=216}}</ref> A post office has been in operation at Americus since 1833.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/a.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=4 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref>\n\nFor its first two decades, Americus was a small courthouse town. The arrival of the railroad in 1854 and, three decades later, local attorney Samuel H. Hawkins' construction of the only privately financed railroad in state history, made Americus the eighth largest city in Georgia into the 20th century. It was known as the \"Metropolis of Southwest Georgia,\" a reflection of its status as a cotton distribution center. In 1890, Georgia's first chartered [[electric street car]] system went into operation in Americus. One of its restored cars is on permanent display at the Lake Blackshear Regional Library, a gift from the Robert T. Crabb family who acquired the street car in the 1940s.\n\nThe town was already graced with an abundance of [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] and [[Victorian architecture]] when local capitalists opened the [[Windsor Hotel (Americus)|Windsor Hotel]] in 1892. A five-story Queen Anne edifice, it was designed by a Swedish architect, [[Gottfried L. Norrman]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917 and soon to be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928.\n\nOn January 1, 1976, the city center was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the ''Americus Historic District.''  The district boundaries were extended in 1979.<ref name=nris/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\nFor the local minority community, Rev. Dr. Major W. Reddick established the Americus Institute (1897\u20131932). [[Booker T. Washington]] was a guest speaker there in May 1908. Rev. Alfred S. Staley was responsible for locating the state Masonic Orphanage in Americus, which served its function from 1898 to 1940. Both men engineered the unification of the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia in 1915, the former as president and the latter as recording secretary. The public school named in honor of A.S. Staley was designated a National School of Excellence in 1990.\n\nTwo other institutions of higher learning were also established in Americus, the Third District Agricultural and Mechanical School in 1906 (now [[Georgia Southwestern State University]]), and the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School in 1948 (now [[South Georgia Technical College]]). South Georgia Technical College is located on the original site of [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field].\n\nIn [[World War I]], an [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service]] training facility, [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] (now [[Jimmy Carter Regional Airport]]), was commissioned northeast of the city limits. [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], the \"Lone Eagle,\" bought his first airplane and made his first solo flight there during a two-week stay in May 1923. Recommissioned for [[World War II]], [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] was used for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot training (1941\u20131942)<ref>Gilbert S. Guinn, ''The Arnold Scheme: British Pilots, The American South and the Allies Daring Plan'', History Press, 2007</ref> as well as US pilot training before ending the war as a German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp. The town was incorporated in 1832, and the name Americus was picked out of a hat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weird, Wacky, and Wild Georgia Trivia|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|author2=Lisa Wojna|year=2008|publisher=Blue Bike Books|isbn=978-1-897278-44-4|page=59}}</ref>\n\n*[[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] served as the field manager for the local baseball team after his banishment from professional baseball. A plaque at Thomas Bell Stadium commemorates his contribution to the local baseball program.\n\n===Americus and the Civil Rights Movement===\n[[Koinonia Farm]], an interracial Christian community, was organized near Americus in 1942. Founder [[Clarence Jordan]] was a mentor to [[Millard Fuller|Millard]] and Linda Fuller, who founded [[Habitat for Humanity International]] at Koinonia in 1976 before moving into Americus the following year. In 2005, they founded [[The Fuller Center for Housing]], also in Americus. [[Koinonia Farm]] is currently located southwest of Americus on Hwy. 49.\n\nThe Civil Rights Era in Americus was a time of great turmoil; violent opposition to Koinonia by racist elements led to the bombing of a store uptown in 1957. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] spent a weekend in the courthouse jail in 1961, after an arrest in Albany. The \"Sumter Movement\" to end [[racial segregation]] was organized and led by Rev. Joseph R. Campbell in 1963. As a direct result, two Georgia laws were subsequently declared unconstitutional by a federal tribunal meeting in Americus. Color barriers were first removed in 1965 when J.W. Jones and Henry L. Williams joined the Americus police force. Lewis M. Lowe was elected as the first black city councilman ten years later. With their election in 1995, Eloise R. Paschal and Eddie Rhea Walker broke the gender barrier on the city's governing body.\n\nIn 1971, the city was featured in a [[Marshall Frady]] article, \"Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town\", in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. The portrayal of the city's school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community's history of troubled race relations. Americus' nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when a young black man named Will Redding was lynched by a white mob. A group of young African Americans were standing on the corner of Cotton Avenue and Lamar street.  One of those men was Will Redding.  Police chief Barrow ordered them to move away from the corner, all complied except Redding.  The chief tried to arrest Redding and a struggle ensued.  Will Redding was then hit with the Chief's gun, afterwards, Redding grabbed the gun and shot the police chief.  Will Redding was then chased down, shot, and put in jail.  An angry mob went into the jail and tore down the door to Redding's cell.  When the door was completely torn down, the mob dragged Will Redding out onto Forsyth street and beat him to death using crow bars and hammers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Alan|title=Remembering Americus Georgia: Essays on Southern Life|date=July 30, 2006|publisher=History Press (SC)|isbn=9781596291317|pages=73\u201374https://books.google.com/books?id=svf_7DV9i6UC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=remembering+americus+georgia+essays&source=bl&ots=8fJVoP2Xbf&sig=Z4YA9QeYHCJoQkww6tZLuGRoLv4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J64cVLmbAoGZyAS8lIHYDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=remembering%20americus%20georgia%20essays&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 3259\n|1880= 3635\n|1890= 6398\n|1900= 7674\n|1910= 8063\n|1920= 9010\n|1930= 8760\n|1940= 9281\n|1950= 11389\n|1960= 13472\n|1970= 16091\n|1980= 16120\n|1990= 16512\n|2000= 17013\n|2010= 17041\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15309\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,013 people, 6,374 households, and 4,149 families residing in the city.
