Alcorn had posted a [[suicide note]] to her [[Tumblr]] blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people.\n\n[[Sex assignment|Assigned]] male at birth, she was raised in [[Ohio]] by a family affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]] movement. At age 14, she [[coming out|came out]] as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo [[Sex reassignment therapy|transition treatment]], instead sending her to Christian-based [[conversion therapy]] with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to [[social media]]. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She killed herself by walking into traffic on the [[Interstate 71]] highway.\n\nAlcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. [[LGBT rights]] activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of \"Leelah's Law\", a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S., which received a supportive response from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. Within a year, the city of [[Cincinnati]] criminalized conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were severely criticized for [[misgendering]] Leelah in comments that they made to the media, while LGBT rights activist [[Dan Savage]] blamed them for their child's death, and social media users subjected them to [[online harassment]]. Alcorn's parents defended their refusal to accept their child's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian values.\n\n== Life ==\nAlcorn was one of several children.<ref name=Molloy>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/leelah-alcorn-transgender-teenagers-parents-should-be-prosecuted-says-gay-rights-activist-9952742.html |title=Leelah Alcorn: Transgender teenager's parents should be prosecuted, says gay rights activist |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2015 |first=Antonia |last=Molloy |work=The Independent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326231511/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/leelah-alcorn-transgender-teenagers-parents-should-be-prosecuted-says-gay-rights-activist-9952742.html |archivedate=March 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> She described herself as being raised in a conservative Christian environment;<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/read-17yearold-trans-girls-heartbreaking-suicide-note-20141230 |title=Trans Teen Pens Heartbreaking Suicide Note |author=Blistein, Jon |website=Rolling Stone |date=30 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175845/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/read-17yearold-trans-girls-heartbreaking-suicide-note-20141230 |archivedate=April 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy |accessdate=June 23, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=Slate>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/01/02/leelah_alcorn_suicide_prosecuting_her_parents_won_t_help_other_trans_kids.html |title=Prosecuting Leelah Alcorn's Parents Won't Help Isolated, Bullied Trans Kids |last=Urquhart |first=Vanessa Vitiello |website=Slate |date=January 2, 2015 |archivedate=January 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084108/http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/01/02/leelah_alcorn_suicide_prosecuting_her_parents_won_t_help_other_trans_kids.html |url-status=dead |df=mdy |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> she and her family attended the [[Churches of Christ|Northeast Church of Christ]] in [[Cincinnati]], and she had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in ''[[The Christian Chronicle]]''.<ref name=Law>{{cite web |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/leelah-alcorns-dad-we-love-our-son |title=Leelah Alcorn's dad: 'We love our son' |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015 |website=WCPO Cincinnati |last=Law |first=Jason |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101215955/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/leelah-alcorns-dad-we-love-our-son |archivedate=January 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> As of 2014, the family lived in [[Kings Mills, Ohio]].<ref name=LGBTNation/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness.

Alcorn had posted a [[suicide note]] to her [[Tumblr]] blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people.\n\n[[Sex assignment|Assigned]] male at birth, she was raised in [[Ohio]] by a family affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]] movement. At age 14, she [[coming out|came out]] as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo [[Sex reassignment therapy|transition treatment]], instead sending her to Christian-based [[conversion therapy]] with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to [[social media]]. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She killed herself by walking into traffic on the [[Interstate 71]] highway.\n\nAlcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. [[LGBT rights]] activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of \"Leelah's Law\", a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S., which received a supportive response from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. Within a year, the city of [[Cincinnati]] criminalized conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were severely criticized for [[misgendering]] Leelah in comments that they made to the media, while LGBT rights activist [[Dan Savage]] blamed them for their child's death, and social media users subjected them to [[online harassment]]. Alcorn's parents defended their refusal to accept their child's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian values.\n\n== Life ==\nAlcorn was one of several children.<ref name=Molloy>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/leelah-alcorn-transgender-teenagers-parents-should-be-prosecuted-says-gay-rights-activist-9952742.html |title=Leelah Alcorn: Transgender teenager's parents should be prosecuted, says gay rights activist |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2015 |first=Antonia |last=Molloy |work=The Independent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326231511/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/leelah-alcorn-transgender-teenagers-parents-should-be-prosecuted-says-gay-rights-activist-9952742.html |archivedate=March 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> She described herself as being raised in a conservative Christian environment;<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/read-17yearold-trans-girls-heartbreaking-suicide-note-20141230 |title=Trans Teen Pens Heartbreaking Suicide Note |author=Blistein, Jon |website=Rolling Stone |date=30 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175845/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/read-17yearold-trans-girls-heartbreaking-suicide-note-20141230 |archivedate=April 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy |accessdate=June 23, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=Slate>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/01/02/leelah_alcorn_suicide_prosecuting_her_parents_won_t_help_other_trans_kids.html |title=Prosecuting Leelah Alcorn's Parents Won't Help Isolated, Bullied Trans Kids |last=Urquhart |first=Vanessa Vitiello |website=Slate |date=January 2, 2015 |archivedate=January 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084108/http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/01/02/leelah_alcorn_suicide_prosecuting_her_parents_won_t_help_other_trans_kids.html |url-status=dead |df=mdy |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> she and her family attended the [[Churches of Christ|Northeast Church of Christ]] in [[Cincinnati]], and she had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in ''[[The Christian Chronicle]]''.<ref name=Law>{{cite web |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/leelah-alcorns-dad-we-love-our-son |title=Leelah Alcorn's dad: 'We love our son' |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015 |website=WCPO Cincinnati |last=Law |first=Jason |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101215955/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/leelah-alcorns-dad-we-love-our-son |archivedate=January 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> As of 2014, the family lived in [[Kings Mills, Ohio]].<ref name=LGBTNation/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness.
