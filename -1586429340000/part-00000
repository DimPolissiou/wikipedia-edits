Located north of the [[Gleniffer Braes]], the town borders the city of [[Glasgow]] to the east, and straddles the banks of the [[White Cart Water]], a tributary of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nIt serves as the [[administrative centre]] for the [[Renfrewshire]] [[council areas of Scotland|council area]], and is the largest town in the [[counties of Scotland|historic county]] of the [[Renfrewshire (historic)|same name]]. Paisley is often cited as \"Scotland's largest town\" and is the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|fifth largest settlement in the country]], although it does not have city status.\n\nThe town became prominent in the 12th century, with the establishment of [[Paisley Abbey]], an important religious hub which formerly had control over other local churches.\n\nBy the 19th century, Paisley was a centre of the [[weaving]] industry, giving its name to the [[Paisley shawl]] and the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]]. The town's associations with political [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] were highlighted by its involvement in the [[Radical War]] of 1820, with striking weavers being instrumental in the protests. By 1993, all of Paisley's mills had closed, although they are memorialised in the town's museums and civic history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/scotgaz/towns/townfirst383.html|title=Paisley|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:(Coates Memorial Church, Paisley, Scotland) (LOC) (3449508871).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church]], Paisley, Scotland, ca. 1890-1900.]]\n[[File:PaisleyMap1923.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Paisley in early 1900s]]\nFormerly and variously known as ''Paislay'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47680 |title=Extracts from the records \u2013 1588 &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 }}</ref> ''Passelet'', ''Passeleth'', and ''Passelay''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=135820 |title=Paisley &#124; As described in F.H.

However, some Scottish place-name books suggest \"P\u00e6ssa's wood/clearing\", from the Old English personal name ''P\u00e6ssa'', \"clearing\", and ''le\u0101h'', \"wood\". Pasilege (1182) and Paslie (1214) are recorded previous spellings of the name. The Gaelic translation is ''P\u00e0islig''.\n[[File:Paisley mill.jpg|thumb|The Anchor Mills (1886) \u2013 a remnant of Paisley's Victorian industrial heritage.]]\nPaisley has monastic origins. A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th-/7th-century Irish monk, [[Saint Mirin]] at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with [[Glasgow]] and [[Govan]], a major religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. A priory was established in 1163 from the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[priory]] at [[Wenlock Priory|Wenlock]] in Shropshire, England at the behest of [[Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland]] (d. 1177). In 1245 this was raised to the status of an Abbey. The restored [[Abbey]] and adjacent 'Place' (palace), constructed out of part of the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a [[Church of Scotland]] parish church. One of Scotland's major religious houses, [[Paisley Abbey]] was much favoured by the [[Bruce]] and [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]] royal families. King [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]] (1390\u20131406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that of Princess [[Marjorie Bruce]] (1296\u20131316), ancestor of the Stewarts, is one of [[Scotland]]'s few royal monuments to survive the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nPaisley coalesced under [[James II of Scotland|James II's]] wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the town's status was raised by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Burgh of barony]]. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the Town Council.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Witch Trials===\nThe [[Paisley witches]], also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley in 1697. Seven were convicted and five were hanged and then burnt on the Gallow Green. Their remains were buried at Maxwelton Cross in the west end of the town. This was the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.<ref>Isabel Adam, ''Witch hunt: The Great Scottish Witchcraft Trials of 1697'' (1978)</ref> A horse shoe was placed on top of the site to lock in the evil.

Its location attracted English mill owners; immigrants from [[Ayrshire]] and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children. However, silk fell out of fashion in 1790.<ref>Kimberly Chrisman Campbell, \"Paisley Before the Shawl: The Scottish Silk Gauze Industry,\" ''Textile History'' (2002) 33#2 pp 162-176</ref> The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (cashmere) [[shawl]]s called \"Paisley\". Under the leadership of [[Thomas Coats]] (1809-1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed \"Radical War\" of 1820. Overproduction, the collapse of the shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town.<ref>A. Dickson and W.

The Paisley weavers' most famous products were the shawls, which bore the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]] made fashionable after being worn by a young [[Queen Victoria]]. Despite being of a [[Kashmir]]i design and manufactured in other parts of Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley's name across the western world.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textile industry |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=11 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315024436/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Beyond the Fringe: Shawls of Paisley Design|last=Andrews|first=Meg|website=victoriana.com}}</ref> Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the Paisley pattern remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the local authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textiles |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=5 May 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805151939/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss,<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=2-87660-000-5|location=Paris|pages=7, 9, 43, 48}}</ref> informations on the history of Kashmir Shawls's weaving techniques had been described in books, but in a very unintelligible language. John Irwin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-irwin-1280546.html|title=Obituary: John Irwin|last=Irwin|first=John|date=1997|website=INDEPENDENT|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> published in 1955 a book named Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences, in which he relates the Kashmir Shawls history and how these Shawls spread on the European Market during the XIX\u00b0 century. The book showed images of Shawls woven in India and also 15 images of Shawls woven in United-Kingdom, amongst which one assigned to a Paisley Manufacture, circa 1850. But according to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it resembles by many details a Shawl designed by a French designer named Antony Berrus, born in 1815 at N\u00eemes-France and died in 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=43}}</ref> The designer studied at the drawing School of N\u00eemes, before settling in Paris and opening in the French Capital his own successfull design studio, which employed 200 designers. His textile drawings were sold to Lyon in France, in Scotland, in England, in Austria and also in Kashmir. The fact that Shawls patterns drawings were made in Europe, sold there and also to India, made as a result  the research work extremely difficult, as to give a precise location of manufacture. Therefore in 1973, John Irwin published an update of his book, named as The Kashmir Shawl,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=The Kashmir Shawl|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> in which he removed all the images of the Shawls related to a European manufacturing. Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly states that her research led her to focus on the Shawls Creative Industries in France in the XIX\u00b0 century, for the reason that the Shawl industries in the United-Kingdoms (Paisley), Austria (Vienna), Germany(Elberfeld) widely got their inspiration from France (Paris) and never the opposite. The Author was then inviting textile specialists from these countries to conduct research on their own field. However, Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly specifies the large influence that Kashmir had on the French Shawl creative industries. So the French history of Kashmir Shawls is narrowly linked to the Indian one.\n\n===Political Radicalism===\nThrough its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical town and between 1816 and 1820 became the scene of a [[Radical War]]. Political intrigue, early trades unionism and reforming zeal came together to produce mass demonstrations, cavalry charges down the high street, public riots and trials for treason. Documentation from the period indicates that overthrow of the government was even contemplated by some.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowand|first=David|title=Pictorial History of Paisley|year=1993|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=978-1-84033-435-7|pages=4\u201317|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=549}}</ref> The weavers of Paisley were certainly active in the 'Radical War'. A mixture of religious opinions and healthy drink-fueled debate raged at night amongst the weavers, poets, merchants, masons and others. The perceived radical nature of the inhabitants prompted the Tory Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to comment \"Keep your eye on Paisley\". The poet [[Robert Tannahill]] lived in this setting, working as a weaver. Paisley's annual Sma' Shot Day celebrations held on the first Saturday of July <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paisleyonline.co.uk/html/sma_shot.html |title=Paisley Online |publisher=paisleyonline.co.uk |date=7 July 2012 }}</ref> were initiated in 1856 to commemorate a 19th-century dispute between weavers and employers over payment for \"sma' shot\" \u2013 a small cotton thread which, although unseen, was necessary in holding together garments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Sma' Shot Day |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817090809/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Paisley Barracks]] in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html|title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical|first=Francis H. |last=Groome |publisher= Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, Edinburgh |year= 1882}}</ref>\n\n===Economic Hardship===\nThe economic crisis of 1841&ndash;43 hit Paisley hard as most of the mills shut down. Among the mill owners, 67 of 112 went bankrupt. A quarter of the population was on poor relief. The Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Peel]] decided to act. He secured additional funds for relief and sent his own representative to the city to supervise its distribution. He convinced Queen Victoria to wear Paisley products in order to popularise the products and stimulate demand.<ref>Tony Dickson and Tony Clarke, \"Social Concern and Social Control in Nineteenth Century Scotland: Paisley 1841-1843,\"  ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1986) 65#1 pp 48-60.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861&ndash;1865 [[King Cotton|cut off cotton supplies]] to the [[textile mill]]s of Paisley. The mills in 1861 had a stock of cotton in reserve, but by 1862 there was large-scale shortages and shutdowns. There were no alternative jobs for the workers, and local authorities refused to provide relief. Voluntary relief efforts were inadequate, and the unemployed workers refused to go to workhouses. Workers blamed not the United States, but rather the officials in London for their hardship and did not support the idea of war with the United States.<ref>Lorraine Peters, \"Paisley and the Cotton Famine of 1862\u20141863,\" ''Scottish Economic and Social History'' (2001) 21#2 pp 121-39</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Paisley War Memorial.JPG|thumb|Paisley War Memorial]]\nPaisley suffered heavy losses in the [[First World War]]. The town's war memorial was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] (other sources say [[Harold Tarbolton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100213|title=Basic Biographical Details - Harold Ogle Tarbolton}}</ref>) in 1922 and depicts [[Robert the Bruce]] going into battle on horseback escorted by footsoldiers dressed as [[First World War]] infantry soldiers. It was sculpted by [[Alice Meredith Williams]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n===Paisley Snail===\nPaisley was also the site of an incident that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman allegedly found a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. However, after [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] wound through the courts, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other \"neighbours\" or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do foreseeable harm to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern [[tort]] law. The case is often called the \"Paisley snail.\"\n\n===Second World War===\nOwing to its industrial roots, Paisley, like many industrial towns in [[Renfrewshire]], became a target for German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombers during [[World War II]]. Although it was not bombed as heavily as nearby [[Glasgow]] (see [[Clydebank Blitz]]), air raids still occurred periodically during the early years of the war, killing nearly a hundred people in several separate incidents; on 6 May 1941, a parachute mine was dropped in the early hours of the morning claiming 92 victims; this is billed the worst disaster in Paisley's history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tale of Buddies who perished in World War II|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2011/01/19/tale-of-buddies-who-perished-in-world-war-ii-87085-28007301/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=19 January 2011}}</ref> The [[Gleniffer Braes]], on the southern outskirts of Paisley, are home to a number of \"decoy ponds\" (mock airfields) used by the RAF after the [[Battle of Britain]] as part of a project code-named \"Starfish Decoy\" designed to confuse German spies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paisley's contribution to the Second World War|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/2011/10/17/paisley-s-contribution-to-the-second-world-war-87085-29596687/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Industrial Decline===\nPaisley, as with other areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its [[weaving]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. As a consequence, the [[Paisley pattern]] has long symbolic associations with the town. Until the [[Jacquard loom]] was introduced in the 1820s, weaving was a [[cottage industry]]. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing [[yarn|thread]]. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |title=Coats Viyella |publisher=Archiveshub.ac.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719062445/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in [[India]] and [[Brazil]] by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town in the form of the many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe town also supported a number of engineering works some of which relied on the textile industry, others on [[shipbuilding]]. Paisley once had five shipyards including John Fullerton and Company (1866\u20131928), [[Bow, McLachlan and Company]] (1872\u20131932) and [[Fleming and Ferguson]] (1877\u20131969).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Brown & Polson's.JPG|thumb|left|Advertisement for Brown & Polson's, 1894]]\n[[File:Ferguslie Thread Works, Paisley, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Ferguslie Thread Works in the 1867 Paris World Fair catalogue]]\n\nA number of food manufacture companies existed in Paisley. The preserve manufacturer [[James Robertson (grocer)|Robertsons]] began in Paisley as a grocer whose wife started making [[marmalade]] from oranges in 1860.<ref>{{harv|McCarthy|1988|p=98}}</ref> This product was successful and a factory was opened in Storie Street, Paisley, to produce it in 1866 and additional factories were later opened in Manchester, London and Bristol.<ref name=\"Moisley 1962 297\">{{harv|Moisley|Thain|1962|p=297}}</ref> The company was taken over by [[Rank Hovis McDougall]] who closed its Stevenson Street factory and transferred production to England in the 1970s. Brown and Polson was formed in Paisley in 1840 and two years later started producing [[starch]] for the weaving trades, by 1860 it was making food products including its patent [[cornstarch|cornflour]].<ref name=\"Moisley 1962 297\"/><ref>{{harv|McCarthy|1969|p=99}}</ref> It later became CPC Foods Ltd,<ref>{{harv|Clark|1969|p=203}}</ref> a subsidiary of [[Unilever]], which produced [[Hellmann's and Best Foods|Hellmann's]] [[mayonnaise]], [[Gerber Products Company|Gerber]] baby foods and [[Knorr (brand)|Knorr]] soups. The company ceased production in Paisley in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn 1981 [[Peugeot|Peugeot Talbot]], formerly [[Chrysler]] and before that [[Rootes Group|Rootes]], announced that its [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] factory just outside Paisley would cease production.

There are some hills and ridges which have been absorbed as the town has expanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html |title=Historical perspective for Paisley |publisher=Scottish-places.info }}</ref> The settlement is historically centred on Oakshaw, an area surrounding a hill to the north of the current High Street. Oakshaw is a [[conservation area]], and on the high ground many of Paisley's significant buildings can be found, such as the [[High Kirk]], the [[Coats Observatory, Paisley|Coats Observatory]] and the former John Neilson Institution, which was once a school and is now converted into residential flats.\n\nAround the centre there are a large number of older residential buildings. The town centre, Whitehaugh, Seedhill and Charleston areas contain many examples of [[tenement|Scottish tenement flats]]. Three to four storeys tall, with shops on the ground floor and constructed of local pale and red [[sandstone]], these tenement flats have been extensively restored and modernised over the last two decades{{when|date=June 2017}}.\n\nPaisley expanded steadily, particularly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s, creating many suburbs. [[Castlehead, Paisley|Castlehead]] is a wooded [[conservation area]] primarily made up of Victorian villas where many of the town's leading industrialists made their homes in the late 19th century. [[Thornly Park]] is another conservation area, to the south of the town, just off Neilston Road heading towards [[Barrhead]]. It contains a variety of architecture ranging from [[mock Tudor]] to [[Art Deco]]. Many of the houses were designed by W. D. McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. McLennan also designed several local churches such as St Matthew's and St Nazarene, which is located on Gordon Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nParticularly following the Housing Act 1946, modern Paisley grew into the surrounding countryside, and several large residential areas were created in the post-war period. These include portions of [[Glenburn, Paisley|Glenburn]] (south), [[Foxbar]] (south west), [[Ferguslie Park]] (north west), [[Gallowhill]] (North East) and Hunterhill (South East). [[Gockston]] in the far north of the town has many terraced houses, and after regeneration has many detached and semi-detached houses as well as several blocks of flats. [[Dykebar, Paisley|Dykebar]], to the south east of the town centre, is a residential area which is also the site of [[Dykebar Hospital]], a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn the outskirts of the town are a number of settlements such as [[Ralston, Renfrewshire|Ralston]], a residential area in the far east bordering the city of [[Glasgow]]. Ralston was outside the Paisley burgh boundary when constructed in the 1930s, but as a result of local authority reorganisation in the 1990s, it is now a suburb of Paisley.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Paisley,{{efn|Weather station is located {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=out}} from the Glasgow city centre.}} elevation: {{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1959\u2013present\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 13.5\n|Feb record high C = 14.4\n|Mar record high C = 17.2\n|Apr record high C = 24.4\n|May record high C = 26.5\n|Jun record high C = 29.6\n|Jul record high C = 30.0\n|Aug record high C = 31.0\n|Sep record high C = 26.7\n|Oct record high C = 22.8\n|Nov record high C = 17.7\n|Dec record high C = 14.1\n|Jan high C = 6.9\n|Feb high C = 7.4\n|Mar high C = 9.6\n|Apr high C = 12.6\n|May high C = 15.9\n|Jun high C = 18.1\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 19.2\n|Sep high C = 16.4\n|Oct high C = 12.7\n|Nov high C = 9.4\n|Dec high C = 6.9\n|year high C = 12.9\n|Jan mean C = 4.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.3\n|Apr mean C = 8.7\n|May mean C = 11.6\n|Jun mean C = 14.1\n|Jul mean C = 15.9\n|Aug mean C = 15.5\n|Sep mean C = 13.1\n|Oct mean C = 9.7\n|Nov mean C = 6.7\n|Dec mean C = 4.3\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 1.8\n|Feb low C = 1.8\n|Mar low C = 3.0\n|Apr low C = 4.8\n|May low C = 7.3\n|Jun low C = 10.1\n|Jul low C = 12.0\n|Aug low C = 11.7\n|Sep low C = 9.7\n|Oct low C = 6.7\n|Nov low C = 4.0\n|Dec low C = 1.7\n|year low C = 6.2\n|Jan record low C = \u221214.8\n|Feb record low C = \u22127.5\n|Mar record low C = \u22128.3\n|Apr record low C = \u22124.4\n|May record low C = \u22121.1\n|Jun record low C = 1.5\n|Jul record low C = 3.9\n|Aug record low C = 2.2\n|Sep record low C = -0.2\n|Oct record low C = \u22123.5\n|Nov record low C = \u22126.8\n|Dec record low C = \u221214.5\n|rain colour  = green\n|Jan rain mm = 148.2\n|Feb rain mm = 104.6\n|Mar rain mm = 112.3\n|Apr rain mm = 63.6\n|May rain mm = 67.5\n|Jun rain mm = 66.4\n|Jul rain mm = 73.0\n|Aug rain mm = 92.5\n|Sep rain mm = 112.5\n|Oct rain mm = 143.1\n|Nov rain mm = 126.4\n|Dec rain mm = 135.2\n|year rain mm = \n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 17.3\n|Feb rain days = 13.2\n|Mar rain days = 14.9\n|Apr rain days = 11.6\n|May rain days = 11.9\n|Jun rain days = 11.1\n|Jul rain days = 12.0\n|Aug rain days = 12.8\n|Sep rain days = 13.8\n|Oct rain days = 16.8\n|Nov rain days = 16.0\n|Dec rain days = 15.5\n|year rain days =167.0\n|Jan sun = 37.6\n|Feb sun = 66.9\n|Mar sun = 98.6\n|Apr sun = 134.5\n|May sun = 180.1\n|Jun sun = 158.9\n|Jul sun = 154.3\n|Aug sun = 146.8\n|Sep sun = 114.9\n|Oct sun = 85.2\n|Nov sun = 54.0\n|Dec sun = 33.1\n|year sun = 1265.0\n|source 1 = Met Office <ref name = PaisleyStats >\n{{cite web\n  | url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/paisley.html\n  | title= Paisley 1981\u20132010 averages\n  | publisher= [[Met Office]]\n  | work = Station, District and regional averages 1981-2010\n  | accessdate=2012-11-04\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = KNMI/Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute<ref name = AnomalyMaps >\n{{cite web\n  | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/mapserver/anomaly.php?indexcat=**&indexid=TNn&year=1995&seasonid=7&minx=-1142380.952381&miny=-4965714.2857143&maxx=590952.38095239&maxy=-3665714.2857143&MapSize=560%2C420&imagewidth=560&imageheight=420&CMD=QUERY_POINT&CMD=QUERY_POINT#bottom\n  | title= KNMI: Climate Extremes 1959-\n  | publisher= [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute|KNMI]]\n  | accessdate=31 October 2011\n}}</ref>\n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Economy==\nPublic sector organisations in Paisley include the headquarters of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the largest campus of the [[University of the West of Scotland]], the Paisley campus of [[West College Scotland]] and the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley|Royal Alexandra Hospital]].\n\n[[Glasgow Airport]], located on the northern edge of Paisley, is also a significant employer and part of the area's transport infrastructure.

Paisley Town Hall, adjacent to the Abbey, was funded by the will of [[George Aitken Clark]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clark, George Aitken|volume=10}}</ref> one of the Clark family, owners of the Anchor Mills. In competition, Sir Peter Coats funded the construction of the modern [[Paisley Museum and Art Gallery|Paisley Museum]] and Central Library (1871), also in a neo-Classical style. The Clarks and Coats families dominated Paisley industry until their companies merged in 1896.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\"/> Renfrewshire's former County Buildings, Police Station and Jail on County Square have been since demolished, and the County Council then met in a newer neo-classical building which now houses Paisley Sheriff Court.\n\nRenfrewshire House, the modern headquarters of Renfrewshire Council, was constructed as Paisley Civic Centre. Designed by Hutchison, Locke and Monk following a competition, the building was designed to house offices of both the county and town councils.

The earliest surviving architecture is the south-east doorway in the nave from the cloister, which has a round arched doorway typical of Romanesque or Norman architecture which was the prevalent architectural style before the adoption of Gothic. The choir (east end) and tower date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. They were reconstructed in three main phases of restorations with the tower and choir conforming to the designs of Dr Peter MacGregor Chalmers. The roof in the nave is the most recent of restorations with the plaster ceiling by Rev Dr Boog which was added in the 1790s being replaced by a timber roof in 1981.\n[[File:PaisleyCoatsChurch.jpg|thumb|Thomas Coats Memorial Church]]\n[[File:High Church - geograph.org.uk - 387075.jpg|thumb|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]]\n[[Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church]], named for the industrialist [[Thomas Coats]] (1809\u20131883), is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]].

The church also contains a 3040 pipe Hill Organ.\n\nThe [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] in Incle Street is the seat of the Catholic [[Bishop of Paisley]]. The church was completed in 1931 to replace an earlier building, in nearby East Buchanan Street, which dated from 1808. The original St Mirin's church was the first Catholic church to be built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. With the erection of the [[Diocese of Paisley]] in 1947 the church was raised to cathedral status.\n\n[[St Matthew's Church, Paisley|St Matthew's Church]] ([[Church of the Nazarene]]) at the junction of Gordon Street and Johnston Street is [[Art Nouveau]] in style.

Paisley is often cited as \"Scotland's largest town\" and is the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|fifth largest settlement in the country]], although it does not have city status.\n\nThe town became prominent in the 12th century, with the establishment of [[Paisley Abbey]], an important religious hub which formerly had control over other local churches.\n\nBy the 19th century, Paisley was a centre of the [[weaving]] industry, giving its name to the [[Paisley shawl]] and the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]]. The town's associations with political [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] were highlighted by its involvement in the [[Radical War]] of 1820, with striking weavers being instrumental in the protests.

The Gaelic translation is ''P\u00e0islig''.\n[[File:Paisley mill.jpg|thumb|The Anchor Mills (1886) \u2013 a remnant of Paisley's Victorian industrial heritage.]]\nPaisley has monastic origins. A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th-/7th-century Irish monk, [[Saint Mirin]] at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with [[Glasgow]] and [[Govan]], a major religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. A priory was established in 1163 from the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[priory]] at [[Wenlock Priory|Wenlock]] in Shropshire, England at the behest of [[Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland]] (d. 1177). In 1245 this was raised to the status of an Abbey. The restored [[Abbey]] and adjacent 'Place' (palace), constructed out of part of the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a [[Church of Scotland]] parish church. One of Scotland's major religious houses, [[Paisley Abbey]] was much favoured by the [[Bruce]] and [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]] royal families. King [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]] (1390\u20131406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that of Princess [[Marjorie Bruce]] (1296\u20131316), ancestor of the Stewarts, is one of [[Scotland]]'s few royal monuments to survive the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nPaisley coalesced under [[James II of Scotland|James II's]] wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the town's status was raised by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Burgh of barony]]. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the Town Council.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Witch Trials===\nThe [[Paisley witches]], also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley in 1697. Seven were convicted and five were hanged and then burnt on the Gallow Green. Their remains were buried at Maxwelton Cross in the west end of the town. This was the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.<ref>Isabel Adam, ''Witch hunt: The Great Scottish Witchcraft Trials of 1697'' (1978)</ref> A horse shoe was placed on top of the site to lock in the evil.

Its location attracted English mill owners; immigrants from [[Ayrshire]] and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children. However, silk fell out of fashion in 1790.<ref>Kimberly Chrisman Campbell, \"Paisley Before the Shawl: The Scottish Silk Gauze Industry,\" ''Textile History'' (2002) 33#2 pp 162-176</ref> The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (cashmere) [[shawl]]s called \"Paisley\". Under the leadership of [[Thomas Coats]] (1809-1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed \"Radical War\" of 1820. Overproduction, the collapse of the shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town.<ref>A. Dickson and W. Speirs, \"Changes in Class Structure in Paisley, 1750-1845,\" ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1980) 59#1 pp 54-72.</ref>\n\n=== Origins of Paisley Shawls ===\nBy the mid-19th century weaving had become the town's principal industry. The Paisley weavers' most famous products were the shawls, which bore the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]] made fashionable after being worn by a young [[Queen Victoria]]. Despite being of a [[Kashmir]]i design and manufactured in other parts of Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley's name across the western world.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textile industry |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=11 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315024436/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Beyond the Fringe: Shawls of Paisley Design|last=Andrews|first=Meg|website=victoriana.com}}</ref> Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the Paisley pattern remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the local authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textiles |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=5 May 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805151939/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss,<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=2-87660-000-5|location=Paris|pages=7, 9, 43, 48}}</ref> informations on the history of Kashmir Shawls's weaving techniques had been described in books, but in a very unintelligible language. John Irwin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-irwin-1280546.html|title=Obituary: John Irwin|last=Irwin|first=John|date=1997|website=INDEPENDENT|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> published in 1955 a book named Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences, in which he relates the Kashmir Shawls history and how these Shawls spread on the European Market during the XIX\u00b0 century. The book showed images of Shawls woven in India and also 15 images of Shawls woven in United-Kingdom, amongst which one assigned to a Paisley Manufacture, circa 1850. But according to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it resembles by many details a Shawl designed by a French designer named Antony Berrus, born in 1815 at N\u00eemes-France and died in 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=43}}</ref> The designer studied at the drawing School of N\u00eemes, before settling in Paris and opening in the French Capital his own successfull design studio, which employed 200 designers. His textile drawings were sold to Lyon in France, in Scotland, in England, in Austria and also in Kashmir. The fact that Shawls patterns drawings were made in Europe, sold there and also to India, made as a result  the research work extremely difficult, as to give a precise location of manufacture. Therefore in 1973, John Irwin published an update of his book, named as The Kashmir Shawl,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=The Kashmir Shawl|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> in which he removed all the images of the Shawls related to a European manufacturing. Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly states that her research led her to focus on the Shawls Creative Industries in France in the XIX\u00b0 century, for the reason that the Shawl industries in the United-Kingdoms (Paisley), Austria (Vienna), Germany(Elberfeld) widely got their inspiration from France (Paris) and never the opposite. The Author was then inviting textile specialists from these countries to conduct research on their own field. However, Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly specifies the large influence that Kashmir had on the French Shawl creative industries. So the French history of Kashmir Shawls is narrowly linked to the Indian one.\n\n===Political Radicalism===\nThrough its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical town and between 1816 and 1820 became the scene of a [[Radical War]]. Political intrigue, early trades unionism and reforming zeal came together to produce mass demonstrations, cavalry charges down the high street, public riots and trials for treason. Documentation from the period indicates that overthrow of the government was even contemplated by some.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowand|first=David|title=Pictorial History of Paisley|year=1993|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=978-1-84033-435-7|pages=4\u201317|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=549}}</ref> The weavers of Paisley were certainly active in the 'Radical War'. A mixture of religious opinions and healthy drink-fueled debate raged at night amongst the weavers, poets, merchants, masons and others. The perceived radical nature of the inhabitants prompted the Tory Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to comment \"Keep your eye on Paisley\". The poet [[Robert Tannahill]] lived in this setting, working as a weaver.

Among the mill owners, 67 of 112 went bankrupt. A quarter of the population was on poor relief. The Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Peel]] decided to act. He secured additional funds for relief and sent his own representative to the city to supervise its distribution. He convinced Queen Victoria to wear Paisley products in order to popularise the products and stimulate demand.<ref>Tony Dickson and Tony Clarke, \"Social Concern and Social Control in Nineteenth Century Scotland: Paisley 1841-1843,\"  ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1986) 65#1 pp 48-60.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861&ndash;1865 [[King Cotton|cut off cotton supplies]] to the [[textile mill]]s of Paisley. The mills in 1861 had a stock of cotton in reserve, but by 1862 there was large-scale shortages and shutdowns. There were no alternative jobs for the workers, and local authorities refused to provide relief. Voluntary relief efforts were inadequate, and the unemployed workers refused to go to workhouses. Workers blamed not the United States, but rather the officials in London for their hardship and did not support the idea of war with the United States.<ref>Lorraine Peters, \"Paisley and the Cotton Famine of 1862\u20141863,\" ''Scottish Economic and Social History'' (2001) 21#2 pp 121-39</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Paisley War Memorial.JPG|thumb|Paisley War Memorial]]\nPaisley suffered heavy losses in the [[First World War]]. The town's war memorial was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] (other sources say [[Harold Tarbolton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100213|title=Basic Biographical Details - Harold Ogle Tarbolton}}</ref>) in 1922 and depicts [[Robert the Bruce]] going into battle on horseback escorted by footsoldiers dressed as [[First World War]] infantry soldiers. It was sculpted by [[Alice Meredith Williams]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n===Paisley Snail===\nPaisley was also the site of an incident that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman allegedly found a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. However, after [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] wound through the courts, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other \"neighbours\" or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do foreseeable harm to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern [[tort]] law. The case is often called the \"Paisley snail.\"\n\n===Second World War===\nOwing to its industrial roots, Paisley, like many industrial towns in [[Renfrewshire]], became a target for German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombers during [[World War II]]. Although it was not bombed as heavily as nearby [[Glasgow]] (see [[Clydebank Blitz]]), air raids still occurred periodically during the early years of the war, killing nearly a hundred people in several separate incidents; on 6 May 1941, a parachute mine was dropped in the early hours of the morning claiming 92 victims; this is billed the worst disaster in Paisley's history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tale of Buddies who perished in World War II|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2011/01/19/tale-of-buddies-who-perished-in-world-war-ii-87085-28007301/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=19 January 2011}}</ref> The [[Gleniffer Braes]], on the southern outskirts of Paisley, are home to a number of \"decoy ponds\" (mock airfields) used by the RAF after the [[Battle of Britain]] as part of a project code-named \"Starfish Decoy\" designed to confuse German spies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paisley's contribution to the Second World War|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/2011/10/17/paisley-s-contribution-to-the-second-world-war-87085-29596687/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Industrial Decline===\nPaisley, as with other areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its [[weaving]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. As a consequence, the [[Paisley pattern]] has long symbolic associations with the town. Until the [[Jacquard loom]] was introduced in the 1820s, weaving was a [[cottage industry]]. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing [[yarn|thread]]. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |title=Coats Viyella |publisher=Archiveshub.ac.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719062445/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in [[India]] and [[Brazil]] by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town in the form of the many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe town also supported a number of engineering works some of which relied on the textile industry, others on [[shipbuilding]]. Paisley once had five shipyards including John Fullerton and Company (1866\u20131928), [[Bow, McLachlan and Company]] (1872\u20131932) and [[Fleming and Ferguson]] (1877\u20131969).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Brown & Polson's.JPG|thumb|left|Advertisement for Brown & Polson's, 1894]]\n[[File:Ferguslie Thread Works, Paisley, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Ferguslie Thread Works in the 1867 Paris World Fair catalogue]]\n\nA number of food manufacture companies existed in Paisley.

There are some hills and ridges which have been absorbed as the town has expanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html |title=Historical perspective for Paisley |publisher=Scottish-places.info }}</ref> The settlement is historically centred on Oakshaw, an area surrounding a hill to the north of the current High Street. Oakshaw is a [[conservation area]], and on the high ground many of Paisley's significant buildings can be found, such as the [[High Kirk]], the [[Coats Observatory, Paisley|Coats Observatory]] and the former John Neilson Institution, which was once a school and is now converted into residential flats.\n\nAround the centre there are a large number of older residential buildings. The town centre, Whitehaugh, Seedhill and Charleston areas contain many examples of [[tenement|Scottish tenement flats]]. Three to four storeys tall, with shops on the ground floor and constructed of local pale and red [[sandstone]], these tenement flats have been extensively restored and modernised over the last two decades{{when|date=June 2017}}.\n\nPaisley expanded steadily, particularly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s, creating many suburbs. [[Castlehead, Paisley|Castlehead]] is a wooded [[conservation area]] primarily made up of Victorian villas where many of the town's leading industrialists made their homes in the late 19th century. [[Thornly Park]] is another conservation area, to the south of the town, just off Neilston Road heading towards [[Barrhead]]. It contains a variety of architecture ranging from [[mock Tudor]] to [[Art Deco]]. Many of the houses were designed by W. D. McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. McLennan also designed several local churches such as St Matthew's and St Nazarene, which is located on Gordon Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nParticularly following the Housing Act 1946, modern Paisley grew into the surrounding countryside, and several large residential areas were created in the post-war period. These include portions of [[Glenburn, Paisley|Glenburn]] (south), [[Foxbar]] (south west), [[Ferguslie Park]] (north west), [[Gallowhill]] (North East) and Hunterhill (South East). [[Gockston]] in the far north of the town has many terraced houses, and after regeneration has many detached and semi-detached houses as well as several blocks of flats. [[Dykebar, Paisley|Dykebar]], to the south east of the town centre, is a residential area which is also the site of [[Dykebar Hospital]], a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn the outskirts of the town are a number of settlements such as [[Ralston, Renfrewshire|Ralston]], a residential area in the far east bordering the city of [[Glasgow]]. Ralston was outside the Paisley burgh boundary when constructed in the 1930s, but as a result of local authority reorganisation in the 1990s, it is now a suburb of Paisley.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Paisley,{{efn|Weather station is located {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=out}} from the Glasgow city centre.}} elevation: {{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1959\u2013present\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 13.5\n|Feb record high C = 14.4\n|Mar record high C = 17.2\n|Apr record high C = 24.4\n|May record high C = 26.5\n|Jun record high C = 29.6\n|Jul record high C = 30.0\n|Aug record high C = 31.0\n|Sep record high C = 26.7\n|Oct record high C = 22.8\n|Nov record high C = 17.7\n|Dec record high C = 14.1\n|Jan high C = 6.9\n|Feb high C = 7.4\n|Mar high C = 9.6\n|Apr high C = 12.6\n|May high C = 15.9\n|Jun high C = 18.1\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 19.2\n|Sep high C = 16.4\n|Oct high C = 12.7\n|Nov high C = 9.4\n|Dec high C = 6.9\n|year high C = 12.9\n|Jan mean C = 4.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.3\n|Apr mean C = 8.7\n|May mean C = 11.6\n|Jun mean C = 14.1\n|Jul mean C = 15.9\n|Aug mean C = 15.5\n|Sep mean C = 13.1\n|Oct mean C = 9.7\n|Nov mean C = 6.7\n|Dec mean C = 4.3\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 1.8\n|Feb low C = 1.8\n|Mar low C = 3.0\n|Apr low C = 4.8\n|May low C = 7.3\n|Jun low C = 10.1\n|Jul low C = 12.0\n|Aug low C = 11.7\n|Sep low C = 9.7\n|Oct low C = 6.7\n|Nov low C = 4.0\n|Dec low C = 1.7\n|year low C = 6.2\n|Jan record low C = \u221214.8\n|Feb record low C = \u22127.5\n|Mar record low C = \u22128.3\n|Apr record low C = \u22124.4\n|May record low C = \u22121.1\n|Jun record low C = 1.5\n|Jul record low C = 3.9\n|Aug record low C = 2.2\n|Sep record low C = -0.2\n|Oct record low C = \u22123.5\n|Nov record low C = \u22126.8\n|Dec record low C = \u221214.5\n|rain colour  = green\n|Jan rain mm = 148.2\n|Feb rain mm = 104.6\n|Mar rain mm = 112.3\n|Apr rain mm = 63.6\n|May rain mm = 67.5\n|Jun rain mm = 66.4\n|Jul rain mm = 73.0\n|Aug rain mm = 92.5\n|Sep rain mm = 112.5\n|Oct rain mm = 143.1\n|Nov rain mm = 126.4\n|Dec rain mm = 135.2\n|year rain mm = \n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 17.3\n|Feb rain days = 13.2\n|Mar rain days = 14.9\n|Apr rain days = 11.6\n|May rain days = 11.9\n|Jun rain days = 11.1\n|Jul rain days = 12.0\n|Aug rain days = 12.8\n|Sep rain days = 13.8\n|Oct rain days = 16.8\n|Nov rain days = 16.0\n|Dec rain days = 15.5\n|year rain days =167.0\n|Jan sun = 37.6\n|Feb sun = 66.9\n|Mar sun = 98.6\n|Apr sun = 134.5\n|May sun = 180.1\n|Jun sun = 158.9\n|Jul sun = 154.3\n|Aug sun = 146.8\n|Sep sun = 114.9\n|Oct sun = 85.2\n|Nov sun = 54.0\n|Dec sun = 33.1\n|year sun = 1265.0\n|source 1 = Met Office <ref name = PaisleyStats >\n{{cite web\n  | url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/paisley.html\n  | title= Paisley 1981\u20132010 averages\n  | publisher= [[Met Office]]\n  | work = Station, District and regional averages 1981-2010\n  | accessdate=2012-11-04\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = KNMI/Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute<ref name = AnomalyMaps >\n{{cite web\n  | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/mapserver/anomaly.php?indexcat=**&indexid=TNn&year=1995&seasonid=7&minx=-1142380.952381&miny=-4965714.2857143&maxx=590952.38095239&maxy=-3665714.2857143&MapSize=560%2C420&imagewidth=560&imageheight=420&CMD=QUERY_POINT&CMD=QUERY_POINT#bottom\n  | title= KNMI: Climate Extremes 1959-\n  | publisher= [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute|KNMI]]\n  | accessdate=31 October 2011\n}}</ref>\n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Economy==\nPublic sector organisations in Paisley include the headquarters of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the largest campus of the [[University of the West of Scotland]], the Paisley campus of [[West College Scotland]] and the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley|Royal Alexandra Hospital]].\n\n[[Glasgow Airport]], located on the northern edge of Paisley, is also a significant employer and part of the area's transport infrastructure.

Designed by Hutchison, Locke and Monk following a competition, the building was designed to house offices of both the county and town councils.

The earliest surviving architecture is the south-east doorway in the nave from the cloister, which has a round arched doorway typical of Romanesque or Norman architecture which was the prevalent architectural style before the adoption of Gothic. The choir (east end) and tower date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. They were reconstructed in three main phases of restorations with the tower and choir conforming to the designs of Dr Peter MacGregor Chalmers.

The church was completed in 1931 to replace an earlier building, in nearby East Buchanan Street, which dated from 1808. The original St Mirin's church was the first Catholic church to be built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. With the erection of the [[Diocese of Paisley]] in 1947 the church was raised to cathedral status.\n\n[[St Matthew's Church, Paisley|St Matthew's Church]] ([[Church of the Nazarene]]) at the junction of Gordon Street and Johnston Street is [[Art Nouveau]] in style. Designed by local architect William Daniel McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], it was built in 1905\u201307.\n\n===Other===\nDating from circa 1160 [[Blackhall Manor]] is the oldest building in Paisley.

A district is usually named after the main town or its administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]]; for example, the town of [[Sandakan]] is the capital of the Sandakan District, as well as the capital of [[Sandakan Division]].

An administrative district is administered by lands and district office which is headed by district officer.\n\nIn [[Peninsular Malaysia]], a district is a subdivision of a [[States of Malaysia|state]]. A ''[[mukim]]'' is a subdivision of a district. The mukim is however of less importance with respect to the administration of land.\n\nIn [[East Malaysia]], a district is a subdivision of a [[Divisions of Malaysia|division]] of a state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ymy.html |title=Malaysia Districts |publisher=Statoids.com |date= |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> For example, [[Tuaran District|Tuaran]] is a district within the [[West Coast Division]] of [[Sabah]]. A district is usually named after the main town or its administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]]; for example, the town of [[Sandakan]] is the capital of the Sandakan District, as well as the capital of [[Sandakan Division]]. In [[Sarawak]], some districts are further divided into sub-districts (''daerah kecil''; literally \"small district\") before the mukim level, while [[Sabah]] are not divided into mukim.\n\nAn administrative district can be distinguished from a [[Local government in Malaysia|local government]] area where the former deals with land administration and revenue while the latter deals with the planning and delivery of basic infrastructure to its inhabitants. Administrative district boundaries are usually coextensive with local government area boundaries but may sometimes differ especially in urbanised areas. For example, the local government of [[Petaling District]] in [[Selangor]] are administrated by [[Petaling Jaya City Council]], [[Shah Alam City Council]] and [[Subang Jaya Municipal Council]]; or even the local government of both [[Northeast Penang Island District]] and [[Southwest Penang Island District]] in [[Penang]] are administrated by [[City Council of Penang Island|Penang Island City Council]].
