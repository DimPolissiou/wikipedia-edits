The country possesses no laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination, expect in the judicial system.\n\nThe Human Truth Foundation has listed the Marshall Islands at rank 88 for LGBT rights.

The report documents how government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion have changed and increased, from 2007 to 2017. It said 52 governments impose high levels of restrictions on religion, up from 40 in 2007, while 56 countries experienced the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion, up from 38 in 2007. According to the report, laws and policies restricting religious freedom and government favoritism of religious groups are the two types of restrictions that have been the most prevalent. The trends suggest that religious restrictions have been rising around the world but not so evenly across all geographic regions or all kinds of restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2019/jul/20/religion-restrictions-increase/|title=Religion restrictions increase|date=2019-07-20|website=The Columbian|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewforum.org/2019/07/15/a-closer-look-at-how-religious-restrictions-have-risen-around-the-world/|title=How Religious Restrictions Have Risen Around the World{{!}} Pew Research Center|last=NW|first=1615 L.
