And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

announced on March 14, 2013 by Herring Networks, Inc., a family-owned national video programming company, which also owns sister channel [[AWE (TV network)|AWE]]. The OAN channel originally debuted in partnership with ''[[The Washington Times]]''.<ref name=\"WT02\"/>  On television, the network predominantly uses the acronym \"OAN\", whereas on Twitter it is more frequently known as \"OANN\". The network's web [[URL]] domain is at \"OANN.com\" but the  site banner reads \"OAN\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oann.com/|title=One America News Network {{!}} Your Nation.

OAN President Charles Herring told the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] that \"[[Fox News]] has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences... But those who consider themselves liberal have a half-dozen or more choices on TV each day...\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Freedlander|first=David|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/14/one-america-news-network-new-conservative-cable-channel-sets-launch.html|title=One America News Network, New Conservative Cable Channel, Sets Launch|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 14, 2013|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Herring also emphasized the network's separation of news from opinion content.

announced on March 14, 2013 by Herring Networks, Inc., a family-owned national video programming company, which also owns sister channel [[AWE (TV network)|AWE]]. The OAN channel originally debuted in partnership with ''[[The Washington Times]]''.<ref name=\"WT02\"/>  On television, the network predominantly uses the acronym \"OAN\", whereas on Twitter it is more frequently known as \"OANN\". The network's web [[URL]] domain is at \"OANN.com\" but the  site banner reads \"OAN\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oann.com/|title=One America News Network {{!}} Your Nation.

OAN President Charles Herring told the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] that \"[[Fox News]] has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences... But those who consider themselves liberal have a half-dozen or more choices on TV each day...\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Freedlander|first=David|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/14/one-america-news-network-new-conservative-cable-channel-sets-launch.html|title=One America News Network, New Conservative Cable Channel, Sets Launch|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 14, 2013|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Herring also emphasized the network's separation of news from opinion content.

The facility consisted of 54 LPG storage tanks; 6 large spherical tanks (four holding {{convert|1,600|m3}} and two holding {{convert|2,400|m3}}) and 48 smaller horizontal bullet shaped tanks of various sizes. All together the tanks contained {{convert|11,000|m3}} of a [[propane]]/[[butane]] mixture at the time of the accident.\n\n==Origin==\nThe disaster was initiated by a [[gas leak]] on the site, likely caused by a pipe [[wikt:rupture|rupture]] during transfer operations, which caused a plume of LPG to concentrate at ground level for 10 minutes. The plume eventually grew large enough to drift on the wind towards the west end of the site, where the facility's waste-gas flare pit was located.\n\n==The fire==\nAt 5:40&nbsp;a.m., the cloud reached the flare and ignited, resulting in a [[vapor cloud explosion]] that severely damaged the tank farm and resulted in a massive [[conflagration]] fed by the LPG [[leak]]ing from newly damaged tanks. Just four minutes later, at 5:44&nbsp;a.m., the first tank underwent a [[BLEVE]] (Boiling Liquid/Expanding Vapor Explosion). Over the next hour, 12 separate BLEVE explosions were recorded. The fire and smaller explosions continued until 10 a.m. the next morning. It is believed that the escalation was caused by an ineffective gas detection system.\n\n==Damage and casualties==\nThe town of San Juan Ixhuatepec surrounded the facility and consisted of 40,000 residents, with an additional 61,000 more living in the hills. The explosions demolished houses and propelled twisted metal fragments (some measuring 30 tons) over distances ranging from a few meters to up to {{convert|1200|m}}. The explosion shock wave destroyed a range of 5&nbsp;km-7Km of houses and businesses at various level. Windows were found destroyed at 10&nbsp;km due to the blast wave. Much of the town was destroyed by the explosions and ensuing fire, with the current statistics indicating 500 to 600 deaths, and 5,000&ndash;7,000 severe injuries. Radiant heat generated by the inferno incinerated most corpses to ashes, with only 2% of the recovered remains left in recognizable condition.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.unizar.es/guiar/1/Accident/San_Juan.htm Universidad de Zaragoza - Reporte de Accidente de San Juan Ixhuatepec]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406024957/http://www.proteccioncivil-andalucia.org/Documentos/SanJuanico.htm Protecci\u00f3n Civil Anda Lucia - Datos sobre la explosi\u00f3n de San Juanico]\n*{{cite journal | pmid = 3580941 | doi=10.1016/0305-4179(87)90096-9 | volume=13 | title=The tragedy of San Juanico--the most severe LPG disaster in history | date=April 1987 | journal=Burns Incl Therm Inj | pages=87\u2013102 | last1 = Arturson | first1 = G}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNcgEeCVIEo Explosiones en San Juanico] - YouTube video on the disaster showing casualty response, burning LPG spherical tanks, among other things\n*[http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sragtech/casepemex84.htm PEMEX LPG Terminal, Mexico City, Mexico. 19 November 1984] - [[Health and Safety Executive]]\n\n{{coord|19|31|08|N|99|06|20|W|region:MX-MEX_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Industrial fires and explosions in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Gas explosions]]\n[[Category:1984 in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Tlalnepantla de Baz]]\n[[Category:Explosions in 1984]]\n[[Category:November 1984 events in Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n[[File:Gaskessel gr.jpg|thumb|250px|In the San Juanico Disaster, six of these spherical type [[liquid petroleum gas]] (LPG) containers exploded into huge fireballs killing 500&ndash;600 people and causing severe burns in 5000&ndash;7000 others.]]\n\nThe '''San Juanico disaster''' was an [[industry|industrial]] [[disaster]] caused by a massive series of explosions at a [[liquid petroleum gas]] (LPG) tank farm in San Juanico, Mexico (outside of [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]) on 19 November 1984.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Arturson\n| first1       = G.\n|date=April 1987\n| title        = The tragedy of San Juanico--the most severe LPG disaster in history\n| journal      = Burns Incl Therm Inj. \n| volume       = 13\n| issue        = 2\n| pages        = 87\u2013102\n| pmid         = 3580941\n| doi = 10.1016/0305-4179(87)90096-9\n}}\n</ref> The [[Gas explosion|explosions]] consumed 11,000 m<sup>3</sup> of LPG, representing one third of Mexico City's entire liquid petroleum gas supply.
