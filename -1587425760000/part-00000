He earned his fortune in [[Canada]] and moved to the [[Bahamas]] in the 1930s for tax purposes. He became a [[British citizen]] and was granted the hereditary title of [[baronet]] in 1939.\n\nOakes was murdered in 1943 under mysterious circumstances, and the subsequent trial ended with acquittal of the accused. No further legal proceedings have taken place on the matter, the cause of death and the details surrounding it have never been entirely determined, and the case has been the subject of several books and four films.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Harry and Eunice Oakes in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Harry and Eunice Oakes in [[Toronto]] in the 1930s]]\nOakes was born in [[Sangerville, Maine]], one of five children of William Pitt Oakes and Edith Nancy Lewis. His father was a prosperous lawyer. Harry Oakes graduated from [[Foxcroft Academy]] and went on to [[Bowdoin College]] in 1896,<ref>''Time'' magazine, July 18, 1943.</ref> and he spent two years at the [[Syracuse University]] Medical School.<ref name=\"houts1976\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, 1976</ref> One of his sisters, Gertrude Oakes, died in the 1935 sinking of the ocean liner [[SS Mohawk (1925)|SS ''Mohawk'']] off the New Jersey coast.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Mining career===\nIn 1898, Oakes left medical school before graduation and made his way to [[Alaska]], at the height of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], in hopes of making his fortune as a [[Prospecting|prospector]]. For 15 years, he sought gold around the world, from [[California]] to [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Houts, 1976\">Houts, 1976</ref>\n\nOakes arrived in [[Kirkland Lake]] in [[Northern Ontario]], Canada, on 19 June 1911.<ref name=Pain>{{cite book|last=Pain|first=S.A.|title=Three Miles of Gold: The Story of Kirkland Lake|year=1960|publisher=The Ryerson Press|location=Toronto|pages=17}}</ref> On September 23, 1911, he registered the transfer of claim T-1663, purchased from George Minaker, and established [[Lake Shore Mine]].<ref name=Pain/><ref name=\"houts1976\"/> Twenty years later, the gold mine was the most productive in the Western Hemisphere, and it ultimately proved to be the second-largest gold mine in the Americas.

He was invited to the British colony by Sir Harold Christie, a prominent Bahamian real estate developer and legislator, who became a close business associate and friend.\n\nIn 1939, Oakes was created a [[baronet]] by [[King George VI]] as a reward for his philanthropic endeavours in the Bahamas, Canada and Britain. He donated US$500,000 in two bequests to [[St George's Hospital]] in [[London]], and he gave US$1 million to charities in the Bahamas.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, 1976, pp. 12-13.</ref> He became a member of the colony's [[House of Assembly (Bahamas)|House of Assembly]].<ref name=\"houts1976\"/>\n\n===Bahamian investments===\nOakes soon proved to be a dynamic investor, entrepreneur and developer in the Bahamas. He had a major role in expanding the airport, Oakes Field, in the capital [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]; bought the [[British Colonial Hilton Nassau]]; built a golf course and country club; and developed farming and new housing. All of this activity greatly stimulated the struggling economy, with only about 70,000 inhabitants in the early 1940s. This activity took place mainly on the principal island of [[New Providence]]; it was estimated that Oakes owned about one-third of that island by the early 1940s.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/> Oakes had become the colony's wealthiest, most powerful, and most important resident by the early 1940s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1988\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 30 June 1923, Oakes married Eunice Myrtle McIntyre in [[Sydney, Australia]].

He was struck four times behind the left ear with a miner's hand pick and was then burned all over his body using insecticide, with the flames being concentrated around the eyes. His body was then sprinkled with feathers from a mattress. When Oakes was discovered, the feathers were still being gently blown over his body by the bedroom fan.<ref>''Flame of Power: Intimate Profiles of Canada's Greatest Businessmen'', by Peter C. Newman, 1959, pp. 127.</ref>\n\n===Investigation and trial===\nThe Bahamas\u2019 [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|Governor]], the [[Duke of Windsor]] (formerly [[King Edward VIII]] of the United Kingdom), who had become a close friend of Oakes during the previous three years, took charge of the investigation from the outset. The Duke first attempted to enforce press [[censorship]], but this was unsuccessful, since the Bahamas Tribune newspaper broke the story to the world within a few hours.<ref>''The Woman He Loved'' by Ralph G. Martin, 1974, Simon and Schuster, New York</ref> Oakes' vast wealth, fame and British title, combined with the ghastly nature of the crime, generated worldwide interest in the case. [[Etienne Dupuch]], the colony's foremost newspaper publisher and a close friend of Oakes, ensured constant coverage of the case for the several months which followed.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/> Dupuch had called the Oakes residence early on the morning after the crime, since he had previously arranged to visit, and spoke with Harold Christie, who had stayed there overnight; Christie reported the death to Dupuch.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\">Martin, 1974</ref>\n\nThe Duke believed that the local police lacked the expertise to investigate the crime, and since [[World War II]] was raging, making it difficult to bring detectives from [[Scotland Yard]] in London, which was what normally would have been done, the Duke turned to two American policemen he knew in the [[Miami]] force. The Bahamas was a British Crown Colony at the time, and there were British Security personnel stationed in wartime in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] who could potentially have traveled easily and quickly to Nassau for an investigation. Bringing in the Miami Captains Melchen and Barker (Melchen had earlier guarded the Duke in Miami) proved an unfortunate decision.<ref name=\"houts2\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976; ''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)]], St. Martin's Press, 1988</ref>\n\nThe two American detectives were, in theory, called upon to assist Bahamian law enforcement, but to the dismay of the local police, they completely took over the investigation. The two American policemen had forgotten their fingerprint kits in Miami, and in any case, the local Bahamas police force did have fingerprint kits available right in Nassau.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\"/> By evening on the second day of the investigation, 36 hours after Oakes' body was discovered, they had arrested Oakes' son-in-law, [[Count]] [[Alfred de Marigny]]. De Marigny had [[elope]]d with and married Oakes' daughter Nancy in New York City (where she was studying), without her parents' knowledge, two days after her 18th birthday, in 1942. Once she had reached age 18, Nancy no longer needed her parents' permission to wed. De Marigny, 14 years older, had met Nancy at the Nassau Yacht Club, where he was a prominent competitive sailor. The two had been dating for a couple of years before their marriage, without her parents apparently fully realizing the seriousness of their relationship. De Marigny was thought to have been on bad terms with Oakes, due to de Marigny's [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] manners and lack of a meaningful career, the fact that he had been married twice before for short periods to wealthy women, and that he had not asked Oakes' permission to marry Nancy. Oakes and de Marigny had quarreled on several occasions, witnessed by other people.<ref name=\"houts2\"/>\n\nWhen Nancy was informed of her father's death and her husband's arrest, she was in Miami on her way for the summer to study dance with [[Martha Graham]] at [[Bennington, Vermont]]. It was her great friend [[Merce Cunningham]] who gave her the bad news. She then traveled to [[Bar Harbor, Maine]], the family's summer home, to join her mother, at her husband's request. But Nancy soon returned to Nassau and began to organize her husband's defence. She was convinced that de Marigny was innocent and stood by him when many others, including her family, believed him guilty. The young countess soon became a favourite with the press worldwide for her auburn hair, deep-set eyes, fine figure and mild resemblance to [[Katharine Hepburn]]. The murder managed to knock the war off the front pages temporarily. Nancy spent heavily to hire a leading American private investigator, [[Raymond Schindler]], to dig deeply into the case, and a prominent British-trained Bahamian lawyer, Godfrey W. Higgs, to defend her husband. They eventually found serious flaws in the prosecution's case.<ref name=\"KingofFools\">''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)]], St. Martin's Press, 1988; ''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes'', by Marshall Houts, 1976.</ref>\n\nDe Marigny was committed for trial, and a rope was ordered for his hanging. However, he was [[acquit]]ted in a trial that lasted several weeks, after the detectives were suspected of fabricating [[evidence]] against him. The chief piece of evidence was a [[fingerprint]] of his, which Captain Barker claimed had been found on a Chinese screen in Oakes' bedroom where the body had been found. Later, it was discovered that the print had been lifted from the water glass that de Marigny had used during his questioning by the Miami Police captains, and that de Marigny was being framed.<ref name=\"Houts, 1976\"/>\n\nImmediately after Oakes' funeral had been held in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]] (the family's summer home), Captain Barker, visiting by invitation, told Nancy and Lady Oakes that he had already positively identified de Marigny's fingerprints on the Chinese screen, justifying de Marigny's status as the main suspect. Very detailed and thorough cross-examination at the trial, several months later, by de Marigny's lawyer showed that Barker had not in fact positively identified the single fingerprint as belonging to de Marigny until several days later than he had originally claimed - after he had returned to Miami - and that Barker had taken several dozen other fingerprints from Oakes' bedroom, many of which were still unprocessed weeks later. An American fingerprint expert witness, testifying for the defence, called into question the professionalism of the techniques used by Captain Barker in the investigation. The expert testified that the de Marigny print very likely could not have come from the Chinese screen, since none of the background pattern design from the screen appeared on the de Marigny print photograph, although other photos of fingerprints lifted from the screen showed this pattern. De Marigny testified that he had not visited Westbourne, Oakes' home and the murder site, for two years before Oakes' death, because of ongoing conflict with Oakes. Several of de Marigny's dinner party guests from the fateful night testified at the trial, and strengthened de Marigny's alibi that he was hosting the party, and later drove several guests to their homes, late at night, with a witness in the car, near the time when the murder was committed. The approximate time of the murder had been determined by two Bahamian medical examiners.<ref name=\"Marshall Houts 1976\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref> Significantly, the Duke of Windsor arranged to be away from the Bahamas while the murder trial was in progress so he was not available to be called as a witness.<ref name=\"Marshall Houts 1976\"/>\n\nOakes' murderer has never been found, and there were no court proceedings in the case after de Marigny's acquittal.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\"/> The case received worldwide press coverage at the time, with photos of the beautiful and charming Nancy in court. It has been the subject of continuous interest, including several books and films (see below). The first full-length book on the case -- ''The Murder of Sir Harry Oakes'', was published by the Bahamas Tribune newspaper in 1959; the paper was edited at the time by [[Etienne Dupuch]].<ref>''The Woman He Loved'', by Ralph G. Martin, 1974, Simon and Schuster, New York</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nAfter the trial Nancy went with de Marigny to [[Cuba]] to stay with their old friend [[Ernest Hemingway]]. De Marigny was deported to Cuba after a recommendation by the murder trial's jury, because of his supposedly unsavoury character and frequent advances towards young girls in the Bahamas. De Marigny and Nancy separated in 1945, and divorced in 1949. He moved to Canada in 1945 and served for a time in the [[Canadian Army]], but was later deported from Canada. He married his fourth wife, settled in [[Central America]], and died in 1998. De Marigny was a tall,<ref name=\"houts3\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976</ref> handsome man, a charming and bright conversationalist and an accomplished competitive sailor who won many regattas,<ref>''King of Fools'', by John Parker (author), 1988</ref> and he later wrote two books.\n\nNancy had left Cuba by the late 1940s, and lived in [[Hollywood, California]], where she had a long affair with 1950s Hollywood actor [[Richard Greene]]. She had a daughter, Patricia Oakes. She remained close friends with Greene until his death. In 1952 she married Baron Ernst Lyssardt von Hoyningen-Huene (adopted cousin of the artist [[George Hoyningen-Huene]], the only son of Baron Barthold Theodor Hermann (Theodorovitch) von Hoyningen-Huene, a German nobleman who had estates in [[Estonia]] that were confiscated by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s during [[World War II]] and was the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ambassador to Portugal during World War II,<ref>''Bodyguard of Lies'', by [[Anthony Cave Brown]], 1975</ref>). They had a son, Baron Alexander von Hoyningen-Huene. The marriage lasted until 1956. Nancy died in 2005 and was survived by her two children and two grandchildren.\n\n==Oakes' legacy==\n[[File:Museum of Northern History.JPG|thumb|Oakes' former home in Kirkland Lake]]Oakes' [[Sir Harry Oakes Chateau|former home]] in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, is now the [[Museum of Northern History]], dedicated to his life and to the region's mining history. Kirkland Lake is where he made his fortune as a prospector. He was inducted into the [[Canadian Mining Hall of Fame]].\n\nThe [[Oakes Baronets|Oakes baronetcy]] of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], was assumed by Oakes's son Sir Sydney Oakes (1927\u20131966). On his death, Sir Sydney's son Christopher (born 1949) inherited the title. A district in Nassau was named after Oakes, complete with a memorial.

Bocca, then working as a bartender in New York City, had met private detective Raymond Schindler, one of his customers, who had investigated the Oakes case for Nancy. Bocca used Schindler's notes, researched the case very thoroughly, and his book was a best-seller.\n|- \n| 3\n| 1972 (1st ed)<br>1976 (2nd ed) \n| ''Kings X''<br><br>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?''\n| [[Marshall Houts]]\n| The 1st edition (1972 book ''Kings X'') and the second edition (1976 as ''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'') was published in London by Robert Hale publishers. Houts was an American lawyer, and an [[FBI]] agent. In the first and second editions of his book, Houts proposed the theory that American [[gangster]] boss [[Meyer Lansky]] was behind the killing of Oakes, due to Oakes' resistance to casino gambling in the Bahamas. Lansky had apparently already obtained the approval of the [[Duke of Windsor|Duke]] for his plans to develop gambling on the islands, after meeting with the Duke in Miami. Lansky was working with Christie, a property developer and Bahamian legislator, and other notable Bahamians, including [[Stafford Sands]] (who was the jury foreman at the de Marigny murder trial),<ref name=\"houts3\"/> to bring this about, with significant new construction of hotels to house tourists as part of the plan. Houts wrote that Oakes had earlier apparently given his approval for the casino project, but then changed his mind by the time of his murder, strongly opposing it. Houts wrote that Lansky sent several henchmen to meet Oakes on the night of the murder. The henchmen were to intimidate, try to persuade, and rough up Oakes if necessary, but not kill him, during a late-night meeting with Christie held aboard a fast powerboat that had traveled from Miami to Nassau earlier that day. But Oakes, age 68, died, and this was covered up. Oakes' body was taken back to his home by Christie (who was spotted as a passenger in his own station wagon by a Nassau Police Captain late that night, a fact which came out at the trial of de Marigny, and which directly contradicted Christie's statement that he had not left Oakes' home overnight), and a fake killing was then staged at Oakes' home, 'Westbourne'. Oakes had earlier, in 1940, allowed the Duke and [[Duchess of Windsor]] to stay at Westbourne while their official residence, Government House, was being renovated, and the Duke had slept in the bed where Oakes' body was found.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'' by Marshall Houts, 1976.</ref>  It had troubled Bahamian legal authorities in the lead-up to the de Marigny trial that Oakes' body had apparently been moved, ascertained by examination of blood data, which showed blood flowing uphill, according to the case presented by prosecutors.<ref>''King of Fools'' by [[John Parker (author)]], American edition, 1988, St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|0-312-02598-X}}, pp. 275-278; ''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'' by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref> Houts also wrote that Lansky later privately punished his henchmen who had been involved with the murder, but did not specify the punishment.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/>\n|- \n| 4\n| 1983 (reissued in 2001 and 2011)\n| ''[http://www.jamesleasor.com/who-killed-sir-harry-oakes/#=true Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?]''\n| [[James Leasor]]\n| Leasor's book connects the Oakes murder with the 1942 sinking of the ''[[SS Normandie|Normandie]]'' ocean liner in New York harbour and the Allied landings in Sicily.

Lansky, together with other major organized crime figures, already had extensive casino interests in neighbouring Cuba. Early in his career, Parker had worked as a journalist in the Bahamas for several years, and dug into the Oakes case quite deeply. The two Miami police detectives were suspected of being on Lansky's payroll, and the Duke was warned off instigating a more professional investigation. Parker goes so far as to draw potential business connections between Lansky and the Duke, who had earlier met in Cuba. Parker wrote that the Duke had tried unsuccessfully to impose press censorship of the case from the start. The Duke directed the murder investigation from the beginning, but he and the [[Duchess of Windsor]] contrived to be visiting the United States during the de Marigny trial, so the Duke was not called as a witness.<ref>''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)|John Parker]], American edition, St Martin's Press, 1988.</ref> The Duke kept silent about the murder for the rest of his life.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref>\n|- \n| 7\n| 1989\n| ''Passion and Paradise''\n| [[Harvey Hart]]\n| [[Television]] movie made about the case starring [[Armand Assante]] as de Marigny and [[Rod Steiger]] (with an inaccurate Maine accent) as Oakes.\n|- \n| 8\n| 1988 (1st ed)<br>2005 (2nd ed)\n| ''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life''\n| [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]]\n| Higham wrote about the case in the first (1988) and second (2005) editions of his biography of the Duchess of Windsor. He devoted a chapter, entitled 'Crime of the Century' in the first edition, and 'Death in Nassau' in the second edition, to the case. He carried out a thorough investigation with the assistance of modern experts in criminology. He also dug deeply into archival sources, including previously-classified files of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation. His conclusion in both the first and second editions is that Oakes was murdered by an African ritual specialist from South Florida, who had been hired and brought into Nassau by airplane on the day before the murder, by Harold Christie, a Bahamian [[mulatto]] business associate of Oakes. Christie and Oakes, the much wealthier man, had been friends and business partners for many years, and Christie had facilitated Oakes' move to the Bahamas. The two had apparently fallen out shortly before Oakes' death, because of Christie's dealings over the sale of Bahamian property on the island of [[New Providence]], which was scheduled to be used for a new airfield by the [[Royal Air Force]], a project of which the Duke of Windsor would certainly have been aware and involved with, since it had important strategic and economic implications, and would involve large expenses. Christie, a member of the colony's House of Assembly, had been a dinner guest at Oakes' home on the evening the murder occurred, and had stayed overnight in Oakes' home on many previous occasions. Christie said that he had slept in a bedroom the night of the murder, only a few metres away from that of Oakes on the night of the murder, and claimed he had neither heard nor seen anything suspicious. Christie had to take the witness stand for an extended period during the de Marigny trial, and his testimony was not convincing to the jury. Christie was later [[knight]]ed for his contributions to the Bahamas, and died a wealthy man in 1973. He had apparently told close friends several years afterwards that he was directly involved in Oakes' murder.<ref>''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life'', second edition, by [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], 2005; chapter 'Death in Nassau', pp. 381-404.</ref>\n|- \n| 9\n| 1990\n| ''A Conspiracy of Crowns''\n| [[Alfred de Marigny]] and [[Mickey Herskowitz]]\n| [[Alfred de Marigny]]\u2014the accused killer in the Oakes trial\u2014wrote his own account, along with Mickey Herskowitz, published in 1990.\n|-\n| 10\n| 1994\n| \"[[Carnal Hours]]: A Nathan Heller Mystery\"\n| [[Max Allan Collins]]\n| Another fictionalized account concerning the death of Sir Harry, with speculations concerning the killer(s).

This book was written by experienced forensics author Colin Evans, who has written several prior similar books. Evans writes concisely and thoroughly in this volume. He examines in detail 15 of the most important and controversial forensics cases throughout history, including a chapter on the Oakes case: 'Alfred de Marigny', pp.&nbsp;90\u2013103. Evans focuses on the Oakes murder and its bungled forensics aspects, including a planted fingerprint, which, when brought to the murder trial of de Marigny, with precise and strong cross-examination by the accused's lawyer, proved decisive in securing de Marigny's acquittal.\n|- \n| 13\n| 2005\n| ''Blood and Fire: the Duke of Windsor and the Strange Murder of Sir Harry Oakes''\n| John Marquis\n| Marquis' book was described by American reviewer Art Paine as 'the best written of all the Oakes books to date' and by Sir [[Christopher Ondaatje]] in Canada's ''National Post'' as the most 'explicitly accusatory' of all the Oakes books. Marquis dismisses the Lansky theories, and claims the murder was strictly a local affair, with white Bahamian businessmen\u2014including Sir Harold Christie\u2014getting rid of Oakes to prevent movement of his vast fortune to Mexico, a move that would have undermined the Bahamian economy. Marquis, who was editor of Nassau's leading daily newspaper for ten years, also believes the Duke conspired to frame de Marigny by hiring two crooked Miami detectives to conduct the murder investigation. This, he maintains, was also to prevent inquiries by the FBI and Scotland Yard, who he feared would expose his own involvement in illegal money transfers to Mexico during wartime currency restrictions. Marquis makes two very significant revelations in support of his theories: one concerns a passport found amongst rubble in a Nassau street, the other a comment from the Bahamas police chief who was transferred to Trinidad and Tobago at the height of the Oakes inquiries (also used by other authors). He also cites the involvement of the Oakes' family lawyer, Walter Foskett, who he claims was robbing Oakes and was in dispute with him at the time of the killing.

He donated US$500,000 in two bequests to [[St George's Hospital]] in [[London]], and he gave US$1 million to charities in the Bahamas.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, 1976, pp. 12-13.</ref> He became a member of the colony's [[House of Assembly (Bahamas)|House of Assembly]].<ref name=\"houts1976\"/>\n\n===Bahamian investments===\nOakes soon proved to be a dynamic investor, entrepreneur and developer in the Bahamas. He had a major role in expanding the airport, Oakes Field, in the capital [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]; bought the [[British Colonial Hilton Nassau]]; built a golf course and country club; and developed farming and new housing. All of this activity greatly stimulated the struggling economy, with only about 70,000 inhabitants in the early 1940s. This activity took place mainly on the principal island of [[New Providence]]; it was estimated that Oakes owned about one-third of that island by the early 1940s.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/> Oakes had become the colony's wealthiest, most powerful, and most important resident by the early 1940s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1988\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 30 June 1923, Oakes married Eunice Myrtle McIntyre in [[Sydney, Australia]].

He was struck four times behind the left ear with a miner's hand pick and was then burned all over his body using insecticide, with the flames being concentrated around the eyes. His body was then sprinkled with feathers from a mattress. When Oakes was discovered, the feathers were still being gently blown over his body by the bedroom fan.<ref>''Flame of Power: Intimate Profiles of Canada's Greatest Businessmen'', by Peter C. Newman, 1959, pp. 127.</ref>\n\n===Investigation and trial===\nThe Bahamas\u2019 [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|Governor]], the [[Duke of Windsor]] (formerly [[King Edward VIII]] of the United Kingdom), who had become a close friend of Oakes during the previous three years, took charge of the investigation from the outset. The Duke first attempted to enforce press [[censorship]], but this was unsuccessful, since the Bahamas Tribune newspaper broke the story to the world within a few hours.<ref>''The Woman He Loved'' by Ralph G. Martin, 1974, Simon and Schuster, New York</ref> Oakes' vast wealth, fame and British title, combined with the ghastly nature of the crime, generated worldwide interest in the case. [[Etienne Dupuch]], the colony's foremost newspaper publisher and a close friend of Oakes, ensured constant coverage of the case for the several months which followed.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/> Dupuch had called the Oakes residence early on the morning after the crime, since he had previously arranged to visit, and spoke with Harold Christie, who had stayed there overnight; Christie reported the death to Dupuch.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\">Martin, 1974</ref>\n\nThe Duke believed that the local police lacked the expertise to investigate the crime, and since [[World War II]] was raging, making it difficult to bring detectives from [[Scotland Yard]] in London, which was what normally would have been done, the Duke turned to two American policemen he knew in the [[Miami]] force. The Bahamas was a British Crown Colony at the time, and there were British Security personnel stationed in wartime in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] who could potentially have traveled easily and quickly to Nassau for an investigation. Bringing in the Miami Captains Melchen and Barker (Melchen had earlier guarded the Duke in Miami) proved an unfortunate decision.<ref name=\"houts2\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976; ''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)]], St. Martin's Press, 1988</ref>\n\nThe two American detectives were, in theory, called upon to assist Bahamian law enforcement, but to the dismay of the local police, they completely took over the investigation. The two American policemen had forgotten their fingerprint kits in Miami, and in any case, the local Bahamas police force did have fingerprint kits available right in Nassau.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\"/> By evening on the second day of the investigation, 36 hours after Oakes' body was discovered, they had arrested Oakes' son-in-law, [[Count]] [[Alfred de Marigny]]. De Marigny had [[elope]]d with and married Oakes' daughter Nancy in New York City (where she was studying), without her parents' knowledge, two days after her 18th birthday, in 1942. Once she had reached age 18, Nancy no longer needed her parents' permission to wed. De Marigny, 14 years older, had met Nancy at the Nassau Yacht Club, where he was a prominent competitive sailor. The two had been dating for a couple of years before their marriage, without her parents apparently fully realizing the seriousness of their relationship. De Marigny was thought to have been on bad terms with Oakes, due to de Marigny's [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] manners and lack of a meaningful career, the fact that he had been married twice before for short periods to wealthy women, and that he had not asked Oakes' permission to marry Nancy. Oakes and de Marigny had quarreled on several occasions, witnessed by other people.<ref name=\"houts2\"/>\n\nWhen Nancy was informed of her father's death and her husband's arrest, she was in Miami on her way for the summer to study dance with [[Martha Graham]] at [[Bennington, Vermont]]. It was her great friend [[Merce Cunningham]] who gave her the bad news. She then traveled to [[Bar Harbor, Maine]], the family's summer home, to join her mother, at her husband's request. But Nancy soon returned to Nassau and began to organize her husband's defence. She was convinced that de Marigny was innocent and stood by him when many others, including her family, believed him guilty. The young countess soon became a favourite with the press worldwide for her auburn hair, deep-set eyes, fine figure and mild resemblance to [[Katharine Hepburn]]. The murder managed to knock the war off the front pages temporarily. Nancy spent heavily to hire a leading American private investigator, [[Raymond Schindler]], to dig deeply into the case, and a prominent British-trained Bahamian lawyer, Godfrey W. Higgs, to defend her husband. They eventually found serious flaws in the prosecution's case.<ref name=\"KingofFools\">''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)]], St. Martin's Press, 1988; ''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes'', by Marshall Houts, 1976.</ref>\n\nDe Marigny was committed for trial, and a rope was ordered for his hanging. However, he was [[acquit]]ted in a trial that lasted several weeks, after the detectives were suspected of fabricating [[evidence]] against him. The chief piece of evidence was a [[fingerprint]] of his, which Captain Barker claimed had been found on a Chinese screen in Oakes' bedroom where the body had been found. Later, it was discovered that the print had been lifted from the water glass that de Marigny had used during his questioning by the Miami Police captains, and that de Marigny was being framed.<ref name=\"Houts, 1976\"/>\n\nImmediately after Oakes' funeral had been held in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]] (the family's summer home), Captain Barker, visiting by invitation, told Nancy and Lady Oakes that he had already positively identified de Marigny's fingerprints on the Chinese screen, justifying de Marigny's status as the main suspect. Very detailed and thorough cross-examination at the trial, several months later, by de Marigny's lawyer showed that Barker had not in fact positively identified the single fingerprint as belonging to de Marigny until several days later than he had originally claimed - after he had returned to Miami - and that Barker had taken several dozen other fingerprints from Oakes' bedroom, many of which were still unprocessed weeks later. An American fingerprint expert witness, testifying for the defence, called into question the professionalism of the techniques used by Captain Barker in the investigation. The expert testified that the de Marigny print very likely could not have come from the Chinese screen, since none of the background pattern design from the screen appeared on the de Marigny print photograph, although other photos of fingerprints lifted from the screen showed this pattern. De Marigny testified that he had not visited Westbourne, Oakes' home and the murder site, for two years before Oakes' death, because of ongoing conflict with Oakes. Several of de Marigny's dinner party guests from the fateful night testified at the trial, and strengthened de Marigny's alibi that he was hosting the party, and later drove several guests to their homes, late at night, with a witness in the car, near the time when the murder was committed. The approximate time of the murder had been determined by two Bahamian medical examiners.<ref name=\"Marshall Houts 1976\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref> Significantly, the Duke of Windsor arranged to be away from the Bahamas while the murder trial was in progress so he was not available to be called as a witness.<ref name=\"Marshall Houts 1976\"/>\n\nOakes' murderer has never been found, and there were no court proceedings in the case after de Marigny's acquittal.<ref name=\"Martin, 1974\"/> The case received worldwide press coverage at the time, with photos of the beautiful and charming Nancy in court.

Martin, 1974, Simon and Schuster, New York</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nAfter the trial Nancy went with de Marigny to [[Cuba]] to stay with their old friend [[Ernest Hemingway]]. De Marigny was deported to Cuba after a recommendation by the murder trial's jury, because of his supposedly unsavoury character and frequent advances towards young girls in the Bahamas. De Marigny and Nancy separated in 1945, and divorced in 1949. He moved to Canada in 1945 and served for a time in the [[Canadian Army]], but was later deported from Canada. He married his fourth wife, settled in [[Central America]], and died in 1998. De Marigny was a tall,<ref name=\"houts3\">''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976</ref> handsome man, a charming and bright conversationalist and an accomplished competitive sailor who won many regattas,<ref>''King of Fools'', by John Parker (author), 1988</ref> and he later wrote two books.\n\nNancy had left Cuba by the late 1940s, and lived in [[Hollywood, California]], where she had a long affair with 1950s Hollywood actor [[Richard Greene]]. She had a daughter, Patricia Oakes. She remained close friends with Greene until his death. In 1952 she married Baron Ernst Lyssardt von Hoyningen-Huene (adopted cousin of the artist [[George Hoyningen-Huene]], the only son of Baron Barthold Theodor Hermann (Theodorovitch) von Hoyningen-Huene, a German nobleman who had estates in [[Estonia]] that were confiscated by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s during [[World War II]] and was the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ambassador to Portugal during World War II,<ref>''Bodyguard of Lies'', by [[Anthony Cave Brown]], 1975</ref>). They had a son, Baron Alexander von Hoyningen-Huene. The marriage lasted until 1956. Nancy died in 2005 and was survived by her two children and two grandchildren.\n\n==Oakes' legacy==\n[[File:Museum of Northern History.JPG|thumb|Oakes' former home in Kirkland Lake]]Oakes' [[Sir Harry Oakes Chateau|former home]] in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, is now the [[Museum of Northern History]], dedicated to his life and to the region's mining history.

Lady Eunice Oakes gave it to Bowdoin College in 1958 and operated it as the Oakes Center, a conference center, till the early 1970s when it was sold to brothers James and Sonny Cough. They developed the land and built an oceanfront hotel comprised of several buildings called the Atlantic Oakes. Their heirs renovated the mansion back to its formerly glory.

Houts was an American lawyer, and an [[FBI]] agent. In the first and second editions of his book, Houts proposed the theory that American [[gangster]] boss [[Meyer Lansky]] was behind the killing of Oakes, due to Oakes' resistance to casino gambling in the Bahamas. Lansky had apparently already obtained the approval of the [[Duke of Windsor|Duke]] for his plans to develop gambling on the islands, after meeting with the Duke in Miami. Lansky was working with Christie, a property developer and Bahamian legislator, and other notable Bahamians, including [[Stafford Sands]] (who was the jury foreman at the de Marigny murder trial),<ref name=\"houts3\"/> to bring this about, with significant new construction of hotels to house tourists as part of the plan. Houts wrote that Oakes had earlier apparently given his approval for the casino project, but then changed his mind by the time of his murder, strongly opposing it. Houts wrote that Lansky sent several henchmen to meet Oakes on the night of the murder. The henchmen were to intimidate, try to persuade, and rough up Oakes if necessary, but not kill him, during a late-night meeting with Christie held aboard a fast powerboat that had traveled from Miami to Nassau earlier that day. But Oakes, age 68, died, and this was covered up. Oakes' body was taken back to his home by Christie (who was spotted as a passenger in his own station wagon by a Nassau Police Captain late that night, a fact which came out at the trial of de Marigny, and which directly contradicted Christie's statement that he had not left Oakes' home overnight), and a fake killing was then staged at Oakes' home, 'Westbourne'. Oakes had earlier, in 1940, allowed the Duke and [[Duchess of Windsor]] to stay at Westbourne while their official residence, Government House, was being renovated, and the Duke had slept in the bed where Oakes' body was found.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'' by Marshall Houts, 1976.</ref>  It had troubled Bahamian legal authorities in the lead-up to the de Marigny trial that Oakes' body had apparently been moved, ascertained by examination of blood data, which showed blood flowing uphill, according to the case presented by prosecutors.<ref>''King of Fools'' by [[John Parker (author)]], American edition, 1988, St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|0-312-02598-X}}, pp. 275-278; ''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?'' by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref> Houts also wrote that Lansky later privately punished his henchmen who had been involved with the murder, but did not specify the punishment.<ref name=\"houts1976\"/>\n|- \n| 4\n| 1983 (reissued in 2001 and 2011)\n| ''[http://www.jamesleasor.com/who-killed-sir-harry-oakes/#=true Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?]''\n| [[James Leasor]]\n| Leasor's book connects the Oakes murder with the 1942 sinking of the ''[[SS Normandie|Normandie]]'' ocean liner in New York harbour and the Allied landings in Sicily.

Lansky, together with other major organized crime figures, already had extensive casino interests in neighbouring Cuba. Early in his career, Parker had worked as a journalist in the Bahamas for several years, and dug into the Oakes case quite deeply. The two Miami police detectives were suspected of being on Lansky's payroll, and the Duke was warned off instigating a more professional investigation. Parker goes so far as to draw potential business connections between Lansky and the Duke, who had earlier met in Cuba. Parker wrote that the Duke had tried unsuccessfully to impose press censorship of the case from the start. The Duke directed the murder investigation from the beginning, but he and the [[Duchess of Windsor]] contrived to be visiting the United States during the de Marigny trial, so the Duke was not called as a witness.<ref>''King of Fools'', by [[John Parker (author)|John Parker]], American edition, St Martin's Press, 1988.</ref> The Duke kept silent about the murder for the rest of his life.<ref>''Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes'', by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.</ref>\n|- \n| 7\n| 1989\n| ''Passion and Paradise''\n| [[Harvey Hart]]\n| [[Television]] movie made about the case starring [[Armand Assante]] as de Marigny and [[Rod Steiger]] (with an inaccurate Maine accent) as Oakes.\n|- \n| 8\n| 1988 (1st ed)<br>2005 (2nd ed)\n| ''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life''\n| [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]]\n| Higham wrote about the case in the first (1988) and second (2005) editions of his biography of the Duchess of Windsor. He devoted a chapter, entitled 'Crime of the Century' in the first edition, and 'Death in Nassau' in the second edition, to the case. He carried out a thorough investigation with the assistance of modern experts in criminology. He also dug deeply into archival sources, including previously-classified files of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation. His conclusion in both the first and second editions is that Oakes was murdered by an African ritual specialist from South Florida, who had been hired and brought into Nassau by airplane on the day before the murder, by Harold Christie, a Bahamian [[mulatto]] business associate of Oakes. Christie and Oakes, the much wealthier man, had been friends and business partners for many years, and Christie had facilitated Oakes' move to the Bahamas. The two had apparently fallen out shortly before Oakes' death, because of Christie's dealings over the sale of Bahamian property on the island of [[New Providence]], which was scheduled to be used for a new airfield by the [[Royal Air Force]], a project of which the Duke of Windsor would certainly have been aware and involved with, since it had important strategic and economic implications, and would involve large expenses. Christie, a member of the colony's House of Assembly, had been a dinner guest at Oakes' home on the evening the murder occurred, and had stayed overnight in Oakes' home on many previous occasions. Christie said that he had slept in a bedroom the night of the murder, only a few metres away from that of Oakes on the night of the murder, and claimed he had neither heard nor seen anything suspicious. Christie had to take the witness stand for an extended period during the de Marigny trial, and his testimony was not convincing to the jury. Christie was later [[knight]]ed for his contributions to the Bahamas, and died a wealthy man in 1973. He had apparently told close friends several years afterwards that he was directly involved in Oakes' murder.<ref>''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life'', second edition, by [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], 2005; chapter 'Death in Nassau', pp. 381-404.</ref>\n|- \n| 9\n| 1990\n| ''A Conspiracy of Crowns''\n| [[Alfred de Marigny]] and [[Mickey Herskowitz]]\n| [[Alfred de Marigny]]\u2014the accused killer in the Oakes trial\u2014wrote his own account, along with Mickey Herskowitz, published in 1990.\n|-\n| 10\n| 1994\n| \"[[Carnal Hours]]: A Nathan Heller Mystery\"\n| [[Max Allan Collins]]\n| Another fictionalized account concerning the death of Sir Harry, with speculations concerning the killer(s).

This book was written by experienced forensics author Colin Evans, who has written several prior similar books. Evans writes concisely and thoroughly in this volume. He examines in detail 15 of the most important and controversial forensics cases throughout history, including a chapter on the Oakes case: 'Alfred de Marigny', pp.&nbsp;90\u2013103. Evans focuses on the Oakes murder and its bungled forensics aspects, including a planted fingerprint, which, when brought to the murder trial of de Marigny, with precise and strong cross-examination by the accused's lawyer, proved decisive in securing de Marigny's acquittal.\n|- \n| 13\n| 2005\n| ''Blood and Fire: the Duke of Windsor and the Strange Murder of Sir Harry Oakes''\n| John Marquis\n| Marquis' book was described by American reviewer Art Paine as 'the best written of all the Oakes books to date' and by Sir [[Christopher Ondaatje]] in Canada's ''National Post'' as the most 'explicitly accusatory' of all the Oakes books. Marquis dismisses the Lansky theories, and claims the murder was strictly a local affair, with white Bahamian businessmen\u2014including Sir Harold Christie\u2014getting rid of Oakes to prevent movement of his vast fortune to Mexico, a move that would have undermined the Bahamian economy. Marquis, who was editor of Nassau's leading daily newspaper for ten years, also believes the Duke conspired to frame de Marigny by hiring two crooked Miami detectives to conduct the murder investigation. This, he maintains, was also to prevent inquiries by the FBI and Scotland Yard, who he feared would expose his own involvement in illegal money transfers to Mexico during wartime currency restrictions. Marquis makes two very significant revelations in support of his theories: one concerns a passport found amongst rubble in a Nassau street, the other a comment from the Bahamas police chief who was transferred to Trinidad and Tobago at the height of the Oakes inquiries (also used by other authors). He also cites the involvement of the Oakes' family lawyer, Walter Foskett, who he claims was robbing Oakes and was in dispute with him at the time of the killing. Blood and Fire was listed in the Wall Street Journal among the top five books about unsolved crimes.\n|- \n| 14\n| 2006\n| ''A Serpent in Eden''\n| [[James Owen (British author)|James Owen]]\n| Owen's book on the Oakes murder<ref>[[James Owen (British author)|Owen, James]].

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll. Her love for animals is a recurring theme, be it penguins,<ref name=\"Cold Duck\" /> koalas,<ref name=\"Back Out in the Outback\" /> dinosaurs,<ref name=\"Dinosaur Ducks\" /> or even the [[Yeti]].<ref name=\"Lost Crown of Genghis Khan\" /> Webby is typically wearing a pink shirt and a large hairbow, she is usually rather timid, and often has difficulties being accepted by the boys,<ref name=\"Bustle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/webby-vanderquack-has-a-bigger-role-in-the-ducktales-reboot-representing-adventurous-girls-everywhere-74642|title=Webby Vanderquack Has A Bigger Role In The 'DuckTales' Reboot, Representing Adventurous Girls Everywhere|first=Jack|last=O'Keeffe|publisher=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2018-07-15}}</ref> although she is also a capable Junior Woodchuck scout.<ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Webby is around the boys' age, being an intellectual [[nerd]] and somewhat of an athletic [[genius]], with her character wearing a pink and blue sweater vest, a purple skirt, and a smaller hairbow on her right-side. She is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and [[Clan McDuck]] historian who idolizes Scrooge McDuck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-ducktales-d23-expo-20170715-story.html|title='DuckTales' clip shows a whole new Webby Vanderquack|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=2017-07-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Having spent most of her life sheltered from the outside world by her grandmother (among the activities withheld from her prior to her befriending Huey, Dewey and Louie are theme park visits<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> and sledding<ref name=\"The Impossible Summit of Mt.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /><ref name=\"The Shadow War!\" /><ref name=\"Friendship Hates Magic!\" />\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar.

Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures.

She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y.

Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews. In \"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", it's revealed that his anger was rooted in a fear that the world was out to get him and that no one could understand him.

He eventually falls to his apparent death.<br />Since the movie, Merlock has made appearances in several general themed Disney media, including the video games ''[[Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' (the later in which he is voiced by [[Corey Burton]]).\n* '''Drake Von Vladstone'''{{Anchor|Drake Von Vladstone}} (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Drake Von Vladstone, alias [[Count Dracula]] Duck, is the final villain of the video game ''[[DuckTales (video game)|Ducktales]]'' and its remake ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''.
