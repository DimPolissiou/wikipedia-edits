A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n'''Books'''\n\n'''Western Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n'''\n\n'''Queensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n\n'''Essays'''\n\n'''Calibre Essay Prize (winner, 2007)  '''\n\n'''Wildcare Nature Writing Prize (winner, 2005)'''\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand list|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor a comprehensive list of Tredinnick's work, see his entry in [http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A14240?mainTabTemplate=agentWorksBy&from=0&count=20 AustLit].\n\n=== Poetry ===\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize''' \n Newcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n'''Books'''\n\n'''Western Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n'''\n\n'''Queensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''Montreal International Poetry Prize (the largest prize ever for a single poem;
