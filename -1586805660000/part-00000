Homeported at [[Naval Station Norfolk]], she operated in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] for the next two years, taking part in [[United States Navy Reserve]] training cruises, and [[anti-submarine warfare]] exercises.\n\nBeginning in 1947, when she sailed from Norfolk on 10 November, ''Harold J. Ellison'' added periodic cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] to her operations, helping to keep the peace and protect American interests in this area.

''Harold J. Ellison'' added a new function in January 1962, when she was assigned to [[Project Mercury]] as a part of the recovery unit in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1962, she underwent an extensive [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM I) overhaul at the [[Brooklyn Naval Shipyard]]. The destroyer rejoined the fleet in early 1963 and through 1964 continued to operate on training and readiness exercises off the Atlantic coast.\n\nOn 29 September 1965, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 24 and headed via the [[Panama Canal]] for the [[Pacific Ocean]]. She served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on \"[[Yankee Station]]\" in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], participated in \"[[Operation Sea Dragon (Vietnam War)|Sea Dragon]]\" operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out [[naval gunfire support]] missions during the [[Vietnam War]]. Leaving Southeast Asia by steaming eastward through the [[Suez Canal]], she completed her round-the-world cruise upon returning to Norfolk in April 1966. In July she entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for an overhaul which lasted for the rest of the year. After sea trials and refresher training early in 1967, ''Harold J. Ellison'' rejoined the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]]. She visited [[Brazil]] and crossed the equator on her way around Africa en route to the Middle East. During a port visit in [[Ethiopia]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was a guest aboard the ship. ''Harold J. Ellison'' also visited [[Kenya]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Pakistan]] and returned in March 1971.\n\nIn July 1971, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was assigned to DesRon 36 and operated mainly in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 July 1972, the destroyer was assigned to the DesRon 34 of the Navy Reserve. During the first half of 1973, she underwent an overhaul at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Following her yard period, she sailed the Caribbean Sea, visiting [[Port-au-Prince]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and [[Bermuda]].\n\nOn 19 July 1974, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea with the aircraft carrier {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}}. The destroyer was transferred to DesRon 30 on 30 November 1974 and her homeport was changed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. For her remaining career in the U.S. Navy, she continued to train reservists on cruises along the U.S. East Coast or to the Caribbean Sea. ''Harold J. Ellison'' was decommissioned on 1 October 1983. Together with {{USS|William C.

Ellison'' also visited [[Kenya]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Pakistan]] and returned in March 1971.\n\nIn July 1971, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was assigned to DesRon 36 and operated mainly in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 July 1972, the destroyer was assigned to the DesRon 34 of the Navy Reserve. During the first half of 1973, she underwent an overhaul at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Following her yard period, she sailed the Caribbean Sea, visiting [[Port-au-Prince]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and [[Bermuda]].\n\nOn 19 July 1974, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea with the aircraft carrier {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}}. The destroyer was transferred to DesRon 30 on 30 November 1974 and her homeport was changed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. For her remaining career in the U.S. Navy, she continued to train reservists on cruises along the U.S. East Coast or to the Caribbean Sea. ''Harold J. Ellison'' was decommissioned on 1 October 1983. Together with {{USS|William C. Lawe|DD-763|6}}, which was decommissioned on the same day, she was the last {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} in the United States Navy.\n\n===Transfer to Pakistan===\n\n{{other ships|PNS Shah Jahan}}\n\n''Harold J. Ellison'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 October 1983, transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed ''Shah Jahan'' (D-164). She was cannibalized for parts and sunk as a target vessel in 1994.\n\n== References ==\n* {{DANFS|https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/harold-j-ellison-de-545.html|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd864txt.htm}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat|USS Harold J.

Van der Walt and Michael Schmidt criticise the \"standard\" works on the overall history and theory of anarchism and syndicalism for focusing on the North Atlantic region, and for insisting upon an indefensible \"Spanish exceptionalism,\" the notion that in Spain alone were anarchism and syndicalism mass movements.\n\nA global view shows that Spain was by no means unique. According to Lucien van der Walt, \"once you look globally, you find mass movements of comparable, sometimes even greater, influence in countries ranging from Argentina, to China, to Cuba, to Mexico, to Peru, to the Ukraine and so on. What gets a bit lost in studies that focus on Western Europe is that most of anarchist and syndicalist history took place elsewhere. In other words, you can\u2019t understand anarchism unless you understand that much of its history was in the east and the south, not only in the north and the west.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |title=\"Fanning the Flames\" interview with Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt |access-date=2012-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |archive-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTherefore, besides movements like the Spanish [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], the book examines movements like the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina]], the [[Uruguayan Anarchist Federation]], the Shinmin autonomous region founded by Korean anarchists, and the Ukrainian [[Free Territory]] of [[Makhnovism]]. Attention is also paid to figures and movements partially influenced by anarchism, like [[Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino]], and the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], in southern Africa.\n\n''Black Flame'' also examines anarchist and syndicalist ideas and debates globally: for example, the account of anarchist debates on whether the [[Soviet Union]] was \"[[state capitalist]]\" includes the views of Asian anarchists, while sections on anarchism, syndicalism and race include coverage of Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian, and South African materials and movements.\n\n== ''Black Flame'' and a global anarchist/ syndicalist canon ==\n\n''Black Flame'' argues that [[East Europeans]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] are the two most important anarchist thinkers. However, the book insists that globally \"the movement had an amazing array of writers and thinkers, truly cosmopolitan.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nThe anarchist and syndicalist canon must be understood as a \"global\" one, that must \"include figures from within but also without the West,\" ideally including figures like Li Pei Kan ([[Ba Jin]]) and [[Liu Shifu]](\u201cShifu\u201d) of China, [[James Connolly]] of Ireland, Armando Borghi and [[Errico Malatesta]] of Italy, [[Nestor Makhno]] and [[Piotr Arshinov]], of the Ukraine, [[Juana Rouco Buela]] of Argentina, [[Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Saornil]] and Jaime Balius of Spain, [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]], [[Juana Bel\u00e9n Guti\u00e9rrez de Mendoza]], Antonio Gomes y Soto and [[Pr\u00e1xedis Guerrero]] of Mexico, [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] of the Netherlands, [[\u014csugi Sakae]], [[K\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui]] and [[Kanno Sugako]] of Japan, [[Lucy Parsons]] and [[Emma Goldman]] of the United States, Enrique Roig de San Mart\u00edn of Cuba, [[Shin Chaeho]] and [[Kim Jwa-jin]] of Korea, [[Rudolph Rocker]] of Germany, Neno Vasco and [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] of Brazil, [[Abraham Guill\u00e9n]] of Spain and Uruguay, and S.P.

Regarding the so-called \u201c[[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical]], individualist, [[Anarchism and religion|spiritual]] and \u2018[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle]]\u2019 traditions,\u201d the authors say \u201cwe do not regard these currents as part of the broad anarchist tradition.\u201d<ref name=\"review\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Deric_Shannon__A_Flame_to_Extenguish_Capital__Review_of_Black_Flame.html A Flame to Extenguish Capital: Review of Black Flame by Deric Shannon]</ref>\n\n''Black Flame'' insists that while anarchism owes an immense debt to the earlier current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and to [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], it cannot be reduced to, or conflated with, Mutualism. For example, its stresses class struggle and social revolution, unlike Mutualism, which envisaged gradual change through building cooperatives.\n\nThe book argues that there are no rational or historical grounds for including currents like Stirnerism and Mutualism in the anarchist tradition.\n\nSome studies do this, by defining anarchism as basically an anti-statist movement (this sort of approach can be found, for example, on Wikipedia at [[Anarchist schools of thought]]). However, the authors argue, if this was true, then [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[economic liberalism]] must also be considered \"anarchist,\" as one aims at the \"withering away of the state\" and the other, at a massive reduction in state control. These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.\n\nRather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.\n\nAnarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.\n\nFurther, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.\n\nIt is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.\n\n== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==\n\nVan der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nFor the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.\u201d<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nA key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.\n\nThey go on that \u201c[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action \u2013 \u2018propaganda by the deed\u2019 \u2013 as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge\u201d by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\n== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==\n\n''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement.\n\n== The authors ==\n\nThe authors are South Africans.\n\nMichael Schmidt, a senior journalist with an activist background, is now a journalism trainer.\n\n[[Lucien van der Walt]], an industrial sociologist who works on labour and left movements and capitalist restructuring, also has an activist background.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20171119063336/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/black-flame-the-revolutionary-class-politics-of-anarchism-and-syndicalism-%E2%80%94-book-excerpt/ An excerpt from the book, plus the contents pages]\n*[http://black-flame-anarchism.blogspot.com/A blog on ''Black Flame'', including many reviews, news on launches, short articles and debates]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ \"Fanning the Flames\": Interview with the authors, Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt]\n*[http://lucienvanderwalt.wordpress.com/ Various writings by co-author Lucien van der Walt]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html Exchange on ''Black Flame'' with ''[[Anarchist Studies]]'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt]\n*[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/c2frv6 Review of the book by 'M.

Regarding the so-called \u201c[[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical]], individualist, [[Anarchism and religion|spiritual]] and \u2018[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle]]\u2019 traditions,\u201d the authors say \u201cwe do not regard these currents as part of the broad anarchist tradition.\u201d<ref name=\"review\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Deric_Shannon__A_Flame_to_Extenguish_Capital__Review_of_Black_Flame.html A Flame to Extenguish Capital: Review of Black Flame by Deric Shannon]</ref>\n\n''Black Flame'' insists that while anarchism owes an immense debt to the earlier current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and to [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], it cannot be reduced to, or conflated with, Mutualism. For example, its stresses class struggle and social revolution, unlike Mutualism, which envisaged gradual change through building cooperatives.\n\nThe book argues that there are no rational or historical grounds for including currents like Stirnerism and Mutualism in the anarchist tradition.\n\nSome studies do this, by defining anarchism as basically an anti-statist movement (this sort of approach can be found, for example, on Wikipedia at [[Anarchist schools of thought]]). However, the authors argue, if this was true, then [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[economic liberalism]] must also be considered \"anarchist,\" as one aims at the \"withering away of the state\" and the other, at a massive reduction in state control. These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.\n\nRather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.\n\nAnarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.\n\nFurther, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.\n\nIt is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.\n\n== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==\n\nVan der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nFor the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.\u201d<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nA key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.\n\nThey go on that \u201c[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action \u2013 \u2018propaganda by the deed\u2019 \u2013 as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge\u201d by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\n== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==\n\n''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement.\n\n== The authors ==\n\nThe authors are South Africans.\n\nMichael Schmidt, a senior journalist with an activist background, is now a journalism trainer.\n\n[[Lucien van der Walt]], an industrial sociologist who works on labour and left movements and capitalist restructuring, also has an activist background.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20171119063336/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/black-flame-the-revolutionary-class-politics-of-anarchism-and-syndicalism-%E2%80%94-book-excerpt/ An excerpt from the book, plus the contents pages]\n*[http://black-flame-anarchism.blogspot.com/A blog on ''Black Flame'', including many reviews, news on launches, short articles and debates]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ \"Fanning the Flames\": Interview with the authors, Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt]\n*[http://lucienvanderwalt.wordpress.com/ Various writings by co-author Lucien van der Walt]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html Exchange on ''Black Flame'' with ''[[Anarchist Studies]]'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt]\n*[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/c2frv6 Review of the book by 'M.

Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\" /> This method was used until 1940, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Notable milestones===\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAt the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\n\nPerhaps the most widely seen [[streaking|streaker]] in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, \"Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?\" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.<ref>{{cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |author=Steve Harvey |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html }}</ref> \n\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |title=Disney hoping to win first Oscar for Best Animated Feature |date=February 28, 2014 |work=New York Post |access-date=April 18, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053447/https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSince 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\nTraditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.\n\n''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the [[2020 Oscars|February 9, 2020 award ceremony]].<ref>Farhi, Paul (February 10, 2020).

The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |title=How Are Oscar Nominees Chosen? |date=January 24, 2017  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180722072631/http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |url-status=live |first = Sean|last = Hutchinson|work = Mental Floss}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |title=The men who are counting on Oscar |work=BBC News |first=Jackie |last=Finlay |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate= April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter Meet the only two people in the world who already know all the Oscar winners {{!}} Market Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150240/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |date=February 27, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nAll AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees.

First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering a one-year period starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10&nbsp;pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.<ref name=92Rule11/><ref name=92Rule19>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Nineteen: Special Rules for the Short Film Awards |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]].

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]].

The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=June 11, 2019|website=HuffPost|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

The only difference is that ''Parasite'' doesn't belong to the romantic genre.\" Some Tamil netizens agreed that the plot of the film is similar to ''Minsara Kanna''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parasite plagiarism row: Minsara Kanna producer PL Thenappan sends intimation mail |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/parasite-plagiarism-row-minsara-kanna-producer-pl-thenappan-sends-intimation-mail-1647884-2020-02-19 |website=India Today |accessdate=February 22, 2020  |date=February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Disqualifications===\nNine films have been disqualified before an official award ceremony because they violated the regulations:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |title=9 Oscar Nominations That Were Revoked |last=Obias |first=Rudie |website=mentalfloss.com |publisher=Mental Floss |date=February 23, 2019 |access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]'' (1928) \u2013 The film was voluntarily removed by the Academy from competitive categories, to award Charlie Chaplin a special award.\n* ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) \u2013 Removed from the Best Story ballot after letters from the producer and nominee questioned its inclusion in the category.\n* ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955) \u2013 Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the [[High Society (1956 film)|1956 movie]] of the same title.\n* ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) \u2013 Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that [[Nino Rota|the score's composer]] had written for an earlier film.

Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927\u201328 period. The ceremony ran for 15&nbsp;minutes.\n\nWinners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\" /> This method was used until 1940, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Notable milestones===\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAt the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\n\nPerhaps the most widely seen [[streaking|streaker]] in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, \"Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?\" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.<ref>{{cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |author=Steve Harvey |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html }}</ref> \n\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |title=Disney hoping to win first Oscar for Best Animated Feature |date=February 28, 2014 |work=New York Post |access-date=April 18, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053447/https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSince 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\nTraditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.\n\n''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the [[2020 Oscars|February 9, 2020 award ceremony]].<ref>Farhi, Paul (February 10, 2020).

Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards).

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971\u201375),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archivedate=February 2, 2017|url-status = live}}</ref> The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=June 11, 2019|website=HuffPost|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced at [[Otakon]] 2013, that [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] has rescued ''Argento Soma'', along with a handful of other former BEI titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, The Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the title is stylized as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u03a0\u0397\u0395\u039d\u03a4\u039f \u03a3\u039f\u039c\u0391}}; this is a misspelling of the [[Greek language|Greek]] title, which was supposed to be written as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u03a1\u0393\u0388\u039d\u03a4\u039f \u03a3\u038f\u039c\u0391}}, which means \"The Silver Body\".\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an effort to learn more about the metallic aliens that have been plaguing the planet for the past years, Dr. Noguchi and his assistant Maki Agata try to bring to life a construct pieced together from the destroyed aliens. They recruit Takuto Kaneshiro, Maki's boyfriend at the college they both attend, into this project because of his talent for metallurgy. While Takuto is unhappy with Maki keeping secrets from him again, he reluctantly helps with the project. However, in the process of reviving the monster that Dr. Noguchi has aptly called Frank (short for [[Frankenstein's monster]]), unidentified soldiers invade the MORGUE facility. They cut the power, leading to a power surge which violently brings Frank to life and causes an explosion that kills everyone, including Dr. Noguchi and Maki, in the facility, except Takuto.\n\n\"Mr. X\" visits the scarred (emotionally and physically) Takuto in the hospital, and offers him a chance to get his vengeance on the monster he blames for killing Maki and destroying his life. Months later Lt. Ryu Soma is reborn from the ashes of Takuto's soul, as a military pilot who joins FUNERAL. This is the organization which deals with the attacking aliens, and has also recaptured Frank (who escaped after the explosion at MORGUE).\n\nIt quickly becomes clear that Ryu knows how to operate FUNERAL's SARGs. Suspicions arises from Dan as Ryu has more in his background than meets the eyes.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear that Frank has become the best weapon FUNERAL has to defend against the aliens, which leaves Ryu torn between revenge and the desire to protect his comrades. Further complicating the picture, the only person who can communicate with Frank is a young girl named Hattie (Harriet), who bears a striking resemblance to Ryu/Takuto's lost love Maki. As it becomes apparent that Frank is more than a simple monster, Ryu and his FUNERAL comrades have to come to terms with questions of human identity, grief, and loss.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Japanese cast===\n* [[Houko Kuwashima]] as Harriet \"Hattie\" Bartholomew/Maki Agata\n* [[Souichiro Hoshi]] as Takuto Kaneshiro/Ryu Soma\n* [[Jouji Nakata]] as Michael Heartland\n* [[Kikuko Inoue]] as Guinevere Green\n* Sayuri as Lana Ines\n* [[Takehito Koyasu]] as Dan Simmonds\n* [[Y\u016bji Takada]] as Frank, Yuri Leonov, Defense Official, Henry Harris\n* [[Yui Horie]] as Sue Harris\n\n=== English cast ===\n* Stephen Apostolina - Army Official B\n* [[Beau Billingslea]] - Captain Michael Heartland\n* [[Richard Cansino]] - Mr. X (or Edward Lawrence)\n* [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] - Maki Agata\n* [[Lynn Fischer]] - P.A., Kroka Leonov\n* [[Sandy Fox]] - Harriet 'Hattie' Bartholomew\n* [[Crispin Freeman]] - Morgue Military Official, First Lt.

Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced at [[Otakon]] 2013, that [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] has rescued ''Argento Soma'', along with a handful of other former BEI titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, The Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the title is stylized as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u03a0\u0397\u0395\u039d\u03a4\u039f \u03a3\u039f\u039c\u0391}}; this is a misspelling of the [[Greek language|Greek]] title, which was supposed to be written as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u03a1\u0393\u0388\u039d\u03a4\u039f \u03a3\u038f\u039c\u0391}}, which means \"The Silver Body\".\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an effort to learn more about the metallic aliens that have been plaguing the planet for the past years, Dr. Noguchi and his assistant Maki Agata try to bring to life a construct pieced together from the destroyed aliens. They recruit Takuto Kaneshiro, Maki's boyfriend at the college they both attend, into this project because of his talent for metallurgy. While Takuto is unhappy with Maki keeping secrets from him again, he reluctantly helps with the project. However, in the process of reviving the monster that Dr. Noguchi has aptly called Frank (short for [[Frankenstein's monster]]), unidentified soldiers invade the MORGUE facility. They cut the power, leading to a power surge which violently brings Frank to life and causes an explosion that kills everyone, including Dr. Noguchi and Maki, in the facility, except Takuto.\n\n\"Mr. X\" visits the scarred (emotionally and physically) Takuto in the hospital, and offers him a chance to get his vengeance on the monster he blames for killing Maki and destroying his life. Months later Lt. Ryu Soma is reborn from the ashes of Takuto's soul, as a military pilot who joins FUNERAL. This is the organization which deals with the attacking aliens, and has also recaptured Frank (who escaped after the explosion at MORGUE).\n\nIt quickly becomes clear that Ryu knows how to operate FUNERAL\u2019s SARGs. Suspicions arises from Dan as Ryu has more in his background than meets the eyes.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear that Frank has become the best weapon FUNERAL has to defend against the aliens, which leaves Ryu torn between revenge and the desire to protect his comrades. Further complicating the picture, the only person who can communicate with Frank is a young girl named Hattie (Harriet), who bears a striking resemblance to Ryu/Takuto's lost love Maki. As it becomes apparent that Frank is more than a simple monster, Ryu and his FUNERAL comrades have to come to terms with questions of human identity, grief, and loss.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Japanese cast===\n* [[Houko Kuwashima]] as Harriet \"Hattie\" Bartholomew/Maki Agata\n* [[Souichiro Hoshi]] as Takuto Kaneshiro/Ryu Soma\n* [[Jouji Nakata]] as Michael Heartland\n* [[Kikuko Inoue]] as Guinevere Green\n* Sayuri as Lana Ines\n* [[Takehito Koyasu]] as Dan Simmonds\n* [[Y\u016bji Takada]] as Frank, Yuri Leonov, Defense Official, Henry Harris\n* [[Yui Horie]] as Sue Harris\n\n=== English cast ===\n* Stephen Apostolina - Army Official B\n* [[Beau Billingslea]] - Captain Michael Heartland\n* [[Richard Cansino]] - Mr. X (or Edward Lawrence)\n* [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] - Maki Agata\n* [[Lynn Fischer]] - P.A., Kroka Leonov\n* [[Sandy Fox]] - Harriet 'Hattie' Bartholomew\n* [[Crispin Freeman]] - Morgue Military Official, First Lt.

Non-visible minorities such as newly arrived [[Eastern Europe]]ans and the new wave of [[Latin American]]s are also a feature of the city's ethnic landscape. Prior to the Hong Kong influx of the 1980s, the largest non-British Isles ethnic group in the city was [[German people|German]], followed by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n ethnicities.

The report published on these results stated, \"It is important to note that all Homeless Counts are inherently undercounts and that the 2011 Metro Vancouver Count was no exception.\"<ref name=\"Regional Steering Committee on Homelessness 2012\"/> Nonetheless, these counts can be used as indicators to determine homelessness trends within Metro Vancouver. Between 2002 and 2005, \"the count revealed that homelessness in the region nearly doubled from 1121 to 2174 persons\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\">{{cite journal|last=Fiedler|first=Rob|author2=Schuurman, Hyndman|title=Hidden homelessness: An indicator-based approach for examining the geographies of recent immigrants at-risk of homelessness in Greater Vancouver|journal=Cities|date=8 May 2006|volume=23|series=3|page=11|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/cities|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2006.03.004}}</ref>  From 2005 to 2008, the count revealed a much smaller increase in homelessness, from 2174 to 2660 persons. Thus, the count conducted in 2011 implies that the homeless population has remained relatively stable between 2008 and 2011.\n\nOf the homeless people surveyed in 2011, \"71% were sheltered in either an emergency shelter, safe house, transition house or temporary facility such as a hospital, jail or detoxification centre...while 29% slept in outdoor locations or at someone else's place\".<ref name=\"Regional Steering Committee on Homelessness 2012\"/> 74 of the 2,650 homeless persons counted were children \u2013 those under the age of 19 \u2013 who accompanied a parent who was also homeless. Furthermore, of the homeless youth surveyed, 102 individuals were under the age of 19, 221 between the ages of 19\u201324, and 74 whose ages could not be identified, for a total of 397 homeless. Adults constituted the largest cohort of homeless in Metro Vancouver with 275 individuals between the ages of 25\u201334, 328 between the ages of 35\u201344, and 397 between the ages of 45\u201354, for a total of 1,000 homeless. Lastly, seniors \u2013 those above the age of 55 \u2013 constituted 268 homeless people. Of the 2,650 people identified in the count, ages for 985 people could not be provided.\n\nHomelessness doesn't occur suddenly, rather it is a progression wherein an individual becomes part of the group of 'at risk' individuals, remains in this group for some time, and then, finally, becomes homeless due to economic hardships and social dislocation.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\">{{cite report|author=Eberle Planning and Research|date=April 2001|title=Homelessness - Causes and Effects: A Profile, Policy Review and Analysis of Homelessness in British Columbia|url=http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/pub/Vol2.pdf}}</ref> \"Contemporary definitions split homelessness into two broad groups: 'absolute' homelessness, which refers to persons or households literally without physical shelter, and 'relative' homelessness, which includes a range of housing situations characterized as being at-risk of homelessness.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\"/> Indeed, being classified as at-risk of homelessness does not imply that an individual or household will become homeless in the future, only that various pre-conditions exist that may lead to this.<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\">{{cite thesis|last=Fiedler|first=Robert|title=Geographies of Immigrants at Risk for Homelessness in Greater Vancouver|degree=M.A.|publisher=Simon Fraser University|year=2006|pages=108}}</ref> These pre-conditions include, but are not restricted to the following: people living in SROs (Single Room Occupancy), people living in rooming houses, and people paying more than 50% of their net income towards housing costs.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\"/> \"Two-thirds of responses from homeless individuals enumerated in a recent homeless count in Greater Vancouver cited economic reasons for their being homeless \u2013 with lack of income and cost of housing accounting for 44% and 22% of responses respectively.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/>\n\nHousing affordability has and continues to be the top priority housing issue Vancouverites must resolve. In 1996, a study published by BC Housing revealed that 25% of renter households in Vancouver pay 50% or more of their incomes to rent.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\"/> The core housing need model, developed by the CMHC, uses a threshold of households spending at least 30% of their income on shelter costs to illuminate households experiencing acute housing affordability needs. \"Moving from the 30% shelter cost-to-income ratio (STIR) used in the core housing need model, to a 50% threshold, typically reduces the number of households identified by more than half.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\"/> In 2001, Statistics Canada published a study using both the 30% and 50% thresholds to identify renters and homeowners facing unaffordable housing costs in Metro Vancouver. This study revealed that 8.1% of homeowners and 27.8% of renters exceeded the 30% threshold, while 4.0% of homeowners and 10.8% of renters exceeded the 50% threshold. More in depth still, this study also found that 18.5% of immigrants living in Vancouver exceeded the 30% threshold and 8.0% exceed the 50% threshold. Only 11.3% and 4.8% of Canadian born households exceeded the 30% and 50% thresholds, respectively.\n\nHeather Smith and David Ley found that in Canada's gateway cities, \"the appreciable growth of the low-income population during the 1990s was almost entirely attributable to the growing poverty of recent immigrants\".<ref name=\"Smith 2008 27\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Heather|author2=Ley|title=Even in Canada? The Multiscalar Construction and Experience of Concentrated Immigrant Poverty in Gateway Cities|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=25 June 2008|volume=98|series=3|page=27|doi=10.1080/00045600802104509}}</ref> They go on to state, \"adult immigrants who had landed in the previous decade endured a poverty rate of...37 percent in Vancouver\".<ref name=\"Smith 2008 27\"/> Immigrants, recent and old, therefore constitute a large proportion of households in Metro Vancouver considered to be at-risk of homelessness. Analysis conducted by Robert Fiedler revealed that, in 2001, \"29.1% of persons in households...in Greater Vancouver are below more than one CMHC housing standard, indicating that...some households not only must spend an unsustainably high proportion of their income on shelter costs, but must also live in overcrowded and/or substandard conditions to access housing\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/> Although many new immigrants to Canada come from educated backgrounds, many having bachelor's degrees, they are paid less on average than Canadian born individuals and \"Over the past 25 years, the incomes of recent immigrants to Canada have progressively declined relative to the native-born.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Eric|author2=Pacey|title=Changing Income Inequality and Immigration in Canada, 1980-1995|journal=Canadian Public Policy|date=25 June 2008|volume=29|series=1|page=19|jstor=3552487}}</ref>\n\nRecently, the City of Vancouver released a new strategy targeting homelessness and affordable housing. The strategy will be enacted in 2012 and will run until 2021, with the goal of ending street homelessness completely by 2015, as well as increasing affordable housing choices for all Vancouverites. The City of Vancouver indicates that from 2002 to 2011, \"homelessness has increased nearly three-fold\" from approximately 628 homeless in 2002, to 1,605 homeless in 2011.<ref name=\"City of Vancouver 2011\">{{cite report|author=City of Vancouver|date=June 2011|title=Vancouver's Housing and Homeless Strategy 2012-2021: A Home for Everyone|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10544993?ppg=1}}</ref> The strategy goes on to report that SRO rooms are increasingly being lost to conversions and rent increases even though SRO hotels constitute a majority of Vancouver's lowest income housing stock. As Robert Fiedler noted in 2006, \"renters are disproportionately located in the City of Vancouver, which contains only 27.8% of the area's total population, but 40.2% of all renters\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/> Furthermore, low vacancy rates in Vancouver's market rental stock, a decreasing new supply of apartments in recent decades, and a widening gap of household incomes and housing prices are just a few challenges that must be overcome. By 2021, the City of Vancouver hopes to enable 5,000 additional social housing units, 11,000 new market rental-housing units, and 20,000 market ownership units.<ref name=\"City of Vancouver 2011\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Metro Vancouver (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/PlanningPublications/PopulationbyReligionNHS2011.pdf|format=PDF|title=Metro Vancouver Population by Religion, 2011 NHS|website=Metrovancouver.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Christianity|Christian]]\n|value1 = 41.7\n|color1 = DodgerBlue\n|label2 = [[Irreligion|Irreligious]]\n|value2 = 41.5\n|color2 = Gray\n|label3 = [[Sikhism|Sikh]]\n|value3 = 6.8\n|color3 = DarkOrange\n|label4 = [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]\n|value4 = 3.4\n|color4 = Yellow\n|label5 = [[Islam|Muslim]]\n|value5 = 3.2\n|color5 = DarkGreen\n|label6 = [[Hinduism|Hindu]]\n|value6 = 1.8\n|color6 = Gold\n|label7 = [[Judaism|Jewish]]\n|value7 = 0.8\n|color7 = Blue\n|label8 = Other\n|value8 = 0.8\n|color8 = Red\n}}\nVancouver, like the rest of British Columbia, has a low rate of church attendance compared with the rest of the continent and the majority of the population does not practice religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/pdcoutts/leadership/Religion.pdf|title=Clark, Warren. \"Patterns of Religious Attendance\".|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wcr.ab.ca/news/2003/0407/attendance040703.shtml Babych, Art. \"Attendance Drops in Church\".

Non-visible minorities such as newly arrived [[Eastern Europe]]ans and the new wave of [[Latin American]]s are also a feature of the city's ethnic landscape. Prior to the Hong Kong influx of the 1980s, the largest non-British Isles ethnic group in the city was [[German people|German]], followed by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n ethnicities. Most of these earlier East European immigrant  are fully assimilated or intermarried with other groups, although a new generation of East Europeans form a distinct linguistic and social community.\n\n=== Chinese origins ===\n{{main|Chinese Canadians in Greater Vancouver}}\nThe first Chinese immigrants to British Columbia were men who came to \"the British Colonies of [[Canada]],\" as they called British Columbia<!--ref Barkerville Chinese Museum; Gold Mountain is a ref to California only-->, for the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] of 1858 and a decade later to work on building the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\n=== South Asian origins ===\n{{main|South Asian Canadians in Greater Vancouver}}\nIndian immigrants first arrived in Vancouver during the late 19th century.<ref name=WRHp124>Walton-Roberts and Hiebert, ''[http://www.cjrs-rcsr.org/archives/20-1-2/WaltonRoberts-Hieberts.pdf Immigration, Entrepreneurship, and the Family] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018124820/http://www.cjrs-rcsr.org/archives/20-1-2/WaltonRoberts-Hieberts.pdf |date=2014-10-18 }}'', p. 124.</ref> Most ethnic South Asians in the Lower Mainland are Punjabi Sikhs.

The report published on these results stated, \"It is important to note that all Homeless Counts are inherently undercounts and that the 2011 Metro Vancouver Count was no exception.\"<ref name=\"Regional Steering Committee on Homelessness 2012\"/> Nonetheless, these counts can be used as indicators to determine homelessness trends within Metro Vancouver. Between 2002 and 2005, \"the count revealed that homelessness in the region nearly doubled from 1121 to 2174 persons\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\">{{cite journal|last=Fiedler|first=Rob|author2=Schuurman, Hyndman|title=Hidden homelessness: An indicator-based approach for examining the geographies of recent immigrants at-risk of homelessness in Greater Vancouver|journal=Cities|date=8 May 2006|volume=23|series=3|page=11|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/cities|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2006.03.004}}</ref>  From 2005 to 2008, the count revealed a much smaller increase in homelessness, from 2174 to 2660 persons. Thus, the count conducted in 2011 implies that the homeless population has remained relatively stable between 2008 and 2011.\n\nOf the homeless people surveyed in 2011, \"71% were sheltered in either an emergency shelter, safe house, transition house or temporary facility such as a hospital, jail or detoxification centre...while 29% slept in outdoor locations or at someone else's place\".<ref name=\"Regional Steering Committee on Homelessness 2012\"/> 74 of the 2,650 homeless persons counted were children \u2013 those under the age of 19 \u2013 who accompanied a parent who was also homeless. Furthermore, of the homeless youth surveyed, 102 individuals were under the age of 19, 221 between the ages of 19\u201324, and 74 whose ages could not be identified, for a total of 397 homeless. Adults constituted the largest cohort of homeless in Metro Vancouver with 275 individuals between the ages of 25\u201334, 328 between the ages of 35\u201344, and 397 between the ages of 45\u201354, for a total of 1,000 homeless. Lastly, seniors \u2013 those above the age of 55 \u2013 constituted 268 homeless people. Of the 2,650 people identified in the count, ages for 985 people could not be provided.\n\nHomelessness doesn't occur suddenly, rather it is a progression wherein an individual becomes part of the group of 'at risk' individuals, remains in this group for some time, and then, finally, becomes homeless due to economic hardships and social dislocation.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\">{{cite report|author=Eberle Planning and Research|date=April 2001|title=Homelessness - Causes and Effects: A Profile, Policy Review and Analysis of Homelessness in British Columbia|url=http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/pub/Vol2.pdf}}</ref> \"Contemporary definitions split homelessness into two broad groups: 'absolute' homelessness, which refers to persons or households literally without physical shelter, and 'relative' homelessness, which includes a range of housing situations characterized as being at-risk of homelessness.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\"/> Indeed, being classified as at-risk of homelessness does not imply that an individual or household will become homeless in the future, only that various pre-conditions exist that may lead to this.<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\">{{cite thesis|last=Fiedler|first=Robert|title=Geographies of Immigrants at Risk for Homelessness in Greater Vancouver|degree=M.A.|publisher=Simon Fraser University|year=2006|pages=108}}</ref> These pre-conditions include, but are not restricted to the following: people living in SROs (Single Room Occupancy), people living in rooming houses, and people paying more than 50% of their net income towards housing costs.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\"/> \"Two-thirds of responses from homeless individuals enumerated in a recent homeless count in Greater Vancouver cited economic reasons for their being homeless \u2013 with lack of income and cost of housing accounting for 44% and 22% of responses respectively.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/>\n\nHousing affordability has and continues to be the top priority housing issue Vancouverites must resolve. In 1996, a study published by BC Housing revealed that 25% of renter households in Vancouver pay 50% or more of their incomes to rent.<ref name=\"Eberle Planning and Research 2001\"/> The core housing need model, developed by the CMHC, uses a threshold of households spending at least 30% of their income on shelter costs to illuminate households experiencing acute housing affordability needs. \"Moving from the 30% shelter cost-to-income ratio (STIR) used in the core housing need model, to a 50% threshold, typically reduces the number of households identified by more than half.\"<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 11\"/> In 2001, Statistics Canada published a study using both the 30% and 50% thresholds to identify renters and homeowners facing unaffordable housing costs in Metro Vancouver. This study revealed that 8.1% of homeowners and 27.8% of renters exceeded the 30% threshold, while 4.0% of homeowners and 10.8% of renters exceeded the 50% threshold. More in depth still, this study also found that 18.5% of immigrants living in Vancouver exceeded the 30% threshold and 8.0% exceed the 50% threshold. Only 11.3% and 4.8% of Canadian born households exceeded the 30% and 50% thresholds, respectively.\n\nHeather Smith and David Ley found that in Canada's gateway cities, \"the appreciable growth of the low-income population during the 1990s was almost entirely attributable to the growing poverty of recent immigrants\".<ref name=\"Smith 2008 27\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Heather|author2=Ley|title=Even in Canada? The Multiscalar Construction and Experience of Concentrated Immigrant Poverty in Gateway Cities|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=25 June 2008|volume=98|series=3|page=27|doi=10.1080/00045600802104509}}</ref> They go on to state, \"adult immigrants who had landed in the previous decade endured a poverty rate of...37 percent in Vancouver\".<ref name=\"Smith 2008 27\"/> Immigrants, recent and old, therefore constitute a large proportion of households in Metro Vancouver considered to be at-risk of homelessness. Analysis conducted by Robert Fiedler revealed that, in 2001, \"29.1% of persons in households...in Greater Vancouver are below more than one CMHC housing standard, indicating that...some households not only must spend an unsustainably high proportion of their income on shelter costs, but must also live in overcrowded and/or substandard conditions to access housing\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/> Although many new immigrants to Canada come from educated backgrounds, many having bachelor's degrees, they are paid less on average than Canadian born individuals and \"Over the past 25 years, the incomes of recent immigrants to Canada have progressively declined relative to the native-born.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Eric|author2=Pacey|title=Changing Income Inequality and Immigration in Canada, 1980-1995|journal=Canadian Public Policy|date=25 June 2008|volume=29|series=1|page=19|jstor=3552487}}</ref>\n\nRecently, the City of Vancouver released a new strategy targeting homelessness and affordable housing. The strategy will be enacted in 2012 and will run until 2021, with the goal of ending street homelessness completely by 2015, as well as increasing affordable housing choices for all Vancouverites. The City of Vancouver indicates that from 2002 to 2011, \"homelessness has increased nearly three-fold\" from approximately 628 homeless in 2002, to 1,605 homeless in 2011.<ref name=\"City of Vancouver 2011\">{{cite report|author=City of Vancouver|date=June 2011|title=Vancouver's Housing and Homeless Strategy 2012-2021: A Home for Everyone|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10544993?ppg=1}}</ref> The strategy goes on to report that SRO rooms are increasingly being lost to conversions and rent increases even though SRO hotels constitute a majority of Vancouver's lowest income housing stock. As Robert Fiedler noted in 2006, \"renters are disproportionately located in the City of Vancouver, which contains only 27.8% of the area's total population, but 40.2% of all renters\".<ref name=\"Fiedler 2006 108\"/> Furthermore, low vacancy rates in Vancouver's market rental stock, a decreasing new supply of apartments in recent decades, and a widening gap of household incomes and housing prices are just a few challenges that must be overcome. By 2021, the City of Vancouver hopes to enable 5,000 additional social housing units, 11,000 new market rental-housing units, and 20,000 market ownership units.<ref name=\"City of Vancouver 2011\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Metro Vancouver (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/PlanningPublications/PopulationbyReligionNHS2011.pdf|format=PDF|title=Metro Vancouver Population by Religion, 2011 NHS|website=Metrovancouver.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Christianity|Christian]]\n|value1 = 41.7\n|color1 = DodgerBlue\n|label2 = [[Irreligion|Irreligious]]\n|value2 = 41.5\n|color2 = Gray\n|label3 = [[Sikhism|Sikh]]\n|value3 = 6.8\n|color3 = DarkOrange\n|label4 = [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]\n|value4 = 3.4\n|color4 = Yellow\n|label5 = [[Islam|Muslim]]\n|value5 = 3.2\n|color5 = DarkGreen\n|label6 = [[Hinduism|Hindu]]\n|value6 = 1.8\n|color6 = Gold\n|label7 = [[Judaism|Jewish]]\n|value7 = 0.8\n|color7 = Blue\n|label8 = Other\n|value8 = 0.8\n|color8 = Red\n}}\nVancouver, like the rest of British Columbia, has a low rate of church attendance compared with the rest of the continent and the majority of the population does not practice religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/pdcoutts/leadership/Religion.pdf|title=Clark, Warren. \"Patterns of Religious Attendance\".|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wcr.ab.ca/news/2003/0407/attendance040703.shtml Babych, Art. \"Attendance Drops in Church\".

McLouth\n| products      = Low carbon and stainless strip steel\n}}\n'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]).

The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H.
