The final release of FreeBSD 2, 2.2.8-RELEASE, was announced on 29 November 1998. FreeBSD 2.0 was the first version of FreeBSD to be claimed legally free of AT&T [[Unix]] code with approval of [[Novell]]. It was the first version to be widely used at the beginnings of the spread of Internet [[Server (computing)|servers]].\n\n2.2.9-RELEASE was released April 1, 2006 as a fully functional [[April Fools' Day]] prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2006-April/001055.html |title=FreeBSD 2.2.9 Release Announcement |date= |accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==FreeBSD 3==\nFreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE was announced on 16 October 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/1998-October/000445.html|title=3.0-RELEASE is now available|date=16 October 1998}}</ref>.

FreeBSD 3.0 was the first branch able to support [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) systems, using a [[Giant lock]] and marked the transition from [[a.out]] to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] executables. [[USB]] support was first introduced with FreeBSD 3.1, and the first [[Gigabit Ethernet|Gigabit]] network cards were supported in 3.2-RELEASE.\n\n==FreeBSD 4==\n4.0-RELEASE appeared in March 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2000-March/000529.html|title=4.0-RELEASE is now available|publisher=lists.freebsd.org|date=14 March 2000}}</ref> and the last 4-STABLE branch release was 4.11 in January 2005 supported until 31 January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2006-October/004111.html |title=FreeBSD 4.x EoL announcement |publisher=lists.FreeBSD.org |date= |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> FreeBSD 4 was lauded for its stability, was a favorite operating system for ISPs and [[web hosting service|web hosting providers]] during the first [[dot-com bubble]],{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} and is widely regarded{{by whom|date=June 2015}} as one of the most stable and high-performance operating systems of the whole Unix lineage. Among the new features of FreeBSD 4, [[Kqueue|<code>kqueue(2)</code>]] was introduced (which is now part of other major BSD systems) and [[FreeBSD_jail|Jails]], a way of running processes in separate environments<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html|title=Jails|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref>.\n\nVersion 4.8 was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] by Matt Dillon to create [[DragonFly BSD]].\n<ref name=\"Dragonfly\">{{citation |url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2003-July/006889.html |title=Announcing DragonFly BSD! |first=Matthew |last=Dillon |work=freebsd-current mailing list |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==FreeBSD 5==\nAfter almost three years of development, the first 5.0-RELEASE in January 2003 was widely anticipated, featuring support for advanced multiprocessor and application [[Thread (computing)|threading]], and for the [[UltraSPARC]] and [[IA-64]] platforms. The first 5-STABLE release was 5.3 (5.0 through 5.2.1 were cut from ''-CURRENT''). The last release from the 5-STABLE branch was 5.5 in May 2006.\n\nThe largest architectural development in FreeBSD 5 was a major change in the low-level kernel locking mechanisms to enable better [[Symmetric multiprocessing|symmetric multi-processor]] (SMP) support. This released much of the kernel from the MP lock, which is sometimes called the ''[[Giant lock]]''. More than one process could now execute in kernel mode at the same time. Other major changes included an ''M'':''N'' native threading implementation called Kernel Scheduled Entities (KSE). In principle this is similar to [[Scheduler Activations]]. Starting with FreeBSD 5.3, KSE was the default threading implementation until it was replaced with a 1:1 implementation in FreeBSD 7.0.\n\nFreeBSD 5 also significantly changed the block I/O layer by implementing the [[GEOM]] modular disk I/O request transformation framework contributed by [[Poul-Henning Kamp]]. GEOM enables the simple creation of many kinds of functionality, such as [[Disk mirroring|mirroring]] (gmirror), encryption ([[GBDE]] and [[Geli (software)|GELI]]). This work was supported through sponsorship by [[DARPA]].\n\nWhile the early versions from the 5.x were not much more than developer previews, with pronounced instability, the 5.4 and 5.5 releases of FreeBSD confirmed the technologies introduced in the FreeBSD 5.x branch had a future in highly stable and high-performing releases.\n\n==FreeBSD 6==\nFreeBSD 6.0 was released on 4 November 2005. The final FreeBSD 6 release was 6.4, on 11 November 2008. These versions extended work on SMP and threading optimization along with more work on advanced [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] functionality, TrustedBSD security event auditing, significant network stack performance enhancements, a fully preemptive kernel and support for hardware performance counters (HWPMC). The main accomplishments of these releases include removal of the Giant lock from [[Virtual file system|VFS]], implementation of a better-performing optional libthr [[Library (computing)|library]] with 1:1 threading and the addition of a Basic Security Module (BSM) audit implementation called [[OpenBSM]], which was created by the TrustedBSD Project (based on the BSM implementation found in Apple's [[open source software|open source]] [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]) and released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]].\n\n==FreeBSD 7==\nFreeBSD 7.0 was released on 27 February 2008. The final FreeBSD 7 release was 7.4, on 24 February 2011. New features included [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol|SCTP]], [[Unix File System|UFS]] [[Journaling file system|journaling]], an experimental port of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[ZFS]] file system, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC4]], improved support for the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[CPU architecture|architecture]], jemalloc (a [[malloc|memory allocator]] optimized for [[parallel computation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD |first=Jason |last=Evans |url=http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf |format=PDF |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> which was ported to [[Firefox 3.0|Firefox 3]]),<ref name=\"FreeBSD-7-RELEASE\">{{cite web|url=//www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=FreeBSD.org|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> and major updates and optimizations relating to network, audio, and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2008/02/26/whats-new-in-freebsd-70.html?page=1|title=What's New in FreeBSD 7.0|first=Federico|last=Biancuzzi|date=26 February 2008|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=onlamp.com}}</ref> Benchmarks showed significant performance improvements compared to previous FreeBSD releases as well as Linux.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.FreeBSD.org/~kris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf|title=Introducing FreeBSD 7.0|publisher=FreeBSD.org|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> The new [[ULE scheduler]] was much improved but a decision was made to ship the 7.0 release with the older 4BSD scheduler, leaving ULE as a kernel compile-time tunable.

FreeBSD 3.0 was the first branch able to support [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) systems, using a [[Giant lock]] and marked the transition from [[a.out]] to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] executables. [[USB]] support was first introduced with FreeBSD 3.1, and the first [[Gigabit Ethernet|Gigabit]] network cards were supported in 3.2-RELEASE.\n\n==FreeBSD 4==\n4.0-RELEASE appeared in March 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2000-March/000529.html|title=4.0-RELEASE is now available|publisher=lists.freebsd.org|date=14 March 2000}}</ref> and the last 4-STABLE branch release was 4.11 in January 2005 supported until 31 January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2006-October/004111.html |title=FreeBSD 4.x EoL announcement |publisher=lists.FreeBSD.org |date= |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> FreeBSD 4 was lauded for its stability, was a favorite operating system for ISPs and [[web hosting service|web hosting providers]] during the first [[dot-com bubble]],{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} and is widely regarded{{by whom|date=June 2015}} as one of the most stable and high-performance operating systems of the whole Unix lineage. Among the new features of FreeBSD 4, [[Kqueue|<code>kqueue(2)</code>]] was introduced (which is now part of other major BSD systems) and [[FreeBSD_jail|Jails]], a way of running processes in separate environments<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html|title=Jails|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref>.\n\nVersion 4.8 was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] by Matt Dillon to create [[DragonFly BSD]].\n<ref name=\"Dragonfly\">{{citation |url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2003-July/006889.html |title=Announcing DragonFly BSD! |first=Matthew |last=Dillon |work=freebsd-current mailing list |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==FreeBSD 5==\nAfter almost three years of development, the first 5.0-RELEASE in January 2003 was widely anticipated, featuring support for advanced multiprocessor and application [[Thread (computing)|threading]], and for the [[UltraSPARC]] and [[IA-64]] platforms. The first 5-STABLE release was 5.3 (5.0 through 5.2.1 were cut from ''-CURRENT''). The last release from the 5-STABLE branch was 5.5 in May 2006.\n\nThe largest architectural development in FreeBSD 5 was a major change in the low-level kernel locking mechanisms to enable better [[Symmetric multiprocessing|symmetric multi-processor]] (SMP) support. This released much of the kernel from the MP lock, which is sometimes called the ''[[Giant lock]]''. More than one process could now execute in kernel mode at the same time. Other major changes included an ''M'':''N'' native threading implementation called Kernel Scheduled Entities (KSE). In principle this is similar to [[Scheduler Activations]]. Starting with FreeBSD 5.3, KSE was the default threading implementation until it was replaced with a 1:1 implementation in FreeBSD 7.0.\n\nFreeBSD 5 also significantly changed the block I/O layer by implementing the [[GEOM]] modular disk I/O request transformation framework contributed by [[Poul-Henning Kamp]]. GEOM enables the simple creation of many kinds of functionality, such as [[Disk mirroring|mirroring]] (gmirror), encryption ([[GBDE]] and [[Geli (software)|GELI]]). This work was supported through sponsorship by [[DARPA]].\n\nWhile the early versions from the 5.x were not much more than developer previews, with pronounced instability, the 5.4 and 5.5 releases of FreeBSD confirmed the technologies introduced in the FreeBSD 5.x branch had a future in highly stable and high-performing releases.\n\n==FreeBSD 6==\nFreeBSD 6.0 was released on 4 November 2005. The final FreeBSD 6 release was 6.4, on 11 November 2008. These versions extended work on SMP and threading optimization along with more work on advanced [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] functionality, TrustedBSD security event auditing, significant network stack performance enhancements, a fully preemptive kernel and support for hardware performance counters (HWPMC). The main accomplishments of these releases include removal of the Giant lock from [[Virtual file system|VFS]], implementation of a better-performing optional libthr [[Library (computing)|library]] with 1:1 threading and the addition of a Basic Security Module (BSM) audit implementation called [[OpenBSM]], which was created by the TrustedBSD Project (based on the BSM implementation found in Apple's [[open source software|open source]] [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]) and released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]].\n\n==FreeBSD 7==\nFreeBSD 7.0 was released on 27 February 2008. The final FreeBSD 7 release was 7.4, on 24 February 2011. New features included [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol|SCTP]], [[Unix File System|UFS]] [[Journaling file system|journaling]], an experimental port of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[ZFS]] file system, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC4]], improved support for the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[CPU architecture|architecture]], jemalloc (a [[malloc|memory allocator]] optimized for [[parallel computation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD |first=Jason |last=Evans |url=http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf |format=PDF |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> which was ported to [[Firefox 3.0|Firefox 3]]),<ref name=\"FreeBSD-7-RELEASE\">{{cite web|url=//www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=FreeBSD.org|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> and major updates and optimizations relating to network, audio, and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2008/02/26/whats-new-in-freebsd-70.html?page=1|title=What's New in FreeBSD 7.0|first=Federico|last=Biancuzzi|date=26 February 2008|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=onlamp.com}}</ref> Benchmarks showed significant performance improvements compared to previous FreeBSD releases as well as Linux.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.FreeBSD.org/~kris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf|title=Introducing FreeBSD 7.0|publisher=FreeBSD.org|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> The new [[ULE scheduler]] was much improved but a decision was made to ship the 7.0 release with the older 4BSD scheduler, leaving ULE as a kernel compile-time tunable.

They traveled via canals and the [[Great Lakes]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Detroit]] and arrived in August 1845. Sailing then on the ''Nelson Smith'', the settlers made their way to [[Saginaw]] and traveled over land to the present location the city of Frankenmuth.<ref name=\"historyofsaginaw\"/>\n\nThe purpose of the settlement was primarily religious; the Lutheran group planned to start a mission among the Native Americans.

With this proclamation, the event was moved into September to coincide with the opening of the Munich event. Also, for the first time in history, the world-famous Hofbr\u00e4uhaus brewery of Munich exported their beer to the United States.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.  [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]],  [[Coimbatore]] , [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]]  and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.

Nicobar]], [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Puducherry]], occupying 19.31% of India's area ({{convert|635,780|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.  [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]],  [[Coimbatore]] , [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]]  and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.
