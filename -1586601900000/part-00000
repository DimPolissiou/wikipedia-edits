It is the third in a series of sequels inspired by the 1972 novel and the original 1975 film ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the prologue, a docile man suddenly kills his wife in a violent method and then commits [[suicide]].\n\nSeveral months later, [[graphic artist]] Jodi and struggling [[author]] Mick Davison (Mills and Ontkean) move to Stepford, Connecticut, in the same house, hoping that life in the seemingly idyllic town will help rejuvenate their troubled marriage. Jodi reunites with old college friend Caroline (Williams) and meets the brilliant Dr. Borzage (Douglas) as well as the intimidating Miriam Benton (Fletcher), who heads a powerful women's group. Mick notices the docile men in the community, including Caroline's husband (who shows surprising moments of aggression), but befriends sloppy neighbor Gordon; both agree they are unnerved by the community. However, both Jodi and Mick are concerned when Gordon undergoes a radical behavior change after a stay at the Stepford Institute for Human Behavior, afterwards thinking only of his wife Lisa, but ignoring his son and other interests.\n\nCaroline subtly manipulates the Davisons and drugs Mick at a party.  When Mick reacts to the drug, Jodi is convinced that her husband has serious problems and commits him to the Stepford Institute for a cure. Mick is given mind-altering [[Behavior therapy|behavioral therapy]] and [[psychotropic drug]]s, altering him to behave docilely, but passionless. Jodi is concerned about the drugs Mick takes as part of the therapy; when she learns that the previous couple in her house (of the murder-suicide) was linked to heavy drugs, she replaces Mick's drugs with [[placebo]]s. The serious side effects of the treatment becomes clear, the men can become [[violent]], and Mick crashes and threatens to kill Jodi. They reconcile when he is convinced that she did not know of the Institute's motives or methods (in essence, Caroline had made the decision for Jodi). They plan to leave immediately.\n\nCaroline has learned of the Davisons' plan to leave town. With the other residents, Caroline captures them in their own house. Mick is returned to the Institute for reconditioning while Jodi is forced to escape to rescue Mick.  Benton allows Jodi to find Mick in the Institute but, with Dr. Borzage, plans to kill her. Borzage, however, is alarmed by the out-of-control [[ethics]] and kills Benton with a [[hypodermic needle]] meant for Jodi. Borzage then allows the Davisons to escape.\n\nIn the epilogue, the fate of the town is not revealed, but Jodi and Mick have returned to New York City. Mick has written a book about the experience and a movie will soon be made.\n\n==Production==\nThe film first aired on [[CBS]] on May 14, 1996. It was filmed in [[North Carolina]].\n\nIt is the third sequel in a string of stories based on the original concept of the novel. The first sequel, ''[[Revenge of the Stepford Wives]]'' (1980), starred [[Don Johnson]], [[Sharon Gless]], and [[Julie Kavner]] and suggested a similar drug-induced compliance. The second sequel, ''[[The Stepford Children]]'', (1987) starred [[Barbara Eden]] and hewed closer to the original. The third sequel basically reverses the roles, with the women being the oppressors. Louise Fletcher's role, in particular, recalls the role of Dale \"Diz\" Coba, the Men's Association president, in the original.\n\nThe executive producer for the film is [[Edgar J. Scherick]], who produced the first film.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said \"it's hard to care since this is about as shabbily done as you can get with a good-and-scary, tried-and-true idea.

{"title_page": "Subcategorization", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], '''subcategorization''' refers to the types of [[verb argument|argument]]s required or allowed by [[lexical item]]s (usually verbs).<ref>Chomsky (1965) is a prominent early source on the concept of subcategorization.</ref> The properties of a word that are crucial to their linguistic analysis are included in its ''lexical entry''.<ref name=\":0\">Grimshaw, J. (2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\nThe notion of subcategorization is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]],<ref>The valency concept in linguistics is originally from Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> although the two concepts (subcategorization and valency) stem from different traditions in the study of syntax and grammar.\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. In linguistics, we call these subcategorization frames and selection information. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic. \n\nBelow is an example sentence, \"The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa\", with a chart illustrating lexical entries for each word:\n''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<small>THEME</small>)}\n|}\n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

In April 2002, Lil' Kim stated in an interview that she had begun working with [[Dr. Dre]] in the recording studio. She told MTV, \"I've been talking to Dre a lot. And Dre and I are talking about possibly doing some collaborations. He's a cool cat. I love Dre. Our chemistry in the studio was just like, cool.

In the 19th century, spas were developed around mineral springs and served as vacation destinations for travelers. Some visitors arrived by railroad after one was built to serve the area. Among the planters who came to the spas with their families was [[Robert E. Lee]], the future Confederate general.\n\nBy the 1860s, the village was served by a railroad that became relied on by the Confederacy. After [[General Robert E. Lee]] retreated from Petersburg in 1865, he spent April 4 and 5 in Amelia Court House waiting for supplies from Richmond. Those supplies never arrived. Instead, a train came through carrying government documents.  The last major engagement of Lee's army with Union forces occurred April 6, 1865, on the border of Amelia County at the  [[Battle of Sayler's Creek]]. Lee surrendered in [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.\n\nAmelia's court clerks' offices contain records dating to before the Civil War, unlike many other courthouses that lost such records in wartime destruction. The Union forces were rushing to catch up to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and did not ensure the courthouse records were burned. The iron shutters and brick construction of the courthouse protected its contents. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.\n\nIn the 20th century, this area was still known for the [[amazonite]] produced at the Morefield Mine.<ref>[http://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DMR3/dmrpdfs/vamin/VAMIN_VOL38_NO02.pdf D.

In the 19th century, spas were developed around mineral springs and served as vacation destinations for travelers. Some visitors arrived by railroad after one was built to serve the area. Among the planters who came to the spas with their families was [[Robert E. Lee]], the future Confederate general.\n\nBy the 1860s, the village was served by a railroad that became relied on by the Confederacy. After [[General Robert E. Lee]] retreated from Petersburg in 1865, he spent April 4 and 5 in Amelia Court House waiting for supplies from Richmond. Those supplies never arrived. Instead, a train came through carrying government documents.  The last major engagement of Lee's army with Union forces occurred April 6, 1865, on the border of Amelia County at the  [[Battle of Sayler's Creek]]. Lee surrendered in [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.\n\nAmelia's court clerks' offices contain records dating to before the Civil War, unlike many other courthouses that lost such records in wartime destruction. The Union forces were rushing to catch up to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and did not ensure the courthouse records were burned. The iron shutters and brick construction of the courthouse protected its contents. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.\n\nIn the 20th century, this area was still known for the [[amazonite]] produced at the Morefield Mine.<ref>[http://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DMR3/dmrpdfs/vamin/VAMIN_VOL38_NO02.pdf D.

It is the second in a series of sequels inspired by the 1972 novel and the original 1975 film ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nLaura and Steven Harding ([[Barbara Eden]] and [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]]) move with their children to the town of Stepford, Connecticut where Steven had lived with his first wife who had died mysteriously.  While Laura is occupied with passing the [[bar exam]], Steven is disturbed by their children, athletic but unfocused David ([[Randall Batinkoff]]) and free-spirited, music loving Mary ([[Tammy Lauren]]). Steven joins the Men's Association, which is still assimilating their wives into robots. This time, they have begun to turn their out-of-control teens into robots as well. Once they are assimilated, the children are obedient, homework-loving, accomplished droids, but with little personality.\n\nThe Hardings befriend the Gregsons: Laura with sloppy and high-spirited mom, Sandy (Sharon Spelman), and David dates their sly-humored daughter, Lois (Debbie Barker), with whom he shares a love of [[motorcycle]]s. Laura is confused when the principal discourages her plans to establish a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]], and Mary feels unnerved by her passive classmates as well as (unknowingly) the methods used to collect her image, hair, and body information. At the school's Parents' Night, Laura becomes aware of the disconnection between her and Steven's parenting styles. She allows the children space, while he has become obsessed with a perfect image.\n\nOn the night of a dance, David, Mary, and Lois become suspicious when Sandy seemingly has changed, having become obsessed with cleaning and [[bundt cake]]s. They make the best of the dance, playing [[rock music]] over the local choice of [[big band]] and [[easy listening]]/[[Beautiful music|beautiful]] music, but cause a riot as the children dance awkwardly (never having been programmed to dance freestyle). The kids are arrested, but then released on Steven's and Mr. Gregson's vows to do something about them.\n\nLois calls David, upset, asking him to help her as all the men in town have gathered at her house and are \"coming for her\".  They escape on their motorcycles, but Lois crashes when a car tries to run them off the road. David goes to the hospital where Lois lies entirely wrapped in bandages.  When he sneaks into her room, he sees one of her limbs is missing in an unnatural manner as well as her vacant eyes, and he runs in fear.\n\nThe next day, Lois appears back to normal\u2014but she is now a mindless double who dates a boy she previously had dismissed. David and Laura visit the Gregsons where she witnesses the change in Sandy as well. Next, Laura finds that Mary has also changed after an evening's \"shopping trip\" with Dad, losing all her individuality and even doing some ironing. Laura digs open the grave of Steven's first wife and finds an android in the coffin.  Returning home, Laura learns Steven has taken David out for a \"shopping trip\" just before Mary's duplicate attacks her with a knife, but Laura is able to thwart the duplicate; as she throws it to the floor, it malfunctions.\n\nLaura goes to the Men's Association to find David; while investigating a greenhouse, she discovers the true Mary strapped to a table. They are surrounded by Steven and the other Men's Club members, as well as the bodies of the town's children, who are going through a bizarre bio-organic process to make them into docile drones. They are then  replaced by their robot doubles during the procedure.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh. He organized a solo sculpture exhibition at the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Dhaka]] in 1987.\n\nKhan received his first major international recognition when he was invited by the Olympic Committee in Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1988 to install an open-air sculpture at the [[Seoul Olympic Park]]. The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university.

This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park.

In 2001, he created a sculpture, composed of a group of freedom fighters, titled ''Bijoy Keton'' which was installed in the [[Dhaka Cantonment]].  In 2004, he created a sculpture titled ''Birds'', which was a delineation of birds in abstract forms, and was placed at the entrance of United Bhaban in [[Gulshan]], Dhaka. In the same year, the World Bank Bangladesh Country Office installed Khan\u2019s sculpture in the atrium of its office in Dhaka. The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka. The piece was titled ''Fish'', which depicts three fishes in spontaneous posture. The work remains as a popular artwork in public space in the busy neighborhood of Dhaka. Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]]. It has been installed in front of the [[Teacher-Student Centre, University of Dhaka|Teacher-Student Centre]] in 2007, and depicts a group of birds in different postures in abstract form. In 2011, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Bank]] to install a sculpture at the premises of Bangladesh Bank headquarters in [[Motijheel]]. The work was titled ''Unity''. It was a 32-feet stainless steel sculpture, featuring two hands in abstract form holding together a globe.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2010-12-05 |title=Time and Beyond |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-164736 |url-status= |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> \n\nKhan retired from the University of Dhaka in 2012.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet.
