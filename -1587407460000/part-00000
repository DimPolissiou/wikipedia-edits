Pawnee people are enrolled in the [[federally recognized]] '''Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma'''. Historically, they lived in [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].<ref name=ohs/> In the [[Pawnee language]], the Pawnee people refer to themselves as '''Chatiks si chatiks''' or \"Men of Men\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viola |first1=Herman J. |title=Warriors in Uniform: The legacy of American Indian heroism |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYXMqa1MYNsC&lpg=PA101&dq=Pawnee%20tribe%20Chaticks%20Men%20of%20Men&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q=Pawnee%20tribe%20Chaticks%20Men%20of%20Men&f=false |publisher=National Geographic Books |accessdate=1 January 2017|isbn=9781426203619 |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Pawnee lived in villages of [[earth lodge]]s with adjacent farmlands near the [[Loup River|Loup]], [[Republican River|Republican]], and [[Platte River|South Platte]] rivers. The Pawnee tribal economic activities throughout the year alternated between farming crops and hunting [[American bison|buffalo]].\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Pawnee numbered more than 60,000&nbsp;people and were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the west. Although dominating the [[Loup River|Loup (ickari\u02be)]] and [[Platte River|Platte (k\u00edckatuus)]] river areas for centuries, they later suffered from increasing encroachment and attrition by their numerically superior, nomadic enemies: the [[Sioux]] (or [[Lakota people|Lakota (p\u00e1hriksukat / paah\u00edksukat)]] (\"cut throat / cuts the throat\"), [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne (s\u00e1he / s\u00e1hi)]], and [[Arapaho|Arapaho (s\u00e1ri\u02beitihka)]] (\"dog eater\"); the Pawnee called these collectively as c\u00e1rarat (\"enemy tribe\") or cahriksuupi\u00edru\u02be (\"[[enemy]]\"). The Pawnee were occasionally at war with the [[Comanche|Comanche (raar\u00edhta\u02be)]] and [[Kiowa|Kiowa (k\u00e1\u02beiwa)]] farther south. They had suffered many losses due to Eurasian infectious diseases brought by the expanding Europeans, and by 1860, the Pawnee population was reduced to 4,000. It further decreased, because of disease, crop failure, and warfare, to approximately 2,400 by 1873, after which time the Pawnee were forced to move to Indian Territory in [[Oklahoma]]. Many Pawnee warriors enlisted to serve as Indian scouts in the [[US Army]] to track and fight their tribal enemies resisting [[European-American]] expansion on the [[Great Plains]].\n\n==Government==\nThere are approximately 3,200&nbsp;enrolled Pawnee and nearly all reside in Oklahoma.

[[Archeology]] studies of ancient sites have demonstrated the people lived in this pattern for nearly 700&nbsp;years, since about 1250&nbsp;CE.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\nThe Pawnee generally settled close to the rivers and placed their lodges on the higher banks. They built [[earth lodge]]s that by historical times tended to be oval in shape; at earlier stages, they were rectangular. They constructed the frame, made of 10\u201315&nbsp;posts set some {{convert|10|feet}} apart, which outlined the central room of the lodge. Lodge size varied based on the number of poles placed in the center of the structure. Most lodges had 4, 8, or 12&nbsp;center-poles. A common feature in Pawnee lodges were four painted poles, which represented the four [[cardinal directions]] and the four major star gods (not to be confused with [[Creator deity|the Creator]]). A second outer ring of poles outlined the outer circumference of the lodge. Horizontal beams linked the posts together.\n[[File:Pawnee lodge.jpg|thumb|Pawnee lodges near [[Genoa, Nebraska]] (1873)]]\n\nThe frame was covered first with smaller poles, tied with willow withes. The structure was covered with thatch, then earth. A hole left in the center of the covering served as a combined chimney / smoke vent and skylight. The door of each lodge was placed to the east and the rising sun. A long, low passageway, which helped keep out outside weather, led to an entry room that had an interior buffalo-skin door on a hinge. It could be closed at night and wedged shut. Opposite the door, on the west side of the central room, a [[bison|buffalo]] skull with horns was displayed. This was considered [[Shamanism among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|great medicine]].\n\nMats were hung on the perimeter of the main room to shield small rooms in the outer ring, which served as sleeping and private spaces. The lodge was semi-subterranean, as the Pawnee recessed the base by digging it approximately {{convert|3|feet|4=0|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=on}} below ground level, thereby insulating the interior from extreme temperatures. Lodges were strong enough to support adults, who routinely sat on them, and the children who played on the top of the structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Prairie Logbooks |last=Carleton |first=James Henry |authorlink=James Henry Carleton |year=1983 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6314-7}}</ref> (See photo above.)\n\nAs many as 30\u201350&nbsp;people might live in each lodge, and they were usually of related families. A village could consist of as many as 300\u2013500&nbsp;people and 10\u201315&nbsp;households. Each lodge was divided in two (the north and south), and each section had a head who oversaw the daily business. Each section was further subdivided into three duplicate areas, with tasks and responsibilities related to the ages of women and girls, as described below. The membership of the lodge was quite flexible.\n\nThe tribe went on buffalo hunts in summer and winter. Upon their return, the inhabitants of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations of support for the wife (and family they married into), but could always go back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When young couples married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Pawnee are a [[matrilineal]] people. Ancestral descent is traced through the mother, and children are considered born into the mother's clan and are part of her people. Traditionally, a young couple moved into the bride's parents' lodge. People work together in collaborative ways, marked by both independence and cooperation, without coercion. Both women and men are active in political life, with independent decision-making responsibilities.\n\nWithin the lodge, each north-south section had areas marked by activities of the three classes of women:\n*Mature women (usually married and mothers), who did most of the labor;\n*Young single women, just learning their responsibilities; and\n*Older women, who looked after the young children.\n\nAmong the collection of lodges, the political designations for men were essentially between:\n*the Warrior Clique; and\n*the Hunting Clique.\n\nWomen tended to be responsible for decisions about resource allocation, trade, and inter-lodge social negotiations. Men were responsible for decisions which pertained to hunting, war, and spiritual/health issues.\n\nWomen tended to remain within a single lodge, while men would typically move between lodges. They took multiple sexual partners in serially monogamous relationships.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe Pawnee women were skilled horticulturalists and cooks, cultivating and processing ten varieties of [[maize|corn]], seven of [[pumpkin]]s and [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], and eight of [[beans]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}\n<blockquote>They planted their crops along the fertile river bottomlands. These crops provided a wide variety of nutrients and complemented each other in making whole proteins. In addition to varieties of [[flint corn]] and [[flour corn]] for consumption, the women planted an archaic breed which they called \"Wonderful\" or \"Holy Corn\", specifically to be included in the sacred bundles.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote>\n\nThe holy corn was cultivated and harvested to replace corn in the sacred bundles prepared for the major seasons of winter and summer. Seeds were taken from sacred bundles for the spring planting ritual. The cycle of corn determined the annual agricultural cycle, as it was the first to be planted and first to be harvested (with accompanying ceremonies involving priests and men of the tribe as well.)<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn keeping with their [[cosmology]], the Pawnee classified the varieties of corn by color: black, spotted, white, yellow, and red (which, excluding spotted, related to the colors associated with the four semi-cardinal directions). The women kept the different strains separate as they cultivated the corn. While important in agriculture, squash and beans were not given the same theological meaning as corn.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn 2005, the last 25&nbsp;remaining seeds of the Pawnee Eagle Corn variety were successfully sprouted. The unique taste of Eagle Corn is described as being similar to almonds with cream. In November&nbsp;2010, a traditional Pawnee ceremony with Eagle Corn soup was held in Oklahoma. According to ''[[True West Magazine]]'', Eagle Corn soup had not been available for ceremonies for 125&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://truewestmagazine.com/keepers-of-the-seed/ |title=Keepers of the Seed |last=Bommersbach |first=Jana |date=2012-04-25 |magazine=True West Magazine |access-date=2018-03-07 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting===\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Pawnee Indians Migrating - Walters 37194066.jpg|thumb|Pawnee Indians migrating, by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\nAfter they obtained horses, the Pawnee adapted their culture and expanded their [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunting seasons. With horses providing a greater range, the people traveled in both summer and winter westward to the [[Great Plains]] for buffalo hunting. They often traveled {{convert|500|miles}} or more in a season. In summer the march began at dawn or before, but usually did not last the entire day.\n\nOnce buffalo were located, hunting did not begin until the tribal priests considered the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, but no one could kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.<ref>{{cite dictionary |first=W.P. |last=Clark |article=Hunt |title=The Indian Sign Language |location=Lincoln, NE |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1982 |orig-year=1885 |edition=trade paperback |isbn=0-8032-6309-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful kills, the women processed the bison meat, skin and bones for various uses: the flesh was sliced into strips and dried on poles over slow fires before being stored. Prepared in this way, it was usable for several months. Although the Pawnee preferred buffalo, they also hunted other game, including elk, bear, panther, and skunk, for meat and skins. The skins were used for clothing and accessories, storage bags, foot coverings, fastening ropes and ties, etc.\n\nThe people returned to their villages to harvest crops when the corn was ripe in late summer, or in the spring when the grass became green and they could plant a new cycle of crops. Summer hunts extended from late June to about the first of September; but might end early if hunting was successful. Sometimes the hunt was limited to what is now western Nebraska. Winter hunts were from late October until early April and were often to the southwest into what is now western Kansas.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Caeser Bruce silver comb 1984 ohs.jpg|thumb|Ornamental [[hair comb]] by Bruce Caesar (Pawnee-[[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]), 1984, of [[German silver]], [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\nLike many other Native American tribes, the Pawnee had a cosmology with elements of all of nature represented in it. They based many rituals in the four cardinal directions. Pawnee priests conducted ceremonies based on the [[sacred]] bundles that included various materials, such as an ear of sacred corn, with great symbolic value. These were used in many religious ceremonies to maintain the balance of nature and the Pawnee relationship with the gods and spirits. In the 1890s, already in Oklahoma, the people participated in the [[Ghost Dance]] movement.\n\nThe Pawnee believed that the Morning Star and Evening Star gave birth to the first Pawnee woman. The first Pawnee man was the offspring of the union of the Moon and the Sun. As they believed they were descendants of the stars, cosmology had a central role in daily and spiritual life. They planted their crops according to the position of the stars, which related to the appropriate time of season for planting. Like many tribal bands, they sacrificed [[maize]] and other crops to the stars.\n\n====Morning Star ritual====\nThe Skidi Pawnees in Village Across a Hill<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murie, James R. |year=1981 |series=Ceremonies of the Pawnee |title=Part&nbsp;I: The Skiri |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology |issue=27 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{rp|32}} practiced [[human sacrifice]], specifically of captive girls, in the \"[[Morning Star ritual]]\". They continued this practice regularly through the 1810s and possibly after 1838 \u2013 the last reported sacrifice. They believed the longstanding rite ensured the fertility of the soil and success of the crops, as well as renewal of all life in spring and triumphs on the battlefields.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|13}} The sacrifice was related to the belief that the first human being was a girl, born of the mating of the [[Venus|Morning Star]], the male figure of light, and the unwilling [[Venus|Evening Star]], a female figure of darkness, in their [[Creation myth|creation story]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|39}}\n\nThe ritual stood outside the organization of the ceremonial year and was not necessarily an annual occurrence. The commencement of the ceremony required that a man had been commanded to sponsor it while asleep.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Typically, a warrior would dream of the Morning Star, usually in the autumn, which meant it was time to prepare for the various steps of the ritual. The visionary would consult with the Morning Star priest, who helped him prepare for his journey to find a sacrifice. During the initial meeting both would cry and cry, because they knew the missions forced upon them by divine demand were wrong to carry out.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|115}} With help from others, the warrior would capture a young unmarried girl from an enemy tribe. The Pawnee kept the girl and cared for her over the winter, taking her with them as they made their buffalo hunt. They arranged her sacrifice in the spring, in relation to the rising of the Morning Star. She was well treated and fed throughout this period.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106\u2013118}}\n\n[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year ...\" (1907-1943) (19176154258).jpg|thumb|Miniature model of the Morning Star ritual, [[Field Museum]]]]\nWhen the morning star (either the planet [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], or some times [[Venus]])<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|38}}<ref name=Thurman1970>{{cite journal |author=Thurman, Melburn D. |title=The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star sacrifice of 1827 |journal=Nebraska History |year=1970 |pages=268\u2013280}}</ref>{{rp|footnote&nbsp;#4, p.&nbsp;277}} rose ringed with red, the priest knew it was the signal for the sacrifice. He directed the men to carry out the rest of the ritual, including the construction of a [[scaffold]] outside the village. It was made of sacred woods and leathers from different animals, each of which had important symbolism. It was erected over a pit with elements corresponding to the four cardinal directions. All the elements of the ritual related to symbolic meaning and belief, and were necessary for the renewal of life. The preparations took four days.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nMost of the actual ceremony took place in the earth lodge of the visionary, since the Pawnee villages did not have a special ceremonial lodge.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|14}} Bystanders outside dug holes in the wall and tore the roof apart to follow the elaborate ceremony.<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|120}} A procession of all the men and boys \u2013 even male infants carried among the men \u2013 accompanied the girl out of the village to the scaffold. Together they awaited the morning star. When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow from a sacred bow,<ref name=Murie1981/>{{rp|107}} then the priest cut the skin of her chest to increase bleeding. She was shot quickly with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried to the east and placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|106}}\n\nAbout 1820\u20131821, news of these sacrifices reached the East Coast; it caused a sensation among European Americans. Before this, US [[Indian agent]]s had counseled Pawnee chiefs to suppress the practice, as they warned of how it would upset the American settlers, who were arriving in ever greater number. Superintendent [[William Clark]] in [[St. Louis]] had pointed out the government's view on the ceremony to a visiting Pawnee delegation already in 1811.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal |author=Jones, Dorothy V. |year=1969 |title=John Dougherty and the Pawnee rite of human sacrifice: April&nbsp;1827 |journal=Missouri Historical Review |volume=63 |pages=293\u2013316}}</ref>{{rp|294}} Slowly, a Skidi faction that opposed the old rite developed.

With cavalry, steel weapons, and guns he had forced his way through the Apaches, Pueblos, and other nations of the modern southeastern US, but they had no gold. Coronado's interpreter repeated rumours (or confirmed Coronado's fantasies) that gold was to be had elsewhere in a location named [[Quivira]].\n\nAfter more than thirty days journey, Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], probably a few miles east of present-day [[Dodge City, Kansas]]. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear, but calmed down when one of Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language.\n\nCoronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling. He found Quivira \"well settled ... along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another\". Coronado believed that there were twenty-five settlements in Quivira. Both men and women Quivirans were nearly naked. Coronado was impressed with the size of the Quivirans and all the other Indians he met.

He summoned the \"Lord of Harahey\" who, with two hundred followers, came to meet with the Spanish. He was disappointed in his hopes for riches. The Harahey Indians were \"all naked \u2013 with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered\". Hyde identifies them as Awahis, the old Caddoan name for the Pawnees, possibly including the ancestors of the Skidis and the [[Arikara]]. Another group, the Guas, may have been known later as the Paniouace.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|33}} These people put up ferocious resistance when Coronado started to plunder their villages.<ref name=Winship1990/>\n\nIn 1601, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] led another ''entrada'' in search of the wealth of Quivira. He met \"Escansaques\", probably Apaches, who tried to persuade him to plunder and destroy \"Quiviran\" villages.\n\n===Arrival of horses and metal weapons===\nAbout 1670 the Apaches of the Southern Plains obtained horses and metal weapons in sufficient quantity to make them the dread of all their neighbors. For some decades the Pawnees were the victims of intensive raiding by large bands of mounted Apaches with iron weapons, and also by war parties of [[Chickasaw]]s and [[Choctaw]]s from the east who had firearms as well. The [[Dhegihan languages|Siouan]] groups that became [[Quapaw]]s, [[Osage Nation|Osage]]s, [[Omaha people|Omaha]]s, [[Ponca]]s and [[Kaw people|Kansa]]s also appeared on the Plains about this time, driven west by the expansion of the [[Iroquois]], and they too raided the Pawnees.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|54\u201356}} Archaeology indicates that pressure from hostile Apaches may have persuaded the Skidi Pawnees to move from their settlements on the [[Republican River]] to the upper [[Loup River]] in the course of the next century or so.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|43, 50, 51}} Their settlement pattern also changed from little villages of small rectangular earth-lodges to more defensible larger, compact villages of larger, circular lodges, the Skidis uniting in this way about 1680 while their close relations the Arikaras established a separate identity.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|51\u201355}}\n\n===Pawnees enslaved===\n{{main|Panis (slaves of First Nation descent)}}\nThe main form of loot was women and children, to be sold as slaves. In 1694, Apaches brought a large number of captive children to the trading fair in [[New Mexico]], but for some reason there were not enough buyers, so the Apaches beheaded all their slaves in full view of the Spaniards.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|46}} In [[French Canada]], [[Slavery in Canada|Indian slaves]] were generally called ''Panis'' (anglicized to Pawnee), as most, during this period, had been captured from the Pawnee tribe or their relations. Pawnee became synonymous with \"Indian slave\" in general use in Canada, and a slave from any tribe came to be called ''Panis.'' As early as 1670, a reference was recorded to a ''Panis'' in Montreal.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QBaTtGgyWakC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=Pawnee+slaves+in+Canada#v=onepage&q=Pawnee%20slaves%20in%20Canada&f=false |first=Carter Godwin |last=Woodson |date=July 1920 |title=The Slave in Canada |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013264 |access-date=17 November 2009}}</ref> By 1757 [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] considered that the Panis nation \"plays ... the same role in America that the Negroes do in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\">{{cite book |title=Canada's Forgotten Slaves |first1=Marcel |last1=Trudel |first2=Micheline |last2=d'Allaire |orig-year=1963 |translator=George Tombs |year=2013 |publisher=V\u00e9hicule Press |page=64}}</ref> The historian [[Marcel Trudel]] documented that close to 2,000&nbsp;\"panis\" [[slavery|slaves]] lived in [[Canada]] until the abolition of slavery in the colony in 1833.<ref name=\"Canada's Forgotten Slaves\" /> Indian slaves comprised close to half of the known slaves in [[French Canada]] (also called Lower Canada).\n\n===Pawnees acquire metal and horses===\n\nBy 1719 when [[Jean-Baptiste B\u00e9nard de la Harpe|de la Harpe]] led an expedition to Caddoan lands at the mouth of the [[Arkansas River]], the Pawnees had also acquired horses and metal weapons from French traders, and they were attacking Apaches in turn, destroying their villages and carrying off Apache women and children.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|57}} In 1720, [[Pierre Dugu\u00e9 de Boisbriand|Boisbriant]] reported that the Paniassas or Black Pawnees had recently captured a hundred Apaches, whom they were burning, a few each day.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|76}} de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Harpe planned to establish French trading posts at the mouth of the [[Canadian River]] and elsewhere in Caddoan territory, but this was not done and the Pawnee remained dependent on infrequent and casual traders, while their enemies \u2013 the Osages \u2013 benefited from a regular trade.\n\nIn 1720, the [[Villasur expedition]] was sent to the Pawnees in an attempt to wean the tribe away from their French connections (which had been greatly magnified in Spanish imagination). Guided mainly by Apaches, and led by an officer without experience of Indians, the expedition approached the Skidi Pawnee villages along the outflow of the [[Loup River]] into the [[Platte River]] in modern Nebraska. The expedition sent their only Pawnee slave to make contact; he did not obtain any welcome for the Spanish party and he shortly failed to return to the Spanish camp.

He reported that the Pawnee were a strong tribe and good horsemen, but, located at the far end of every trade route for European goods, were unfamiliar with Europeans and were treated like country bumpkins by their southern relatives. The mutual hatred between Pawnees and Apaches was so great that both sides were cooking and eating many of their captives.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|47}} Bourgmont's \"peace\" had little effect.\n\nIn 1739 the [[Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet|Mallet brothers]] visited the Skidi Pawnee. In 1750 the Skidis were reported to be ruled by a grand chief who had 900 warriors.\n\nFrom about 1760, [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out on the Great Plains, reducing the Skidi from eight large villages in 1725 to one by 1800.\n\n===Increasing contact with English-speakers, ongoing tribal warfare===\n[[File:Seymour Pawnees 1819.jpg|thumb|Pawnees in a parley with Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Long]]'s expedition at [[Engineer Cantonment]], near Council Bluffs, Iowa, in October 1819]]\nA Pawnee tribal delegation visited [[Thomas Jefferson|President Thomas Jefferson]]. In 1806 Lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]], [[Major G. C. Sibley]], [[Major S. H. Long]], among others, began visiting the Pawnee villages. Under pressure from Siouan tribes and European-American settlers, the Pawnee ceded territory to the United States government in treaties in 1818, 1825, 1833, 1848, 1857, and 1892. In 1857, they settled on the [[Pawnee Reservation]] along the Loup River in present-day [[Nance County, Nebraska]], but maintained their traditional way of life. They were subjected to continual raids by [[Lakota people|Lakota]] from the north and west.\n\n[[File:Sharitarish - Wicked Chief - by Charles Bird King, c1822.jpg|thumb|left|1822 portrait of [[Sharitahrish]] by [[Charles Bird King]], on display in the [[Library (White House)|Library]] of the [[White House]]]] Until the 1830s, the Pawnee in what became United States territory were relatively isolated from interaction with Europeans.

Like other groups of Native American scouts, Pawnee warriors were recruited in large numbers to fight on the Northern and Southern Plains in various conflicts against hostile Native Americans. Because the Pawnee people were old enemies of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche and Kiowa tribes, they served with the army for fourteen years between 1864 and 1877, earning a reputation as being a well-trained unit, especially in tracking and reconnaissance. The Pawnee Scouts took part with distinction in the [[Battle of the Tongue River]] during the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)]] against Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho and in the [[Battle of Summit Springs]]. They also fought with the US in the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]]. On the Southern Plains they fought against their old enemies, the Comanches and Kiowa, in the [[Comanche Campaign]].\n\n===Relocation and reservation===\n [[File:Cloud-Shield's winter count (Lakota). 1873-74.

On one such raid, 5&nbsp;August 1873, a Sioux war party of over 1,000 warriors ambushed a Pawnee hunting party of 350&nbsp;men, women, and children. The Pawnee had gained permission to leave the reservation and hunt buffalo. About 70&nbsp;Pawnee were killed in this attack, which occurred in a canyon in present-day [[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]. The site is known as [[Massacre Canyon]]. Because of the ongoing hostilities with the Sioux and encroachment from American settlers to the south and east, the Pawnee decided to leave their Nebraska reservation in the 1870s and settle on a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]], located in what is today Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1874, the Pawnee requested relocation to [[Indian Territory]] (Oklahoma), but the stress of the move, diseases and poor conditions on their reservation reduced their numbers even more. During this time, outlaws often smuggled whiskey to the Pawnee.

The Pawnee tribal economic activities throughout the year alternated between farming crops and hunting [[American bison|buffalo]].\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Pawnee numbered more than 60,000&nbsp;people and were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the west. Although dominating the [[Loup River|Loup (ickari\u02be)]] and [[Platte River|Platte (k\u00edckatuus)]] river areas for centuries, they later suffered from increasing encroachment and attrition by their numerically superior, nomadic enemies: the [[Sioux]] (or [[Lakota people|Lakota (p\u00e1hriksukat / paah\u00edksukat)]] (\"cut throat / cuts the throat\"), [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne (s\u00e1he / s\u00e1hi)]], and [[Arapaho|Arapaho (s\u00e1ri\u02beitihka)]] (\"dog eater\"); the Pawnee called these collectively as c\u00e1rarat (\"enemy tribe\") or cahriksuupi\u00edru\u02be (\"[[enemy]]\"). The Pawnee were occasionally at war with the [[Comanche|Comanche (raar\u00edhta\u02be)]] and [[Kiowa|Kiowa (k\u00e1\u02beiwa)]] farther south. They had suffered many losses due to Eurasian infectious diseases brought by the expanding Europeans, and by 1860, the Pawnee population was reduced to 4,000. It further decreased, because of disease, crop failure, and warfare, to approximately 2,400 by 1873, after which time the Pawnee were forced to move to Indian Territory in [[Oklahoma]]. Many Pawnee warriors enlisted to serve as Indian scouts in the [[US Army]] to track and fight their tribal enemies resisting [[European-American]] expansion on the [[Great Plains]].\n\n==Government==\nThere are approximately 3,200&nbsp;enrolled Pawnee and nearly all reside in Oklahoma. Their tribal headquarters is in [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]], and their [[tribal jurisdictional area]] is in parts of [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble]], [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne]], and [[Pawnee County, Oklahoma|Pawnee counties]]. The tribal constitution establishes the government of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. This government consists of the Resaru Council, the Pawnee Business Council, and the Supreme Court.

As was typical of many Native American tribes, each band saw to its own. In response to pressures from the [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]] and [[United States|Americans]], as well as neighboring tribes, the Pawnee began to draw closer together.\n\n===Bands===\n[[File:Pawnee01.png|thumb|Tribal territory of the Pawnee and tribes in [[Nebraska]]]]\n\n;South Bands: called ''Tuha\u00e1wit'' (\"East Village People\") by the Skidi-Federation\n* '''C\u00e1wii\u02bei''' (S.B. dialect), '''Cawi\u00ed''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Cawi''', '''Chaui''', '''Chawi''',<ref name=ohs/> or '''Tsawi''' (\u2018People in the Middle\u2019, also called \"Grand Pawnee\")\n* '''K\u00edtkehahki''' (S.B. dialect), '''K\u00edtkahaahki''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Kitkahaki''','''Kitkehahki''', or '''Kitkehaxki''' (\u2018Little Muddy Bottom Village\u2019, \u2018Little Earth Lodge Village\u2019, often called \"Republican Pawnee\")\n** Kitkehahkis\u00faraariksisu\u02be (S.B. dialect) or K\u00edtkahaahkisuraariksisu\u02be (Sk. dialect) (Kitkahahki band proper, literally \u2018real Kitkahahki\u2019 \u2013 the larger of two late 19th&nbsp;century divisions of the Kitkahahki band)\n** Kitkehahkiripacki (S.B. dialect) or K\u00edtkahaahkiripacki (Sk. dialect) (literally \u2018Little Kitkahahki\u2019 \u2013 a small Kitkahahki group that split off from the main band) \n* '''Piitahawiraata''' (S.B. dialect), '''Pi\u00edtahaaw\u00ecraata''' (Sk. dialect), variants: '''Pitahawirata''' or '''Pitahauirata''' (\u2018People Downstream\u2019, \u2018Man-Going-East\u2019, derived from ''Pita'' \u2013 \u2018Man\u2019 and ''Rata'' \u2013 \u2018screaming\u2019, the French called them \"Tapage Pawnee\" \u2013 \u2018Screaming, Howling Pawnee\u2019, later English-speaking Americans \"Noisy Pawnee\")<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|361}}\n** Piitahawiraata, Pi\u00edtahaaw\u00ecraata, Pitahaureat, Pitahawirata,<ref name=ohs/> (Pitahaureat proper, leading group)\n** Kawarakis (derived from the [[Arikara language]] ''Kawarusha'' - \u2018Horse\u2019 and [[Pawnee language]] ''Kish'' - \u2018People\u2019, some Pawnee argued that the Kawarakis spoke like the [[Arikara]] living to the north, so perhaps they belonged to the refugees (1794\u20131795) from [[Lakota people|Lakota]] aggression, who joined their Caddo kin living south)\n\n;[[Skidi|Skidi-Federation]] or Skiri:  the northernmost band;<ref name=ohs/> called themselves ''Ck\u00edrihki Kuuru\u00fariki'' (\"Look like wolves People\") and were known by the South Bands as ''Cki\u00edri'' (\"Wolf People\") (both names derived from ''Ckirir /Tski'ki'' \u2013 \"Wolf\" or ''Tskirirara'' \u2013 \"Wolf-in-Water\", therefore called ''Loups'', (\"Wolves\") by the French and ''Wolf Pawnee'' by English-speaking Americans),<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|463}} \n* Turikaku (\u2018Center Village\u2019)\n* Kitkehaxpakuxtu (\u2018Old Village\u2019 or \u2018Old-Earth-Lodge-Village\u2019)\n* Tuhitspiat or Tuhricpii\u02beat (S.B. dialect) (\u2018Village-Stretching-Out-in-the-Bottomlands\u2019, \u2018Village Across Bottomland\u2019, \u2018Village In The Bottoms\u2019)\n* Tukitskita (\u2018Village-on-Branch-of-a-River\u2019)\n* Tuhawukasa (\u2018Village-across-a-Ridge\u2019 or \u2018Village-Stretching-across-a-Hill\u2019)\n[[File:Pawnee father and son 1912.jpg|thumb|Pawnee father and son, 1912]]\n* Arikararikutsu (\u2018Big-Antlered-Elk-Standing\u2019)\n* Arikarariki (\u2018Small-Antlered-Elk-Standing\u2019)\n* Tuhutsaku (\u2018Village-in-a-Ravine\u2019)\n* Tuwarakaku (\u2018Village-in-Thick-Timber\u2019)\n* Akapaxtsawa (\u2018Buffalo-Skull-Painted-on-Tipi\u2019)\n* Tskisarikus (\u2018Fish-Hawk\u2019)\n* Tstikskaatit (\u2018Black-Ear-of-Corn,\u2019 i.e.\u2018[[Maize|Corn]]-black\u2019)\n* Turawiu (was only part of a village)\n* Pahukstatu or P\u00e1hukstaatu\u02be (S.B. dialect) (\u2018Pumpkin-Vine Village\u2019, did not join the Skidi and remained politically independent, but in general were counted as Skidi)\n* P\u00e1hukstaatu\u02be (Sk. dialect) (\u2018Squash Vine Village\u2019)\n* Tskirirara (\u2018Wolf-in-Water\u2019, although the Skidi-Federation got its name from them, they remained politically independent, but were counted within the Pawnee as Skidi)\n* [[Panismaha]] (also ''Panimaha'', by the 1770s this group of the Skidi Pawnee had broken off and moved toward Texas, where they allied with the Taovaya, the Tonkawa, Yojuane and other Texas tribes)\n\n===Villages===\n[[File:pawnee village soil resistivity image.jpg|thumb|left|Geophysical image depicting the subsurface archaeological footprint of Pawnee earth lodges and associated features, of a late 18th and early 19th&nbsp;century village.]]\nThe Pawnee had a sedentary lifestyle combining village life and seasonal hunting, which had long been established on the Plains. [[Archeology]] studies of ancient sites have demonstrated the people lived in this pattern for nearly 700&nbsp;years, since about 1250&nbsp;CE.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\nThe Pawnee generally settled close to the rivers and placed their lodges on the higher banks. They built [[earth lodge]]s that by historical times tended to be oval in shape; at earlier stages, they were rectangular. They constructed the frame, made of 10\u201315&nbsp;posts set some {{convert|10|feet}} apart, which outlined the central room of the lodge. Lodge size varied based on the number of poles placed in the center of the structure. Most lodges had 4, 8, or 12&nbsp;center-poles. A common feature in Pawnee lodges were four painted poles, which represented the four [[cardinal directions]] and the four major star gods (not to be confused with [[Creator deity|the Creator]]). A second outer ring of poles outlined the outer circumference of the lodge. Horizontal beams linked the posts together.\n[[File:Pawnee lodge.jpg|thumb|Pawnee lodges near [[Genoa, Nebraska]] (1873)]]\n\nThe frame was covered first with smaller poles, tied with willow withes. The structure was covered with thatch, then earth. A hole left in the center of the covering served as a combined chimney / smoke vent and skylight. The door of each lodge was placed to the east and the rising sun. A long, low passageway, which helped keep out outside weather, led to an entry room that had an interior buffalo-skin door on a hinge. It could be closed at night and wedged shut. Opposite the door, on the west side of the central room, a [[bison|buffalo]] skull with horns was displayed. This was considered [[Shamanism among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|great medicine]].\n\nMats were hung on the perimeter of the main room to shield small rooms in the outer ring, which served as sleeping and private spaces. The lodge was semi-subterranean, as the Pawnee recessed the base by digging it approximately {{convert|3|feet|4=0|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=on}} below ground level, thereby insulating the interior from extreme temperatures. Lodges were strong enough to support adults, who routinely sat on them, and the children who played on the top of the structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Prairie Logbooks |last=Carleton |first=James Henry |authorlink=James Henry Carleton |year=1983 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6314-7}}</ref> (See photo above.)\n\nAs many as 30\u201350&nbsp;people might live in each lodge, and they were usually of related families. A village could consist of as many as 300\u2013500&nbsp;people and 10\u201315&nbsp;households. Each lodge was divided in two (the north and south), and each section had a head who oversaw the daily business. Each section was further subdivided into three duplicate areas, with tasks and responsibilities related to the ages of women and girls, as described below. The membership of the lodge was quite flexible.\n\nThe tribe went on buffalo hunts in summer and winter. Upon their return, the inhabitants of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations of support for the wife (and family they married into), but could always go back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When young couples married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Pawnee are a [[matrilineal]] people. Ancestral descent is traced through the mother, and children are considered born into the mother's clan and are part of her people. Traditionally, a young couple moved into the bride's parents' lodge. People work together in collaborative ways, marked by both independence and cooperation, without coercion. Both women and men are active in political life, with independent decision-making responsibilities.\n\nWithin the lodge, each north-south section had areas marked by activities of the three classes of women:\n*Mature women (usually married and mothers), who did most of the labor;\n*Young single women, just learning their responsibilities; and\n*Older women, who looked after the young children.\n\nAmong the collection of lodges, the political designations for men were essentially between:\n*the Warrior Clique; and\n*the Hunting Clique.\n\nWomen tended to be responsible for decisions about resource allocation, trade, and inter-lodge social negotiations. Men were responsible for decisions which pertained to hunting, war, and spiritual/health issues.\n\nWomen tended to remain within a single lodge, while men would typically move between lodges. They took multiple sexual partners in serially monogamous relationships.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe Pawnee women were skilled horticulturalists and cooks, cultivating and processing ten varieties of [[maize|corn]], seven of [[pumpkin]]s and [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], and eight of [[beans]].<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}\n<blockquote>They planted their crops along the fertile river bottomlands. These crops provided a wide variety of nutrients and complemented each other in making whole proteins. In addition to varieties of [[flint corn]] and [[flour corn]] for consumption, the women planted an archaic breed which they called \"Wonderful\" or \"Holy Corn\", specifically to be included in the sacred bundles.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote>\n\nThe holy corn was cultivated and harvested to replace corn in the sacred bundles prepared for the major seasons of winter and summer. Seeds were taken from sacred bundles for the spring planting ritual. The cycle of corn determined the annual agricultural cycle, as it was the first to be planted and first to be harvested (with accompanying ceremonies involving priests and men of the tribe as well.)<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn keeping with their [[cosmology]], the Pawnee classified the varieties of corn by color: black, spotted, white, yellow, and red (which, excluding spotted, related to the colors associated with the four semi-cardinal directions). The women kept the different strains separate as they cultivated the corn. While important in agriculture, squash and beans were not given the same theological meaning as corn.<ref name=Weltfish1977/>{{rp|119\u2013122}}\n\nIn 2005, the last 25&nbsp;remaining seeds of the Pawnee Eagle Corn variety were successfully sprouted. The unique taste of Eagle Corn is described as being similar to almonds with cream. In November&nbsp;2010, a traditional Pawnee ceremony with Eagle Corn soup was held in Oklahoma. According to ''[[True West Magazine]]'', Eagle Corn soup had not been available for ceremonies for 125&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://truewestmagazine.com/keepers-of-the-seed/ |title=Keepers of the Seed |last=Bommersbach |first=Jana |date=2012-04-25 |magazine=True West Magazine |access-date=2018-03-07 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting===\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Pawnee Indians Migrating - Walters 37194066.jpg|thumb|Pawnee Indians migrating, by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\nAfter they obtained horses, the Pawnee adapted their culture and expanded their [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunting seasons. With horses providing a greater range, the people traveled in both summer and winter westward to the [[Great Plains]] for buffalo hunting. They often traveled {{convert|500|miles}} or more in a season. In summer the march began at dawn or before, but usually did not last the entire day.\n\nOnce buffalo were located, hunting did not begin until the tribal priests considered the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, but no one could kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off.

Prepared in this way, it was usable for several months. Although the Pawnee preferred buffalo, they also hunted other game, including elk, bear, panther, and skunk, for meat and skins. The skins were used for clothing and accessories, storage bags, foot coverings, fastening ropes and ties, etc.\n\nThe people returned to their villages to harvest crops when the corn was ripe in late summer, or in the spring when the grass became green and they could plant a new cycle of crops. Summer hunts extended from late June to about the first of September; but might end early if hunting was successful. Sometimes the hunt was limited to what is now western Nebraska. Winter hunts were from late October until early April and were often to the southwest into what is now western Kansas.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Caeser Bruce silver comb 1984 ohs.jpg|thumb|Ornamental [[hair comb]] by Bruce Caesar (Pawnee-[[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]), 1984, of [[German silver]], [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]\nLike many other Native American tribes, the Pawnee had a cosmology with elements of all of nature represented in it. They based many rituals in the four cardinal directions. Pawnee priests conducted ceremonies based on the [[sacred]] bundles that included various materials, such as an ear of sacred corn, with great symbolic value. These were used in many religious ceremonies to maintain the balance of nature and the Pawnee relationship with the gods and spirits. In the 1890s, already in Oklahoma, the people participated in the [[Ghost Dance]] movement.\n\nThe Pawnee believed that the Morning Star and Evening Star gave birth to the first Pawnee woman. The first Pawnee man was the offspring of the union of the Moon and the Sun. As they believed they were descendants of the stars, cosmology had a central role in daily and spiritual life. They planted their crops according to the position of the stars, which related to the appropriate time of season for planting. Like many tribal bands, they sacrificed [[maize]] and other crops to the stars.\n\n====Morning Star ritual====\nThe Skidi Pawnees in Village Across a Hill<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murie, James R. |year=1981 |series=Ceremonies of the Pawnee |title=Part&nbsp;I: The Skiri |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology |issue=27 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{rp|32}} practiced [[human sacrifice]], specifically of captive girls, in the \"[[Morning Star ritual]]\".

He directed the men to carry out the rest of the ritual, including the construction of a [[scaffold]] outside the village. It was made of sacred woods and leathers from different animals, each of which had important symbolism. It was erected over a pit with elements corresponding to the four cardinal directions. All the elements of the ritual related to symbolic meaning and belief, and were necessary for the renewal of life.

Before this, US [[Indian agent]]s had counseled Pawnee chiefs to suppress the practice, as they warned of how it would upset the American settlers, who were arriving in ever greater number.

With cavalry, steel weapons, and guns he had forced his way through the Apaches, Pueblos, and other nations of the modern southeastern US, but they had no gold. Coronado's interpreter repeated rumours (or confirmed Coronado's fantasies) that gold was to be had elsewhere in a location named [[Quivira]].\n\nAfter more than thirty days journey, Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], probably a few miles east of present-day [[Dodge City, Kansas]]. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear, but calmed down when one of Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language.\n\nCoronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling. He found Quivira \"well settled ... along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another\".

The Harahey Indians were \"all naked \u2013 with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered\".

For some decades the Pawnees were the victims of intensive raiding by large bands of mounted Apaches with iron weapons, and also by war parties of [[Chickasaw]]s and [[Choctaw]]s from the east who had firearms as well. The [[Dhegihan languages|Siouan]] groups that became [[Quapaw]]s, [[Osage Nation|Osage]]s, [[Omaha people|Omaha]]s, [[Ponca]]s and [[Kaw people|Kansa]]s also appeared on the Plains about this time, driven west by the expansion of the [[Iroquois]], and they too raided the Pawnees.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|54\u201356}} Archaeology indicates that pressure from hostile Apaches may have persuaded the Skidi Pawnees to move from their settlements on the [[Republican River]] to the upper [[Loup River]] in the course of the next century or so.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|43, 50, 51}} Their settlement pattern also changed from little villages of small rectangular earth-lodges to more defensible larger, compact villages of larger, circular lodges, the Skidis uniting in this way about 1680 while their close relations the Arikaras established a separate identity.<ref name=Hyde1951/>{{rp|51\u201355}}\n\n===Pawnees enslaved===\n{{main|Panis (slaves of First Nation descent)}}\nThe main form of loot was women and children, to be sold as slaves.

Guided mainly by Apaches, and led by an officer without experience of Indians, the expedition approached the Skidi Pawnee villages along the outflow of the [[Loup River]] into the [[Platte River]] in modern Nebraska. The expedition sent their only Pawnee slave to make contact; he did not obtain any welcome for the Spanish party and he shortly failed to return to the Spanish camp.

Like other groups of Native American scouts, Pawnee warriors were recruited in large numbers to fight on the Northern and Southern Plains in various conflicts against hostile Native Americans. Because the Pawnee people were old enemies of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche and Kiowa tribes, they served with the army for fourteen years between 1864 and 1877, earning a reputation as being a well-trained unit, especially in tracking and reconnaissance. The Pawnee Scouts took part with distinction in the [[Battle of the Tongue River]] during the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)]] against Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho and in the [[Battle of Summit Springs]]. They also fought with the US in the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]].

The Pawnee had gained permission to leave the reservation and hunt buffalo. About 70&nbsp;Pawnee were killed in this attack, which occurred in a canyon in present-day [[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]. The site is known as [[Massacre Canyon]]. Because of the ongoing hostilities with the Sioux and encroachment from American settlers to the south and east, the Pawnee decided to leave their Nebraska reservation in the 1870s and settle on a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]], located in what is today Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1874, the Pawnee requested relocation to [[Indian Territory]] (Oklahoma), but the stress of the move, diseases and poor conditions on their reservation reduced their numbers even more. During this time, outlaws often smuggled whiskey to the Pawnee. The teenaged female bandits [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]] and [[Cattle Annie]] were imprisoned for this crime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ranchdivaoutfitters.com/cattleannielittlebritches.html |title=Cattle Annie & Little Britches, taken from Lee Paul |publisher=ranchdivaoutfitters.com |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875 most members of the nation moved to Indian Territory, a large area reserved to receive tribes displaced from east of the Mississippi River and elsewhere. The warriors resisted the loss of their freedom and culture, but gradually adapted to reservations. On 23&nbsp;November 1892, the Pawnee in Oklahoma were forced by the US federal government to sign an agreement with the [[Cherokee Commission]] to accept individual allotments of land in a breakup of their communal holding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deloria |first1=Vine J.

The tribe reorganized under the [[Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act]] of 1936 and established the Pawnee Business Council, the Nasharo (Chiefs) Council, and a tribal constitution, bylaws, and charter.<ref name=ohs/>\n\nIn the 1960s, the government settled a suit by the Pawnee Nation regarding their compensation for lands ceded to the US government in the 19th century. By an out-of-court settlement in 1964, the Pawnee Nation was awarded $7,316,097 for land ceded to the US and undervalued by the federal government in the previous century.<ref>{{cite book |id=78 Stat. 585 (1964) |author=Wishart, David J. |year=1985 |article=The Pawnee Claims Case, 1947\u201364 |pages=157\u2013186 |title=Irredeemable America: The Indians' Estate and Land Claims |editor=Sutton, I. |location=Albuquerque, NM |publisher=University of New Mexico Press}}</ref>\n\nBills such as the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]] of 1975 have allowed the Pawnee Nation to regain some of its self-government. The Pawnee continue to practice cultural traditions, meeting twice a year for the intertribal gathering with their kinsmen the [[Wichita Indians]]. They have an annual four-day Pawnee Homecoming for Pawnee veterans in July.

If by the sea, they are called [[seaside resort]]s.  Inland resorts include [[ski resort]]s, [[mountain resort]]s and [[spa town]]s. Well-known resort towns include [[Punta Cana]] in [[Dominican Republic]], [[Bandipur]] in [[Nepal]], [[Bali]] in Indonesia, [[Sochi]] in [[Russia]], Mount Lebanon Tourism in [[Lebanon]], [[Barizo]] in [[Spain]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] in Italy, [[Druskininkai]] in [[Lithuania]], [[Canc\u00fan]] in Mexico, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and [[Key West, Florida]], in the United States, [[Ischgl]] in [[Austria]], [[St. Moritz]] in [[Switzerland]], [[Blackpool]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Malam Jabba]] in [[Pakistan]].\n\n[[File:HuvafenFushi.jpg|thumb|A [[resort island]] in the [[Maldives]]]]\nA [[resort island]] is an island or an archipelago that contains resorts, hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, and its amenities. [[Maldives]] is considered to have the best island resorts, which have become famous among the top celebrities and sportspersons around the world.\n\n[[File:Miamimetroarea.jpg|right|thumb|[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] in Florida]]\n[[Seaside resort]]s are located on a coast. In the United Kingdom, many seaside towns have turned to other entertainment industries, and some of them have much nightlife. The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater to local people, and the beaches still remain popular during the summer months.\n\nIn Europe and North America, [[ski resort]]s are towns and villages in ski areas, with support services for skiing such as hotels and [[chalet]]s, equipment rental, [[ski school]]s and [[ski lift]]s to access the slopes.\n\nResorts for different purposes also exist. An example is [[Yulara]], [[Northern Territory]], which exists to serve [[Uluru|Uluru (Ayers Rock)]] and [[Kata Tjuta|Kata Tjuta (The Olgas)]] in [[Australia]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Boutique hotel]]\n*[[Condo hotel]]\n*[[Destination club]]\n*[[Resort architecture]]\n*[[Sanatorium (resort)]]\n*[[Seaside resort]]\n*[[Spa]]\n*[[Vacation rental]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Resorts}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{tourism}}\n\n[[Category:Resorts| ]]\n", "name_user": "190.186.20.23", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort"}

This results in socially recognized abuse and bullying of younger people and children by elders in schools, institutes, and at home. Although the majority of Japanese society is proud of the traditional system,{{clarify|date=March 2018}} there are considerable minorities of people who do not agree with the system.<ref>[http://www.newsweekjapan.jp/reizei/2012/02/post-403.php I guess Japanese should stop discriminating students by when they entered into the school if they wish to make students repeat their years?] (\u7559\u5e74\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306a\u3089\u5148\u8f29\u5f8c\u8f29\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3082\u6b62\u3081\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3067\u306f\uff1f) News Week Japan, \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\u767a\u3000\u65e5\u672c\uff0f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab \u65b0\u6642\u4ee3.

Although the Japanese consider themselves to be a homogeneous people, minorities do exist, and they often suffer discrimination. The title of the chief executive in Japan is the Japan Executive Branch. The largest indigenous minority are the two to four million ''[[Burakumin|hisabetsu buraku]]'' (\"discriminated communities\"), descendants of the outcast communities of feudal Japan. Other such minorities include the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], the [[indigenous people|indigenous inhabitants]] of northern Japan, and the people of [[Okinawa]]. Japan also has several hundred thousand native residents of [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[China|Chinese]] descent who together with other [[Gaikokujin|foreign residents]] experience varying forms and degrees of discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=Think you've got rights as a foreigner in Japan?

However, reports by Japanese bar associations, human rights groups, and some prisoners indicated such physical abuse, which they often do not report, takes place in regard to the treatment of illegal immigrants. Also, [[Amnesty International]] reports that the use of physical force in the penal system is not uncommon. National Police Law permits persons to lodge complaints against the police with national and local public safety commissions. These commissions may direct the police to conduct investigations.\n\n=== Confessions ===\nThe Constitution and the [[Criminal Code of Japan|Criminal Code]] include safeguards to ensure that no criminal suspect can be compelled to make a self-incriminating conviction.<!-- in recent years on the grounds that they were obtained as a result of coerced confessions.--> In addition, civil and criminal suits alleging abuse during [[interrogation]] and detention have been brought against some police and prosecution officials. In 2003, the use of leather restraining body belts was abolished.  Softer leather handcuffs without body belts were instituted as substitute restraining devices.

Prisons operated at an average 117% capacity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/16/AR2006041600852_2.html|title=Errant Elders Find Amenities in Japan's Jails|last=Faiola|first=Anthony |date=April 17, 2006|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> In some institutions, two inmates were placed in cells designed for one inmate, and thirty or sixty in cells meant for 15.\n\nAccording to prison officials at [[Fuchu]] and [[Yokohama]] prisons, medical attention was inadequate. The MOJ's Corrections Bureau likewise acknowledged that correctional facilities lacked medical preparedness. The Government's Project Team on Medical Issues of Correctional Institutions continued to consult with related organizations on such issues as increasing medical staff, upgrading medical conditions during nights and weekends, and strengthening cooperative relationships with medical institutions in the community. In May, the Minister formed a subcommittee to improve prison medical facilities.\n\nIn some institutions clothing and blankets were insufficient to protect inmates against cold weather. Most prisons did not provide heating during nighttime hours in winter despite freezing temperatures, subjecting inmates to a range of preventable cold injuries. Foreign prisoners in the Tokyo area continued to present to visiting diplomats during the year  fingers and toes affected by [[chillblain]]s of varying severity, the direct result of long-term exposure to cold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eap/204206.htm|title=Japan|website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]], the authorities are permitted to read letters sent or received by prisoners and they are not required to disclose this practice to prisoners. If the content is deemed \"inappropriate\", the letter may be [[Censorship|censor]]ed or confiscated. All visits with convicted prisoners were monitored; however, prisoners whose cases were pending were allowed private access to their legal representatives.\n\nThe MOJ is not required to inform a condemned inmate's family prior to the person's execution. Human rights organizations reported that lawyers also were not told of an execution until after the fact and that death row prisoners were held for years in solitary confinement with little contact with anyone but prison guards. Parole may not be granted for any reason, including medical and humanitarian reasons, until an inmate has served two thirds of his or her sentence.\n\nThe JFBA and human rights groups have criticized the prison system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to numerous rules. Prison rules remained confidential. While the [[Prison Law Enforcement Regulation]] stipulates that the maximum time prisoners may be held in single cells is 6 months, activists claim that wardens continued to have broad leeway in enforcing punishments selectively, including \"minor solitary confinement\", which may be imposed for a minimum of 1 and not more than 60 days. Claims have also been made that prisoners were sometimes forced to kneel motionless in an empty cell for several hours at a time; however, foreigners and the handicapped were allowed to sit on a hard stool, at the discretion of the prison warden.\n\nIn December,{{when|date=March 2019}} the [[House of Councillors|Upper House]] passed both a [[Crime-Victims law]] and a revision to the 1908 [[Prison Law]]. The Crime-Victims law calls for compensation and counseling for crime victims, upholding victims' rights, and providing victims with criminal investigation information. Aimed at toughening penalties against felons, the Penal Code revision establishes new charges for gang rape, increases maximum prison terms and penalties for life-threatening crimes, and extends the statute of limitations for prosecuting capital offenses from 15 to 29 years.\n\nIn February 2003, the government ratified the [[Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons]], allowing foreign prisoners to petition to serve their sentences in their home country. The government added the stipulation that prisoners must serve at least one third of their sentence in Japan before petitions will be considered. As of June 2007, 10 American prisoners have been transferred to the [[United States]] to complete their sentences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-transfer.html|title=Prisoner Transfer|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225134138/http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-transfer.html|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWomen and juveniles were housed separately from men; however, male prison guards sometimes guarded female prisoners. During the year, a male prison warden was charged with \"violence and cruelty by a special public officer\" for engaging in sexual acts with a female inmate awaiting trial. During the year, some women's detention facilities were operating over stated capacity. Pretrial detainees were held separately from convicted prisoners.\n\nWhile the government limited access by human rights groups to detention facilities, prison visits were allowed. However, [[Amnesty International]] claimed that human rights groups were not allowed access to Nagoya prison because of ongoing court cases related to alleged abuses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/403f57b98.html|title=Refworld {{!}} U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2003 - Japan|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=Refworld|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention ===\nThe Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. The law provides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. Persons may not be detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the law, a suspect may be held in detention at either a regular detention facility or \"substitute\" (police) detention facility for up to 72 hours. A judge must interview suspects prior to detention. A judge may extend preindictment custody by up to two consecutive 10-day periods based on a prosecutor's application. These extensions were sought and granted routinely. Under extraordinary circumstances, prosecutors may seek an additional 5-day extension, bringing the maximum period of preindictment custody to 28 days.\n\nThe [[National Police Safety Commission]] oversees the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] (NPA). In addition, each prefecture has a prefectural police safety commission as well as a prefectural police agency, which was primarily funded by the prefecture's budget. Corruption and impunity were not problems within either the national or the prefectural police forces.\n\nUnder the [[Criminal Procedure Code]], police and prosecutors have the power to control or limit access by legal counsel when deemed necessary for the sake of an investigation. Counsel may not be present during interrogations at any time before or after indictment. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indictment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney before indictment, although local bar associations provided detainees with limited free counseling. Critics charged that access to counsel was limited both in duration and frequency; however, the Government denied that this was the case. Incommunicado detention could be used for up to 23 days.\n\nCritics charged that allowing suspects to be detained by the same authorities who interrogated them heightened the potential for abuse and coercion. The Government countered that cases of persons sent to police detention facilities tended to be those in which the facts were not in dispute. An MOJ regulation permits officials to limit the amount of documentation related to ongoing court cases retained by prisoners.\n\nThe [[Law for Expediting Court Procedure]] became effective in 2003. The average trial period in 2005 was 3.2 months for criminal cases<ref name=\"HR2006\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78775.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006|date=March 6, 2007|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> and 8.2 months for civil cases. The length of time before a suspect was brought to trial depended on the nature of the crime, but rarely exceeded 3 months from the date of arrest; the average was 1 to 2 months.\n\n=== Trials ===\n{{See also|Judicial system of Japan}}\nThe Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the Government has generally respected this provision in practice. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can be renewed until judges reach the age of 65. Justices of the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] can serve until the age of 70, but face periodic review through popular referendums.\n\nThere are several levels of court, including high courts, district courts, family courts, and summary courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the final court of appeal. Normally a trial begins at the district court level, and a verdict may be appealed to a higher court, and ultimately, to the Supreme Court. The government generally respected in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to a [[speedy trial|speedy]] and [[public trial]] by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. Although most criminal trials were completed within a reasonable length of time, cases occasionally took several years to work their way through the trial and appeals process.\n\nIn July 2003, the Diet passed legislation aimed at reducing the average time required to complete criminal trials and civil trials that include witness examination. Its provisions include hiring substantial numbers of additional court and MOJ personnel, revising bar examinations, establishing new graduate law schools to increase the overall number of legal professionals threefold by 2010, and requiring that courts and opposing litigants jointly work to improve trial planning by allowing for earlier evidence collection and disclosure. The advisory panel on judicial reform released the official standards for setting up graduate law schools, and in March 2004, 68 universities (22 public and 46 private) opened new law schools.<ref name=\"HR2004\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41644.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2004|date=February 28, 2005|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe July 2003, law also makes the Supreme Court responsible for accelerating proceedings in lower courts, imposes a 2-year time limit for courts to bring criminal and civil trials to conclusion, and requires the government to take the legal and financial measures necessary to accomplish these goals. A defendant is informed of the charges upon arrest and is assured a public trial by an independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right of cross-examination. There was no trial by jury; however, a judicial reform bill passed in May will allow serious criminal cases to be tried by a six-person, randomly selected jury and panel of judges. The law was scheduled to take effect in 2009.\n\nThe defendant is presumed innocent. The Constitution provides defendants with the right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as well as to free and private access to counsel; however, the Government contended that the right to consult with attorneys is not absolute and can be restricted if such restriction is compatible with the spirit of the Constitution. Access sometimes was abridged in practice; for example, the law allows prosecutors to control access to counsel before indictment, and there were allegations of coerced confessions. Defendants are protected from the retroactive application of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a formal indictment. However, the law does not require full disclosure by prosecutors, and material that the prosecution does not use in court may be suppressed. Critics claimed that legal representatives of defendants did not always have access to all needed relevant material in the police record. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first instance may appeal to a higher court.\n\nNo guidelines mandate the acceptable quality of communications between judges, lawyers, and non-Japanese speaking defendants, and no standard licensing or qualification system for certifying court interpreters exists. A trial may proceed even if the accused does not understand what is happening or being said.

In 2002, the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Defense Agency]] confirmed reports that it had violated a law protecting personal information when it compiled lists of citizens seeking official documents. A privacy bill to prevent such actions passed the Diet on May 2, 2003.\n*The government's attitude regarding international and nongovernmental investigation of alleged violations of human rights is generally cooperative and responsive to human rights groups' views, although the government restricts their access to detention facilities. A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without governmental restrictions, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials generally were cooperative and responsive to their views, although the Government restricted access by human rights groups to detention facilities.\n*In December 2008 [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] gave a recommendation to Japan relating to public welfare in Article 12 and 13 of the Constitution that \"while taking note of the State party's explanation that 'public welfare' cannot be relied on as a ground on placing arbitrary restrictions on human rights, the Committee reiterate its concern that the concept of 'public welfare' is vague and open-ended and may permit restrictions excceding those permissible under the Covenant (art. 2).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/401/08/PDF/G0940108.pdf?OpenElement|title=Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 40 of the Covenant, CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, (para 10 p.3) 18 December 2008|publisher=|access-date=December 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413123227/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/401/08/PDF/G0940108.pdf?OpenElement|archive-date=April 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Civil liberties ==\n\n=== Freedom of speech and of the press ===\n{{see also|Censorship in Japan}}\nThe [[Constitution of Japan#Individual rights (Articles 10\u201340)|Japanese Constitution]] provides for freedom of speech and of the press. In theory, an independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. However, Japan's system of exclusive [[Kisha club|press clubs]] has been criticised by press freedom groups. The clubs often provide major media outlets with exclusive access to news sources, while generally barring foreign and freelance reporters. The clubs provide the establishment press with access to official press conferences and background briefings with politicians, lawyers and business leaders. Critics say the club system allows the authorities to [[Censorship|suppress]] news that they consider unfavorable to them and that it lowers the quality of news coverage.\n\nFree speech and press issues include:\n*In July 2003, the Diet passed legislation prohibiting the solicitation of sex from minors through the Internet. The Japan Internet Providers Association and the Telecom Services Association expressed concerns about the definitions of child prohibited sites and about the actions providers are required to take to prevent illegal use of Internet sites.\n*In 2015 journalists and political experts report that the government of Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] is engineering a fundamental shift in the balance of power between his administration and the news media, using tactics to silence criticism that go beyond anything his predecessors tried.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/world/asia/in-japan-bid-to-stifle-media-is-working.html?src=me&_r=0 \"Effort by Japan to Stifle News Media Is Working\"], Martin Fackler, ''New York Times'', April 26, 2015.

While deprogramming cases decreased during the year, a Unification Church spokesman reported that prosecutors dropped two cases due to insufficient evidence. Although one member reportedly was kidnapped by her family during the year, the Unification Church did not report the case to police. Concerns remained regarding the tendency of officials to judge [[deprogramming]] as a family matter. Unlike in previous years, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] reported that their religious rights were respected by the Government during the year.{{when|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Freedom of movement ===\nThe [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] provides for the freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, immigration, and repatriation, and the [[Government of Japan|Government]] generally respects them in practice. Citizens have the right to travel freely both within the country and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. [[Citizenship]] may be forfeited by naturalization in a foreign country or by failure of persons born with dual nationality to elect citizenship at the required age. The law does not permit forced [[exile]], and it is not used.<ref name=\"HR2006\" />\n\nThe law provides for the granting of [[refugee]] status or asylum to persons in accordance with the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] or its 1967 Protocol. In practice, the government provided protection against refoulement, the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution, but did not routinely grant refugee or asylum status. The Government cooperated with the office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.\n\nIn May 2003, the Diet passed a bill abolishing the 60-day application deadline previously required for aliens seeking refugee status. The previous refugee recognition law stipulated that those seeking refugee status had to apply within 60 days upon arriving in Japan or within 60 days of learning that they were likely to be persecuted in their home country. An alien recognized as a refugee has access to educational facilities, public relief and aid, and social welfare benefits.<ref name=\"HR2003\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27772.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2003|date=February 25, 2004|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\nGovernment records indicated that 523,617 persons were detained in 2003 at immigration detention centers.

The Government considered that most persons seeking asylum in the country did so for economic reasons. In 2003, there were approximately 7,900 refugees and asylum seekers in the country, of whom an estimated 7,700 were [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Cambodia]]n refugees. Out of 336 refugee claims submitted in 2003, the Government granted asylum to 10 persons from [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Burundi]], and [[Iran]] and issued long-term residence permits based on humanitarian considerations to 16. As part of its ongoing family-reunification program for close relatives of Indochinese refugees resettled in earlier years, the Government admitted 147 refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia in 2003.<ref name=\"HR2004\" />\n\nIn May 2003, a law was passed granting the [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Justice Minister]] authority to issue temporary stay permits to persons seeking asylum.<ref name=\"HR2003\" /> While this law provides a way for [[asylum seeker]]s to have legal status in the country during the refugee recognition process, in practice it was quite difficult to obtain such permits. In January 2003, the [[Immigration Bureau]] began to give detailed, written explanations of decisions not to grant refugee status to asylum-seekers and opened an information office at [[Narita International Airport|Narita Airport]] for potential asylum seekers.\n\n== Political rights ==\nThe Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair [[Elections in Japan|elections]] held on the basis of [[universal suffrage]]. The country is a [[parliamentary democracy]] governed by the political party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]. The [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] and the [[New Komeito Party]] formed the existing coalition government. Except for a brief hiatus in the 1990s, the LDP has been the dominant party in every government since the mid-1950s. The last general elections were held in on September 11, 2005, and elections for the [[House of Councillors|Upper House]] were held in July 2003.\n\nAccording to [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] figures for January through June 2003, there were 43 arrests involving political corruption for such charges as bribery, bid-rigging, and violation of the [[Political Funds Control Law]]. This was an increase of 14 cases from the previous year for the same time period.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> In recent years, the numbers of women holding public office has slowly increased. As of July 2003, women held 34 of 480 seats in the Lower House of the Diet and 33 seats in the 242-seat Upper House. As of September 2003, there were two women in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]]. As of April 2003, 4 of the country's 47 governors were women.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan had not ratified the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[1926 Slavery Convention]] or the [[United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]].\n\n== Discrimination ==\nThe [[Japanese constitution#Individual rights|Constitution]] prohibits [[discrimination]] of citizens on the basis of race, creed, [[gender]], social status, or family origin; non-citizens are not protected from these forms of discrimination by the constitution nor the law as of 2014.\n\n== Violence against women ==\nViolence against women, particularly [[domestic violence]], often goes unreported due to social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's spouse or children. NPA statistics on violence against women probably understated the magnitude of the problem. According to NPA statistics, there were 12,568 cases of alleged domestic violence and 1,499 restraining orders issued in 2003. Police took action in 41 cases in which court orders were violated. Between April and September, the 120 preferential consultation centers received 24,818 cases of domestic violence consultations. Of the total 103,986 consultations since fiscal 2002, 99.6% were for women.<ref name=\"HR2004\" />\n\nThe law allows district courts to impose 6-month restraining orders on perpetrators of domestic violence and to sentence violators up to 1 year in prison or impose fines of up to 1 million yen. According to [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] figures from January through September 2003, 1,579 applications for restraining orders against abusive spouses were sought, and 1,256 were issued.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> The orders either banned perpetrators from approaching their victims or ordered them to move away from the home, or both. The law also covers common-law marriages and divorced individuals; it also encourages prefectures to expand shelter facilities for domestic abuse victims and stipulates that local governments offer financial assistance to 40 private institutions already operating such shelters.\n\nThe revision to the Law for the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims passed in May expanded the definition of spousal violence to include mental, sexual, and physical abuse and increased the length of restraining orders from 2 weeks to 2 months.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of article 750 of the Civil Code in December 2015. That article requires a husband and wife to adopt the same surname.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/japan#|title=Human Rights Watch|last=Avenue|first=Human Rights Watch {{!}} 350 Fifth|last2=York|first2=34th Floor {{!}} New|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=December 11, 2018|last3=t 1.212.290.4700|first3=NY 10118-3299 USA {{!}}|date=January 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Rape ==\nNPA statistics reported 2,472 rapes in 2003.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> Husbands have been prosecuted for spousal rape; usually these cases involved a third party who assisted in the rape. In light of several high-profile gang rapes in 2003 involving college students at Waseda University, the Upper House passed a bill in December making gang rape an offense punishable by a minimum penalty of 4 years in prison. In November 2004, a former student was sentenced to 14 years in prison for raping two women at a party organized by the \"[[Super Free]]\" student group, as well as a third woman in December 2001. All 13 other defendants received jail sentences of up to 10 years. Many local governments responded to the need for confidential assistance for abused women by establishing special women's consultation departments in police and prefectural offices.<ref name=CNN2018-04-22a/> However,  as of 2018, women were still deterred from reporting rape and sexual assault by legal and practical obstacles, by the treatment of women who speak out, such as [[Shiori It\u014d]], and by many other  difficulties.<ref name=CNN2018-04-22a>{{cite news |title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html|author1=Anna Stewart|author2=Euan McKirdy |author3=Junko Ogura|author4=Yoko Ishitani |date=April 22, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018 |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=BBC2018-06-28a>{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n== Groping ==\nLocal governments and private rail operators continued to implement measures designed to address the widespread problem of groping and molestation of female commuters. Several railway companies have introduced women-only rail cars on various trains, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly revised its anti-groping ordinance to make first-time offenders subject to imprisonment.\n\n== Sexual harassment and gender discrimination at workplace ==\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Law in Japan does not prohibit [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.\n\nThe Constitution and the [[Equal Employment]] Opportunity (EEO) Law aims to prohibit sexual discrimination; however, sexual harassment in the workplace remains widespread. The National Personnel Authority has established workplace rules in an effort to stop harassment in public servants' workplaces. A 1999 revision to the EEO Law includes measures to identify companies that fail to prevent sexual harassment, but it does not include punitive measures to enforce compliance, other than allowing names of offending companies to be publicized. A number of government entities have established hotlines and designated ombudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination and [[sexual harassment]].\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has not ratified the International Labour Organization's [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]] nor [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention]].\n\nWomen made up 40.5% of the labor force, and women between the ages of 15 and 64 had a labor force participation rate of 48.5%. Although the Labor Standards and the EEO laws prohibit wage discrimination, in 2003, the average hourly wage for women was only 67.8% of the hourly wage for men. There was a significant salary income gap between men and women in 2003, with 64% of female employees earning 3 million yen or less per year, as compared with 18% of all male employees, according to Cabinet Office statistics. Much of this disparity resulted from the \"two-track\" personnel administration system found in most larger companies under which new hires were put either in the managerial track (for those perceived as having executive potential) or the general track (for those engaged in basic office work).\n\nUp to June 2015, Japan has not signed nor ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]].\n\nAdvocacy groups for women and persons with disabilities continued to press for a government investigation, a formal government apology, and compensation for [[compulsory sterilization]]s that were carried out between 1949 and 1992.\n\n== Comfort women ==\n{{see also|Comfort women}}\n\nSeveral cases filed by women forced to work as \"[[comfort women]]\" (women and girls forced into sexual slavery) during World War II were finalized during 2004. In February,{{When|date=September 2011}} the Tokyo High Court rejected an appeal by 7 Taiwanese former \"comfort women\", while in November the Supreme Court dismissed a damage suit filed in 1991 by 35 Korean wartime \"comfort women\".

[[Education in Japan|Education]] is mostly free and [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] through the lower secondary level (age 14 or [[ninth grade]]). Education was available widely to students who met minimum academic standards at the upper secondary level through the age of 18. Society places an extremely high value on education, and enrollment levels for both boys and girls through the free upper secondary level exceeded 96%.\n\nChildren under the age of 14 cannot be held criminally responsible for their actions. Under juvenile [[law]], juvenile suspects are tried in family court and have the right of appeal to an appellate court. [[Family court]] proceedings are not open to the public, a policy that has been criticized by family members of juvenile crime victims. For the last several years, juvenile crime has shown a trend toward more serious offenses such as [[murder]], [[robbery]], [[arson]], and [[rape]]. The [[Tokyo]] prefectural government continued programs to protect the welfare of stateless children, whose births their [[illegal immigrant]] mothers had refused to register for fear of forcible [[repatriation]].\n\n=== Child abuse and neglect ===\n\nPublic attention has focused increasingly on reports of frequent [[child abuse]] in the home.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milaniak|first=Izabela|date=2014|title=Does child abuse and neglect increase risk for perpetration of violence inside and outside the home?|journal= Psychology of Violence|volume= 5|issue=3|pages= 246\u2013255|pmc=4504697|pmid=26191459|doi=10.1037/a0037956}}</ref> The law grants [[child welfare]] officials the authority to prohibit abusive parents from meeting or communicating with their children, although due to Japanese cultural views on family matters being \"private\", this enforcement option is rarely exercised. The law also bans abuse under the guise of [[discipline]] and obliges teachers, doctors, and welfare officials to report any suspicious circumstances to 1 of the 182 nationwide local child counseling centers or to a municipal welfare center. In May 2003, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare reported that 108 children died as a result of child abuse since the enactment of the Child Abuse Prevention Law in 2000.\n\nIn 2003, there were a record 23,738 cases of child abuse, up almost 2% from 2002, according to the Cabinet Office. Approximately 50% of the cases involved [[violence]], and 40% were cases of parental [[neglect]]. Child welfare centers likewise reported a record 26,573 calls in 2003, an increase of 2,800 calls from the previous year. Generally accepted statistics indicate that upwards of 70% of child abuse cases involve a female perpetrator, usually the child's [[mother]]. Although the Government offered subsidies to local governments to combat record-high child abuse, only 13% accepted the offer. Most of the local governments declining the subsidies stated they could not afford to pay their share of the bill.\n\nin 2014  the police reported 13,037 cases of child abuse including sexual abuse and death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/09/13/lifestyle/kodomo-ie-home-away-home/|title=Kodomo no Ie: home away from home|first=Masami|last=Ito|date=September 13, 2014|publisher=|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/25/national/crime-legal/police-handled-record-13037-cases-of-child-abuse-in-first-half-of-year/|title=Police handled record 13,037 cases of child abuse in first half of year|date=September 25, 2014|publisher=|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/article-expired/|title=Article expired|date=May 10, 2013|website=The Japan Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Danielle Demetriou |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/08/child-abuse-soars-record-high-japan-amid-fury-10-year-old-girls/ |title=Child abuse soars to record high in Japan amid fury at 10-year-old girl's death at home |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/08/national/u-n-panel-calls-japan-address-high-level-violence-sexual-abuse-exploitation-children-chiba-case/ |title=U.N. rights panel calls on Japan to address high levels of violence against children |work=The Japan Times |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== School bullying ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIncidents of violence in schools, severe [[bullying]] (\"ijime\") and [[bullycide]] also continued to be a societal and government concern. According to the [[MEXT|Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry]], public [[elementary school]] children committed a record 1,777 violent acts in the 2003 academic year, an increase of 27% from the previous school year, including acts of violence committed both on and off school grounds. In all 35,392 violent acts were committed in public elementary, [[junior high]], and [[high school]]s during the 2003 academic year. Overall, cases of bullying rose 5.2%.\n\nStudent-on-student violence accounted for 50% of the violence by students in public schools. In June, a [[sixth grade]]r murdered her classmate, and a junior high school student pushed a 5-year-old boy off the fourth floor of an apartment building. The MOJ's Office of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights provided counseling services for children 18 years of age and younger who had been victims of bullying. In May,{{When|date=May 2019}} a High Court overturned a 2002 lower court ruling and ordered seven persons to pay a total 57.6 million yen to parents of a 13-year-old boy killed in a bullying incident in 1993.\n\n=== Sexual exploitation/abuse ===\n\nTeenage prostitution, dating for money, and [[child pornography]] continue to be problems. According to the Cabinet Office's white paper, there were 722 sex-related crimes associated with dating sites during the year. Easy access to websites through mobile phones with Internet access made it easier for strangers to set up encounters with juveniles. In July 2003, the Diet passed a law criminalizing the use of the Internet for [[child pornography]] and [[child prostitution|prostitution]].\n\n== Trafficking of persons ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Constitution prohibits holding persons in bondage, and the government employed a variety of labor and immigration statutes to carry out limited trafficking-related prosecutions; however, there are no specific laws that prohibit [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]]. In April, the government created a senior coordinator presiding over an inter-ministerial committee for anti-trafficking efforts. In December, the Government released its Action Plan to combat trafficking in persons. Focusing on prevention, prosecution, and protection of trafficking victims, the Action Plan calls for a review of \"entertainer\" visas, strengthened immigration control, revision of the penal code to make trafficking in persons a crime, and added protection of victims through shelters, counseling, and repatriation assistance.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has ratified the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]].\n\n=== Sexual exploitation ===\n[[woman trafficking|Trafficking of women and girls]] into the country has been a problem <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=A. |title=Human Trafficking, the Japanese Commercial Sex Industry, and the Yakuza: Recommendations for the Japanese Government |journal=Affairs Review |date=2010 |volume=49}}</ref>. Women and girls, primarily from Thailand, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe, were trafficked into the country for [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labour]]. Women and girls from Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, Malaysia, Burma, and Indonesia also were trafficked into the country in smaller numbers. The country was a destination for illegal immigrants from China who were trafficked by organized crime groups and held in debt bondage for sexual exploitation and indentured servitude in sweatshops and restaurants. The Government reported that some smugglers used killings and abduction to enforce cooperation.\n\nAlthough reliable statistics on the number of women trafficked to the country were unavailable, human rights groups reported that up to 200,000 persons, mostly Southeast Asian women, are smuggled annually into the country and forced to work in the sex industry. In 2003, the NPA arrested 41 individuals for trafficking-related offenses, 8 of whom were traffickers. Of these individuals, 36 were convicted, 14 received prison terms, 17 received fines, and 5 received both a fine and prison term. In February 2003, 17 prefecture police offices and the Tokyo Metropolitan police simultaneously raided 24 strip clubs and rescued 68 trafficking victims.<ref>{{cite news|title=White Paper on Police, 2004|publisher=[[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency of Japan]]|page=121}}</ref> The NPA also participated in 16 transnational investigations. During the year, efforts were underway to improve screening of travelers arriving in Japan from key source countries of trafficking and to tighten the issuance of \"entertainer\" visas, which are often used by traffickers.\n\nThe government does not consider an individual who has willingly entered into an agreement to work illegally in the country to be a trafficking victim, regardless of that person's working conditions. Thus, government figures may understate the problem, as persons who agreed to one kind of work found themselves doing another, or were subject to force, fraud, or coercion.\n\nTraffickers were prosecuted for crimes ranging from violations of employment law to immigration violations. A government-funded study released in 2000 found that nearly two-thirds of foreign women surveyed following arrests for immigration offenses reported that they were working in the sex industry under duress. Many women who were trafficked into the country, particularly from the Philippines, entered legally on entertainment visas. \"Entertainers\" are not covered by the Labor Standards Law and have no minimum wage protections. Brokers in the countries of origin recruited women and \"sold\" them to intermediaries, who in turn subjected them to debt bondage and coercion. Agents, brokers, and employers involved in trafficking for sexual exploitation often had ties to organized crime.\n\nWomen trafficked to the country generally were employed as prostitutes under coercive conditions in businesses licensed to provide commercial sex services. Sex entertainment businesses are classified as \"store form\" businesses such as strip clubs, sex shops, hostess bars, and private video rooms, and as \"nonstore form\" businesses such as escort services and mail order video services, which arrange for sexual services to be conducted elsewhere. According to NGOs and other credible sources, most women who were trafficked to the country for the purpose of sexual exploitation were employed as hostesses in \"snack\" bars, where they were required to provide sexual services off-premises.\n\nTrafficking victims generally did not realize the extent of their indebtedness, the amount of time it would take them to repay the debts, or the conditions of employment they would be subjected to upon arrival. According to Human Rights Watch, the passports of women trafficked to work in \"dating\" bars usually were confiscated by their employers, who also demanded repayment for the cost of the woman's \"purchase\". Typically, the women were charged 3 to 5 million yen, their living expenses, medical care (when provided by the employer) and other necessities, as well as \"fines\" for misbehavior added to the original \"debt\" over time. How the debt was calculated was left to the employers; the process was not transparent, and the employers reportedly often used the debt to coerce additional unpaid labor from the trafficked women. Employers also sometimes \"resold\", or threatened to resell, troublesome women or women found to be HIV positive, thereby increasing their debt and possibly worsening their working conditions.\n\nMany women trafficked into the sex trade had their movements strictly controlled by their employers and were threatened with reprisals, perhaps through members of organized crime groups, to themselves or their families if they tried to escape. Employers often isolated the women, subjected them to constant surveillance, and used violence to punish them for disobedience. There were reports that some brokers used drugs to subjugate victims. Many trafficked women also knew that they were subject to arrest if found without their passports or other identification documents. Few spoke Japanese well, making escape even more difficult.\n\nDomestic NGOs and lawyers also compiled credible anecdotal evidence suggesting the possibility that some individual police officials returned trafficking victims to their employers when these individuals sought police protection. NGOs also reported that police sometimes declined to investigate suspected brokers when presented with information obtained from trafficking victims.\n\nExcept for the Tokyo Metropolitan and [[Kanagawa]] Prefectural Government, which funded locally based NGOs assisting victims of trafficking, the Government did not assist victims of trafficking other than to house them temporarily in detention centers for illegal immigrants or facilities established under the Antiprostitution Law, or by referral to shelters run by NGOs. Generally these trafficking victims were deported as illegal aliens. During the year, the Government administratively decided not to treat victims as immediately deportable criminals, allowing the Government to develop its cases against traffickers. Activists claim that victims without documentation or sufficient funds to return to their country of origin were sometimes detained for long periods. Several NGOs throughout the country provided shelter, medical aid, and legal assistance to trafficking victims.\n\nDuring the year, government officials met with destination-country officials and participated in a Southeast Asian study tour to research trafficking issues. The Government has instituted tighter entertainer visa issuance and intends to cut the number of such visas issued to women from the Philippines from 80,000 to 8,000 a year. In 2003, the Cabinet Affairs Office conducted a campaign to heighten public awareness of violence against women and trafficking, while the NPA produced a training video on trafficking and distributed it to all police offices to improve their awareness of trafficking. In 2003, the Government disbursed 315 million yen to [[UNICEF]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and the Philippine government to alleviate poverty, raise awareness of the dangers of trafficking, and promote alternative economic opportunities for women.\n\n== Rights of persons with disabilities ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n{{main|Disability rights in Japan}}\nThere were an estimated 3.4 million persons over the age of 18 with [[physical disabilities]] and roughly 3 million with [[mental disabilities]]. Although not generally subject to overt discrimination in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services, persons with disabilities faced limited access to public transportation, \"mainstream\" public education, and other facilities. The Deliberation Panel on the Employment of the [[Handicapped]], which operates within the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], has mandated that private companies with 300 or more employees hire a fixed minimum proportion of persons with disabilities. The penalty for noncompliance is a fine.\n\nThe law does not mandate accessibility to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, the law on construction standards for public facilities allows operators of hospitals, theaters, hotels, and similar enterprises to receive low-interest loans and tax benefits if they build wider entrances and elevators to accommodate persons with disabilities.\n\n[[The Law to Promote the Employment of the Handicapped]] includes those with mental disabilities. The law also loosened the licensing requirements for community support centers that promote employment for persons with disabilities, and it introduced government subsidies for the employment of persons with mental disabilities in part-time jobs. In 2003, workers with disabilities employed by private companies comprised on average 1.5% of the total number of regular employees, somewhat less than the legally stipulated rate of 1.8%. While nearly 70% of large corporations (1,000 or more employees) fell short of this goal, several large corporations had special divisions for workers with disabilities, including [[Omron]], [[Sony]], and [[Honda]]. For example, 80% of Omron's Kyoto factory staff of 82 had disabilities, with the majority having severe disabilities. These employees earn an average of 3 million yen per year, which is above the minimum wage.\n\nAt the end of 2002, all prefectural governments and 91.5% of local city governments had developed basic plans for citizens with disabilities. In June, the [[Disabled Persons Fundamental Law]] was revised, obligating all municipalities to draw up formal plans for the disabled.\n\nAs of June 2015, Japan has ratified the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] but not signed nor ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html|title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Minorities ==\n{{See also|Ethnic issues in Japan|Burakumin}}\n{{Main|Americans in Japan|Bangladeshis in Japan|Filipinos in Japan|Iranians in Japan|Indonesians in Japan|Vietnamese people in Japan|Mongolians in Japan|Russians in Japan|Turks in Japan|History of the Jews in Japan}}\n\n[[Burakumin]], [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]], [[Chinese in Japan|Chinese]], and [[Gaikokujin|alien workers]] experienced varying degrees of societal discrimination, some of it severe and longstanding. The approximately 3 million Burakumin (descendants of feudal era \"outcasts\"), although not subject to governmental discrimination, frequently were victims of entrenched societal discrimination, including restricted access to housing and employment opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blhrri.org/blhrri_e/blhrri/buraku.htm|title=What is Buraku Discrimination ?|publisher=Buraku Liberation and Human Rights Research Institute|accessdate=October 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920122257/http://blhrri.org/blhrri_e/blhrri/buraku.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|MOJ]], there were nearly 1.85 million legal foreign residents as of 2002. The largest group, at approximately 625,400, was ethnic Koreans, followed by [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Brazil]]ians, and [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipinos]]. Despite improvements in legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean permanent residents (so-called [[Zainichi Korean]]s, most of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan) were subject to various forms of deeply entrenched societal discrimination. Harassment and threats against pro-[[North Korea]]n organizations and persons reportedly have increased since the 2002 admission by North Korea that it had [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|kidnapped more than a dozen Japanese citizens]]. Other foreigners also were subject to discrimination. There was a widespread perception among Japanese citizens that foreigners committed many [[Crime in Japan|crimes]]. According to a government survey, more than 70% of citizens worried that an increase in the number of illegally employed foreign workers could undermine public safety and result in human rights abuses against the workers themselves. Nevertheless, more than 80% said the country should accept foreign laborers conditionally or unconditionally.<ref>{{cite news|title=70% of Japanese worried about illegal foreign labor: poll+|date=July 24, 2004|publisher=Kyodo World News Service}}</ref>\n\nA controversial [[Japan Immigration Bureau|Immigration Bureau]] website launched in February allows informants to report the name, address, or workplace of any suspicious foreigners for such reasons as \"causing a nuisance in the neighborhood\" and \"causing anxiety\". In the face of protests from human rights groups, the site was amended in March to remove the preset reasons, but remained operational at year's end.\n\nBy law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for naturalization and citizenship rights, including the [[right to vote]]; however, in practice, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, partly due to fears that their cultural identity would be lost.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Obstacles to naturalization included broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and great emphasis on [[Japanese language]] ability. Naturalization procedures also required an extensive background check, including inquiries into the applicant's economic status and assimilation into society. Koreans were given the option of adopting a Japanese surname. The Government defended its naturalization procedures as necessary to ensure the smooth assimilation of foreigners into society. Alien permanent residents may live abroad for up to 4 or 5 years without losing their right to permanent residence in the country.\n\nIn September 2003, the [[School Education Law]] was amended to allow graduates of 21 non-Japanese language schools to become automatically eligible to take university entrance examinations. Previously all students of non-Japanese language schools were required to pass a state-run high school equivalency test to qualify for the examinations. The amended law also enabled universities to set their admissions criteria at their own discretion. During 2003, many national universities also admitted graduates of non-Japanese language schools other than the 21 schools included in the School Education Law amendment.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has not ratified the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-calls-member-states-ratify-convention-against-discrimination-education|title=UNESCO calls Member States to ratify the Convention against Discrimination in Education|date=2019-04-19|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Indigenous people: Ryukyuan and Ainu people ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe [[Ainu people]] are people descended from the first inhabitants of the country. Under an 1899 law, the Government pursued a policy of forced assimilation, imposing mandatory Japanese-language education and denying the Ainu their right to continue traditional practices. The law also left the Ainu with control of approximately 0.15% of their original land holdings and empowered the Government to manage communal assets.\n\nAfter a 1997 court ruling, the Diet passed a law that recognized the Ainu as an [[ethnic minority]], required all prefectural governments to develop basic programs for promoting Ainu culture and traditions, canceled previous laws that discriminated against the Ainu, and required the Government of Hokkaid\u014d to return Ainu communal assets. However, the law stopped short of recognizing the Ainu as the indigenous people of Hokkaid\u014d, failed to address whether they deserved special rights as a distinct ethnic group, and did not mandate civil rights protection for the Ainu. A nonbinding accompanying resolution referred to the Ainu as a legal minority.\n\nThe [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] to the [[United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] stated that the Ainu never had entered into a consensual juridical relationship with any state and noted that the lack of such an agreement deprived them of their rights. Many Ainu criticized the Law to Promote Ainu Culture for not advancing Ainu political rights and criticized the Government for not providing funds for noncultural activities that would improve Ainu living conditions or financial status. The Japan Ainu Association, a nationwide organization of Ainu, lobbied the Government for economic assistance and greater social welfare benefits. Although [[Ainu language]] newspapers, radio programs, and academic programs studying Ainu culture have increased, the Ainu continued to face societal discrimination.\n\n== Worker rights ==\n\n=== Right of association ===\nThe Constitution provides for the right of workers to associate freely in [[Labor unions in Japan|unions]]. In 2003, approximately 10.5 million workers, 19.6% of all employees, belonged to labor unions. Unions were free of government control and influence. The [[Sohyo|Japanese Trade Union Confederation]], which represented 6.8 million workers and was formed in 1989 through the merger of several confederations, was the largest labor organization.\n\nSome public employees, including members of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], [[police]], and [[firefighter]]s are not permitted to form unions or to strike. These restrictions have led to a long-running dispute with the ILO Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations over the observance of ILO Convention 98 concerning the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Committee has observed that these public employees have a limited capacity to participate in the process of determining their wages and has asked the Government to consider measures it could take to encourage negotiations with public employees. The Government determines the pay of government employees based on a recommendation by the independent [[National Personnel Authority]].\n\n=== Sexual harassment law in the workplace===\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Law of Japan created in 1972 only advises or recommends employers to take measures to prevent sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is the most reported category labor cases at the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] in Japan.\n\nIn 1999 the Equal Employment Opportunity Act was revised and a provision was added that required employers to take measures to prevent sexual harassment against women in the workplace.  It was revised again in 2007 to include male victims, and it was revised again in 2014 to include same-sex sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/03/25/issues/japan-sees-progress-sexual-harassment-still-dont-get/|title=Japan sees progress on sexual harassment, but some still don't get it|date=March 25, 2015|website=The Japan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Right to organize and bargain collectively ===\nThe Constitution provides unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights were exercised freely, and collective bargaining was practiced widely. The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers exercised this right in practice. There are no export processing zones.\n\n=== Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor ===\nThe Constitution provides that no person shall be held in bondage of any kind. Involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime, is prohibited. Although children were not specified in the provision, this legal prohibition against forced or compulsory labor applies equally to adults and to children. In practice, there were no reports of persons held in bondage or involuntary servitude apart from trafficking victims.\n\nFormer Allied prisoners of war and Chinese and Korean workers continued to press claims in Japanese civil courts and in complaints to the ILO for damages and compensation for forced labor during World War II. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court rejected appeals from former prisoners of war and others who claimed they were forced to work for private Japanese companies as slave laborers during World War II.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> In July, overturning a district court's 2002 decision against Chinese plaintiffs, a high court ordered [[Nishimatsu]] Construction Company to pay 27.5 million yen in compensation to a group of World War II slave laborers. In January 2003, a U.S. federal appeals court dismissed a number of lawsuits by former prisoners of war and civilians who alleged they had been forced to labor for private Japanese firms during World War II.\n\nJapan has ratified the [[ILO Convention]] on [[Forced Labour Convention|Forced Labour No. 29]] in 1932, yet as of June 2015 still has not ratified [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|Abolition of Forced Labour Convention No. 105]].\n\n=== Prohibition of child labor ===\nThe Constitution bans the employment of children. Both societal values and the rigorous enforcement of the Labor Standards Law protect children from exploitation in the workplace. By law, children under the age of 15 may not be employed, and those under age 18 may not be employed in dangerous or harmful jobs.\n\n=== Acceptable work conditions and minimum wage ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n[[Minimum wage]]s are set on a regional (prefectural) and industry basis, with the input of tripartite (workers, employers, public interest) advisory councils. Employers covered by a minimum wage must post the concerned minimum wages, and compliance with minimum wages was considered widespread. Minimum wage rates ranged according to prefecture from 606 to 710 yen per hour. Minimum wage rates were considered sufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent [[standard of living]].\n\nThe Labor Standards Law provides for a 40-hour work week for most industries and mandates premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, or 8 in a day. However, labor unions frequently criticized the government for failing to enforce maximum [[working hours]] regulations in smaller firms. Activist groups claimed that employers exploited or discriminated against foreign workers, who often had little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal rights.\n\nThe government tried to reduce the inflow of illegal foreign workers by prosecuting employers of such workers. According to NPA figures, 175 persons were charged with \"illegal employment assistance\" during the first half of 2002. The [[Immigration Law]] provides for penalties against employers of undocumented foreign workers. Maximum fines for illegal employment assistance were raised to 3 million yen in December. Suspected foreign workers also may be denied entry for passport, visa, and entry application irregularities. The Government continued to study the foreign worker issue, and several citizens' groups were working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to information on worker rights.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Labor]] effectively administered various laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law. Standards were set by the Ministry of Labor and issued after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Central Labor Standards Council. Labor inspectors have the authority to suspend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice concerns over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working conditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n* [[Ainu people]]\n* [[Demographics of Japan]]\n* [[Ethnic issues in Japan]]\n* [[Flag of Japan]]\n* [[Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Japan|Freedom of Information Rights in Japan]]\n* [[Homelessness in Japan]]\n* [[Homosexuality in Japan]]\n* [[Human trafficking in Japan]]\n* [[International child abduction in Japan]]\n* [[LGBT rights in Japan]]\n* [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens]]\n* [[Prostitution in Japan]]\n* [[Raelyn Campbell]]\n* [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan People]]\n* [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Independence Movement]]\n* [[Women in Japan]]\n\n'''International:'''\n* [[Human rights in Central Asia]]\n* [[Human rights in Europe]]\n* [[Human rights in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''This article incorporates text from the [[US State Department]]'s 2003-2007 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]].''\n* {{loc}}\n* [http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/ Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs page on Human Rights in Japan]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.crnjapan.net/ The Japan Children's Rights Network]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100531195353/http://www.jiwe.or.jp/english/law/law1_1_1.html Equal Employment Opportunity Law]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061002152305/http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/151/ Censorship in Japan]\n* [http://newsletters.ahrchk.net/jpn/ AHRC articles, including urgent appeals, statements and open letters into Japanese.

This results in socially recognized abuse and bullying of younger people and children by elders in schools, institutes, and at home.

Although the Japanese consider themselves to be a homogeneous people, minorities do exist, and they often suffer discrimination. The title of the chief executive in Japan is the Japan Executive Branch. The largest indigenous minority are the two to four million ''[[Burakumin|hisabetsu buraku]]'' (\"discriminated communities\"), descendants of the outcast communities of feudal Japan. Other such minorities include the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], the [[indigenous people|indigenous inhabitants]] of northern Japan, and the people of [[Okinawa]].

However, reports by Japanese bar associations, human rights groups, and some prisoners indicated such physical abuse, which they often do not report, takes place in regard to the treatment of illegal immigrants. Also, [[Amnesty International]] reports that the use of physical force in the penal system is not uncommon. National Police Law permits persons to lodge complaints against the police with national and local public safety commissions. These commissions may direct the police to conduct investigations.\n\n=== Confessions ===\nThe Constitution and the [[Criminal Code of Japan|Criminal Code]] include safeguards to ensure that no criminal suspect can be compelled to make a self-incriminating conviction.<!-- in recent years on the grounds that they were obtained as a result of coerced confessions.--> In addition, civil and criminal suits alleging abuse during [[interrogation]] and detention have been brought against some police and prosecution officials.

Regarding the other suspicious deaths, the Ministry said that approximately 10 deaths could be attributed to poor medical care. The authorities reported they had lost the documentation on nine deaths in Tokyo's [[Fuch\u016b Prison]].

Prisons operated at an average 117% capacity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/16/AR2006041600852_2.html|title=Errant Elders Find Amenities in Japan's Jails|last=Faiola|first=Anthony |date=April 17, 2006|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> In some institutions, two inmates were placed in cells designed for one inmate, and thirty or sixty in cells meant for 15.\n\nAccording to prison officials at [[Fuchu]] and [[Yokohama]] prisons, medical attention was inadequate. The MOJ's Corrections Bureau likewise acknowledged that correctional facilities lacked medical preparedness. The Government's Project Team on Medical Issues of Correctional Institutions continued to consult with related organizations on such issues as increasing medical staff, upgrading medical conditions during nights and weekends, and strengthening cooperative relationships with medical institutions in the community. In May, the Minister formed a subcommittee to improve prison medical facilities.\n\nIn some institutions clothing and blankets were insufficient to protect inmates against cold weather. Most prisons did not provide heating during nighttime hours in winter despite freezing temperatures, subjecting inmates to a range of preventable cold injuries. Foreign prisoners in the Tokyo area continued to present to visiting diplomats during the year  fingers and toes affected by [[chillblain]]s of varying severity, the direct result of long-term exposure to cold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eap/204206.htm|title=Japan|website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]], the authorities are permitted to read letters sent or received by prisoners and they are not required to disclose this practice to prisoners. If the content is deemed \"inappropriate\", the letter may be [[Censorship|censor]]ed or confiscated. All visits with convicted prisoners were monitored; however, prisoners whose cases were pending were allowed private access to their legal representatives.\n\nThe MOJ is not required to inform a condemned inmate's family prior to the person's execution. Human rights organizations reported that lawyers also were not told of an execution until after the fact and that death row prisoners were held for years in solitary confinement with little contact with anyone but prison guards. Parole may not be granted for any reason, including medical and humanitarian reasons, until an inmate has served two thirds of his or her sentence.\n\nThe JFBA and human rights groups have criticized the prison system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to numerous rules. Prison rules remained confidential. While the [[Prison Law Enforcement Regulation]] stipulates that the maximum time prisoners may be held in single cells is 6 months, activists claim that wardens continued to have broad leeway in enforcing punishments selectively, including \"minor solitary confinement\", which may be imposed for a minimum of 1 and not more than 60 days. Claims have also been made that prisoners were sometimes forced to kneel motionless in an empty cell for several hours at a time; however, foreigners and the handicapped were allowed to sit on a hard stool, at the discretion of the prison warden.\n\nIn December,{{when|date=March 2019}} the [[House of Councillors|Upper House]] passed both a [[Crime-Victims law]] and a revision to the 1908 [[Prison Law]]. The Crime-Victims law calls for compensation and counseling for crime victims, upholding victims' rights, and providing victims with criminal investigation information. Aimed at toughening penalties against felons, the Penal Code revision establishes new charges for gang rape, increases maximum prison terms and penalties for life-threatening crimes, and extends the statute of limitations for prosecuting capital offenses from 15 to 29 years.\n\nIn February 2003, the government ratified the [[Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons]], allowing foreign prisoners to petition to serve their sentences in their home country. The government added the stipulation that prisoners must serve at least one third of their sentence in Japan before petitions will be considered. As of June 2007, 10 American prisoners have been transferred to the [[United States]] to complete their sentences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-transfer.html|title=Prisoner Transfer|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225134138/http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-transfer.html|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWomen and juveniles were housed separately from men; however, male prison guards sometimes guarded female prisoners. During the year, a male prison warden was charged with \"violence and cruelty by a special public officer\" for engaging in sexual acts with a female inmate awaiting trial. During the year, some women's detention facilities were operating over stated capacity. Pretrial detainees were held separately from convicted prisoners.\n\nWhile the government limited access by human rights groups to detention facilities, prison visits were allowed. However, [[Amnesty International]] claimed that human rights groups were not allowed access to Nagoya prison because of ongoing court cases related to alleged abuses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/403f57b98.html|title=Refworld {{!}} U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2003 - Japan|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=Refworld|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention ===\nThe Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. The law provides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. Persons may not be detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the law, a suspect may be held in detention at either a regular detention facility or \"substitute\" (police) detention facility for up to 72 hours. A judge must interview suspects prior to detention. A judge may extend preindictment custody by up to two consecutive 10-day periods based on a prosecutor's application. These extensions were sought and granted routinely. Under extraordinary circumstances, prosecutors may seek an additional 5-day extension, bringing the maximum period of preindictment custody to 28 days.\n\nThe [[National Police Safety Commission]] oversees the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] (NPA). In addition, each prefecture has a prefectural police safety commission as well as a prefectural police agency, which was primarily funded by the prefecture's budget. Corruption and impunity were not problems within either the national or the prefectural police forces.\n\nUnder the [[Criminal Procedure Code]], police and prosecutors have the power to control or limit access by legal counsel when deemed necessary for the sake of an investigation. Counsel may not be present during interrogations at any time before or after indictment. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indictment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney before indictment, although local bar associations provided detainees with limited free counseling. Critics charged that access to counsel was limited both in duration and frequency; however, the Government denied that this was the case. Incommunicado detention could be used for up to 23 days.\n\nCritics charged that allowing suspects to be detained by the same authorities who interrogated them heightened the potential for abuse and coercion. The Government countered that cases of persons sent to police detention facilities tended to be those in which the facts were not in dispute. An MOJ regulation permits officials to limit the amount of documentation related to ongoing court cases retained by prisoners.\n\nThe [[Law for Expediting Court Procedure]] became effective in 2003. The average trial period in 2005 was 3.2 months for criminal cases<ref name=\"HR2006\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78775.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006|date=March 6, 2007|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> and 8.2 months for civil cases. The length of time before a suspect was brought to trial depended on the nature of the crime, but rarely exceeded 3 months from the date of arrest; the average was 1 to 2 months.\n\n=== Trials ===\n{{See also|Judicial system of Japan}}\nThe Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the Government has generally respected this provision in practice. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can be renewed until judges reach the age of 65. Justices of the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] can serve until the age of 70, but face periodic review through popular referendums.\n\nThere are several levels of court, including high courts, district courts, family courts, and summary courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the final court of appeal. Normally a trial begins at the district court level, and a verdict may be appealed to a higher court, and ultimately, to the Supreme Court. The government generally respected in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to a [[speedy trial|speedy]] and [[public trial]] by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. Although most criminal trials were completed within a reasonable length of time, cases occasionally took several years to work their way through the trial and appeals process.\n\nIn July 2003, the Diet passed legislation aimed at reducing the average time required to complete criminal trials and civil trials that include witness examination. Its provisions include hiring substantial numbers of additional court and MOJ personnel, revising bar examinations, establishing new graduate law schools to increase the overall number of legal professionals threefold by 2010, and requiring that courts and opposing litigants jointly work to improve trial planning by allowing for earlier evidence collection and disclosure. The advisory panel on judicial reform released the official standards for setting up graduate law schools, and in March 2004, 68 universities (22 public and 46 private) opened new law schools.<ref name=\"HR2004\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41644.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2004|date=February 28, 2005|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe July 2003, law also makes the Supreme Court responsible for accelerating proceedings in lower courts, imposes a 2-year time limit for courts to bring criminal and civil trials to conclusion, and requires the government to take the legal and financial measures necessary to accomplish these goals. A defendant is informed of the charges upon arrest and is assured a public trial by an independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right of cross-examination. There was no trial by jury; however, a judicial reform bill passed in May will allow serious criminal cases to be tried by a six-person, randomly selected jury and panel of judges. The law was scheduled to take effect in 2009.\n\nThe defendant is presumed innocent. The Constitution provides defendants with the right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as well as to free and private access to counsel; however, the Government contended that the right to consult with attorneys is not absolute and can be restricted if such restriction is compatible with the spirit of the Constitution. Access sometimes was abridged in practice; for example, the law allows prosecutors to control access to counsel before indictment, and there were allegations of coerced confessions. Defendants are protected from the retroactive application of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a formal indictment. However, the law does not require full disclosure by prosecutors, and material that the prosecution does not use in court may be suppressed. Critics claimed that legal representatives of defendants did not always have access to all needed relevant material in the police record. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first instance may appeal to a higher court.\n\nNo guidelines mandate the acceptable quality of communications between judges, lawyers, and non-Japanese speaking defendants, and no standard licensing or qualification system for certifying court interpreters exists. A trial may proceed even if the accused does not understand what is happening or being said. Foreign detainees frequently claimed that police urged them to sign statements in Japanese that they could not read and were not translated adequately.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has not signed nor ratified the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].\n\nThere were no reports of political prisoners.\n\n===Other issues===\n*The Constitution does not prohibit arbitrary interference with [[privacy]], family, home, or correspondence but prohibit them by [[case law]] on interpretation on Article 13 of the Constitution, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In April 2003, the Public Security Investigation Agency extended surveillance of the terrorist group Aleph (formerly known as [[Aum Shinrikyo]]) because the government declared the group still posed a danger to society. In 2002, the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Defense Agency]] confirmed reports that it had violated a law protecting personal information when it compiled lists of citizens seeking official documents. A privacy bill to prevent such actions passed the Diet on May 2, 2003.\n*The government's attitude regarding international and nongovernmental investigation of alleged violations of human rights is generally cooperative and responsive to human rights groups' views, although the government restricts their access to detention facilities. A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without governmental restrictions, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials generally were cooperative and responsive to their views, although the Government restricted access by human rights groups to detention facilities.\n*In December 2008 [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] gave a recommendation to Japan relating to public welfare in Article 12 and 13 of the Constitution that \"while taking note of the State party's explanation that 'public welfare' cannot be relied on as a ground on placing arbitrary restrictions on human rights, the Committee reiterate its concern that the concept of 'public welfare' is vague and open-ended and may permit restrictions excceding those permissible under the Covenant (art. 2).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/401/08/PDF/G0940108.pdf?OpenElement|title=Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 40 of the Covenant, CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, (para 10 p.3) 18 December 2008|publisher=|access-date=December 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413123227/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/401/08/PDF/G0940108.pdf?OpenElement|archive-date=April 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Civil liberties ==\n\n=== Freedom of speech and of the press ===\n{{see also|Censorship in Japan}}\nThe [[Constitution of Japan#Individual rights (Articles 10\u201340)|Japanese Constitution]] provides for freedom of speech and of the press. In theory, an independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. However, Japan's system of exclusive [[Kisha club|press clubs]] has been criticised by press freedom groups. The clubs often provide major media outlets with exclusive access to news sources, while generally barring foreign and freelance reporters. The clubs provide the establishment press with access to official press conferences and background briefings with politicians, lawyers and business leaders. Critics say the club system allows the authorities to [[Censorship|suppress]] news that they consider unfavorable to them and that it lowers the quality of news coverage.\n\nFree speech and press issues include:\n*In July 2003, the Diet passed legislation prohibiting the solicitation of sex from minors through the Internet.

While deprogramming cases decreased during the year, a Unification Church spokesman reported that prosecutors dropped two cases due to insufficient evidence. Although one member reportedly was kidnapped by her family during the year, the Unification Church did not report the case to police. Concerns remained regarding the tendency of officials to judge [[deprogramming]] as a family matter. Unlike in previous years, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] reported that their religious rights were respected by the Government during the year.{{when|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Freedom of movement ===\nThe [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] provides for the freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, immigration, and repatriation, and the [[Government of Japan|Government]] generally respects them in practice. Citizens have the right to travel freely both within the country and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. [[Citizenship]] may be forfeited by naturalization in a foreign country or by failure of persons born with dual nationality to elect citizenship at the required age. The law does not permit forced [[exile]], and it is not used.<ref name=\"HR2006\" />\n\nThe law provides for the granting of [[refugee]] status or asylum to persons in accordance with the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] or its 1967 Protocol. In practice, the government provided protection against refoulement, the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution, but did not routinely grant refugee or asylum status. The Government cooperated with the office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.\n\nIn May 2003, the Diet passed a bill abolishing the 60-day application deadline previously required for aliens seeking refugee status. The previous refugee recognition law stipulated that those seeking refugee status had to apply within 60 days upon arriving in Japan or within 60 days of learning that they were likely to be persecuted in their home country. An alien recognized as a refugee has access to educational facilities, public relief and aid, and social welfare benefits.<ref name=\"HR2003\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27772.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2003|date=February 25, 2004|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\nGovernment records indicated that 523,617 persons were detained in 2003 at immigration detention centers.

The Government considered that most persons seeking asylum in the country did so for economic reasons. In 2003, there were approximately 7,900 refugees and asylum seekers in the country, of whom an estimated 7,700 were [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Cambodia]]n refugees. Out of 336 refugee claims submitted in 2003, the Government granted asylum to 10 persons from [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Burundi]], and [[Iran]] and issued long-term residence permits based on humanitarian considerations to 16. As part of its ongoing family-reunification program for close relatives of Indochinese refugees resettled in earlier years, the Government admitted 147 refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia in 2003.<ref name=\"HR2004\" />\n\nIn May 2003, a law was passed granting the [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Justice Minister]] authority to issue temporary stay permits to persons seeking asylum.<ref name=\"HR2003\" /> While this law provides a way for [[asylum seeker]]s to have legal status in the country during the refugee recognition process, in practice it was quite difficult to obtain such permits. In January 2003, the [[Immigration Bureau]] began to give detailed, written explanations of decisions not to grant refugee status to asylum-seekers and opened an information office at [[Narita International Airport|Narita Airport]] for potential asylum seekers.\n\n== Political rights ==\nThe Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair [[Elections in Japan|elections]] held on the basis of [[universal suffrage]]. The country is a [[parliamentary democracy]] governed by the political party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]. The [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] and the [[New Komeito Party]] formed the existing coalition government. Except for a brief hiatus in the 1990s, the LDP has been the dominant party in every government since the mid-1950s. The last general elections were held in on September 11, 2005, and elections for the [[House of Councillors|Upper House]] were held in July 2003.\n\nAccording to [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] figures for January through June 2003, there were 43 arrests involving political corruption for such charges as bribery, bid-rigging, and violation of the [[Political Funds Control Law]]. This was an increase of 14 cases from the previous year for the same time period.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> In recent years, the numbers of women holding public office has slowly increased. As of July 2003, women held 34 of 480 seats in the Lower House of the Diet and 33 seats in the 242-seat Upper House. As of September 2003, there were two women in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]]. As of April 2003, 4 of the country's 47 governors were women.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan had not ratified the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[1926 Slavery Convention]] or the [[United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]].\n\n== Discrimination ==\nThe [[Japanese constitution#Individual rights|Constitution]] prohibits [[discrimination]] of citizens on the basis of race, creed, [[gender]], social status, or family origin; non-citizens are not protected from these forms of discrimination by the constitution nor the law as of 2014.\n\n== Violence against women ==\nViolence against women, particularly [[domestic violence]], often goes unreported due to social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's spouse or children. NPA statistics on violence against women probably understated the magnitude of the problem. According to NPA statistics, there were 12,568 cases of alleged domestic violence and 1,499 restraining orders issued in 2003. Police took action in 41 cases in which court orders were violated. Between April and September, the 120 preferential consultation centers received 24,818 cases of domestic violence consultations. Of the total 103,986 consultations since fiscal 2002, 99.6% were for women.<ref name=\"HR2004\" />\n\nThe law allows district courts to impose 6-month restraining orders on perpetrators of domestic violence and to sentence violators up to 1 year in prison or impose fines of up to 1 million yen. According to [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] figures from January through September 2003, 1,579 applications for restraining orders against abusive spouses were sought, and 1,256 were issued.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> The orders either banned perpetrators from approaching their victims or ordered them to move away from the home, or both. The law also covers common-law marriages and divorced individuals; it also encourages prefectures to expand shelter facilities for domestic abuse victims and stipulates that local governments offer financial assistance to 40 private institutions already operating such shelters.\n\nThe revision to the Law for the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims passed in May expanded the definition of spousal violence to include mental, sexual, and physical abuse and increased the length of restraining orders from 2 weeks to 2 months.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of article 750 of the Civil Code in December 2015. That article requires a husband and wife to adopt the same surname.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/japan#|title=Human Rights Watch|last=Avenue|first=Human Rights Watch {{!}} 350 Fifth|last2=York|first2=34th Floor {{!}} New|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=December 11, 2018|last3=t 1.212.290.4700|first3=NY 10118-3299 USA {{!}}|date=January 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Rape ==\nNPA statistics reported 2,472 rapes in 2003.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> Husbands have been prosecuted for spousal rape; usually these cases involved a third party who assisted in the rape. In light of several high-profile gang rapes in 2003 involving college students at Waseda University, the Upper House passed a bill in December making gang rape an offense punishable by a minimum penalty of 4 years in prison. In November 2004, a former student was sentenced to 14 years in prison for raping two women at a party organized by the \"[[Super Free]]\" student group, as well as a third woman in December 2001. All 13 other defendants received jail sentences of up to 10 years. Many local governments responded to the need for confidential assistance for abused women by establishing special women's consultation departments in police and prefectural offices.<ref name=CNN2018-04-22a/> However,  as of 2018, women were still deterred from reporting rape and sexual assault by legal and practical obstacles, by the treatment of women who speak out, such as [[Shiori It\u014d]], and by many other  difficulties.<ref name=CNN2018-04-22a>{{cite news |title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html|author1=Anna Stewart|author2=Euan McKirdy |author3=Junko Ogura|author4=Yoko Ishitani |date=April 22, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018 |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=BBC2018-06-28a>{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n== Groping ==\nLocal governments and private rail operators continued to implement measures designed to address the widespread problem of groping and molestation of female commuters. Several railway companies have introduced women-only rail cars on various trains, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly revised its anti-groping ordinance to make first-time offenders subject to imprisonment.\n\n== Sexual harassment and gender discrimination at workplace ==\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Law in Japan does not prohibit [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.\n\nThe Constitution and the [[Equal Employment]] Opportunity (EEO) Law aims to prohibit sexual discrimination; however, sexual harassment in the workplace remains widespread. The National Personnel Authority has established workplace rules in an effort to stop harassment in public servants' workplaces. A 1999 revision to the EEO Law includes measures to identify companies that fail to prevent sexual harassment, but it does not include punitive measures to enforce compliance, other than allowing names of offending companies to be publicized. A number of government entities have established hotlines and designated ombudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination and [[sexual harassment]].\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has not ratified the International Labour Organization's [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]] nor [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention]].\n\nWomen made up 40.5% of the labor force, and women between the ages of 15 and 64 had a labor force participation rate of 48.5%. Although the Labor Standards and the EEO laws prohibit wage discrimination, in 2003, the average hourly wage for women was only 67.8% of the hourly wage for men. There was a significant salary income gap between men and women in 2003, with 64% of female employees earning 3 million yen or less per year, as compared with 18% of all male employees, according to Cabinet Office statistics. Much of this disparity resulted from the \"two-track\" personnel administration system found in most larger companies under which new hires were put either in the managerial track (for those perceived as having executive potential) or the general track (for those engaged in basic office work).\n\nUp to June 2015, Japan has not signed nor ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]].\n\nAdvocacy groups for women and persons with disabilities continued to press for a government investigation, a formal government apology, and compensation for [[compulsory sterilization]]s that were carried out between 1949 and 1992.\n\n== Comfort women ==\n{{see also|Comfort women}}\n\nSeveral cases filed by women forced to work as \"[[comfort women]]\" (women and girls forced into sexual slavery) during World War II were finalized during 2004. In February,{{When|date=September 2011}} the Tokyo High Court rejected an appeal by 7 Taiwanese former \"comfort women\", while in November the Supreme Court dismissed a damage suit filed in 1991 by 35 Korean wartime \"comfort women\". In December 2004 the Tokyo High Court dismissed an appeal by 4 Chinese former \"comfort women\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington University|first=Memory and Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific|title=Comfort Women: Japan|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~memory/data/judicial/comfortwomen_japan/Chinese%20(1st%20group).html|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> and the Supreme Court rejected a suit filed in 1993 by 46 Filipina wartime \"comfort women\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~memory/data/judicial/comfortwomen_japan/filipina.html|title=Filipino Comfort Women|website=www2.gwu.edu}}</ref>\n\n== Rights of children ==\nBoys and girls have equal access to [[health care]] and other public services. [[Education in Japan|Education]] is mostly free and [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] through the lower secondary level (age 14 or [[ninth grade]]). Education was available widely to students who met minimum academic standards at the upper secondary level through the age of 18. Society places an extremely high value on education, and enrollment levels for both boys and girls through the free upper secondary level exceeded 96%.\n\nChildren under the age of 14 cannot be held criminally responsible for their actions. Under juvenile [[law]], juvenile suspects are tried in family court and have the right of appeal to an appellate court. [[Family court]] proceedings are not open to the public, a policy that has been criticized by family members of juvenile crime victims. For the last several years, juvenile crime has shown a trend toward more serious offenses such as [[murder]], [[robbery]], [[arson]], and [[rape]]. The [[Tokyo]] prefectural government continued programs to protect the welfare of stateless children, whose births their [[illegal immigrant]] mothers had refused to register for fear of forcible [[repatriation]].\n\n=== Child abuse and neglect ===\n\nPublic attention has focused increasingly on reports of frequent [[child abuse]] in the home.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milaniak|first=Izabela|date=2014|title=Does child abuse and neglect increase risk for perpetration of violence inside and outside the home?|journal= Psychology of Violence|volume= 5|issue=3|pages= 246\u2013255|pmc=4504697|pmid=26191459|doi=10.1037/a0037956}}</ref> The law grants [[child welfare]] officials the authority to prohibit abusive parents from meeting or communicating with their children, although due to Japanese cultural views on family matters being \"private\", this enforcement option is rarely exercised. The law also bans abuse under the guise of [[discipline]] and obliges teachers, doctors, and welfare officials to report any suspicious circumstances to 1 of the 182 nationwide local child counseling centers or to a municipal welfare center. In May 2003, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare reported that 108 children died as a result of child abuse since the enactment of the Child Abuse Prevention Law in 2000.\n\nIn 2003, there were a record 23,738 cases of child abuse, up almost 2% from 2002, according to the Cabinet Office. Approximately 50% of the cases involved [[violence]], and 40% were cases of parental [[neglect]]. Child welfare centers likewise reported a record 26,573 calls in 2003, an increase of 2,800 calls from the previous year. Generally accepted statistics indicate that upwards of 70% of child abuse cases involve a female perpetrator, usually the child's [[mother]]. Although the Government offered subsidies to local governments to combat record-high child abuse, only 13% accepted the offer. Most of the local governments declining the subsidies stated they could not afford to pay their share of the bill.\n\nin 2014  the police reported 13,037 cases of child abuse including sexual abuse and death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/09/13/lifestyle/kodomo-ie-home-away-home/|title=Kodomo no Ie: home away from home|first=Masami|last=Ito|date=September 13, 2014|publisher=|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/25/national/crime-legal/police-handled-record-13037-cases-of-child-abuse-in-first-half-of-year/|title=Police handled record 13,037 cases of child abuse in first half of year|date=September 25, 2014|publisher=|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/article-expired/|title=Article expired|date=May 10, 2013|website=The Japan Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Danielle Demetriou |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/08/child-abuse-soars-record-high-japan-amid-fury-10-year-old-girls/ |title=Child abuse soars to record high in Japan amid fury at 10-year-old girl's death at home |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/08/national/u-n-panel-calls-japan-address-high-level-violence-sexual-abuse-exploitation-children-chiba-case/ |title=U.N. rights panel calls on Japan to address high levels of violence against children |work=The Japan Times |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== School bullying ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIncidents of violence in schools, severe [[bullying]] (\"ijime\") and [[bullycide]] also continued to be a societal and government concern. According to the [[MEXT|Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry]], public [[elementary school]] children committed a record 1,777 violent acts in the 2003 academic year, an increase of 27% from the previous school year, including acts of violence committed both on and off school grounds. In all 35,392 violent acts were committed in public elementary, [[junior high]], and [[high school]]s during the 2003 academic year. Overall, cases of bullying rose 5.2%.\n\nStudent-on-student violence accounted for 50% of the violence by students in public schools. In June, a [[sixth grade]]r murdered her classmate, and a junior high school student pushed a 5-year-old boy off the fourth floor of an apartment building. The MOJ's Office of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights provided counseling services for children 18 years of age and younger who had been victims of bullying. In May,{{When|date=May 2019}} a High Court overturned a 2002 lower court ruling and ordered seven persons to pay a total 57.6 million yen to parents of a 13-year-old boy killed in a bullying incident in 1993.\n\n=== Sexual exploitation/abuse ===\n\nTeenage prostitution, dating for money, and [[child pornography]] continue to be problems. According to the Cabinet Office's white paper, there were 722 sex-related crimes associated with dating sites during the year. Easy access to websites through mobile phones with Internet access made it easier for strangers to set up encounters with juveniles. In July 2003, the Diet passed a law criminalizing the use of the Internet for [[child pornography]] and [[child prostitution|prostitution]].\n\n== Trafficking of persons ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Constitution prohibits holding persons in bondage, and the government employed a variety of labor and immigration statutes to carry out limited trafficking-related prosecutions; however, there are no specific laws that prohibit [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]]. In April, the government created a senior coordinator presiding over an inter-ministerial committee for anti-trafficking efforts. In December, the Government released its Action Plan to combat trafficking in persons. Focusing on prevention, prosecution, and protection of trafficking victims, the Action Plan calls for a review of \"entertainer\" visas, strengthened immigration control, revision of the penal code to make trafficking in persons a crime, and added protection of victims through shelters, counseling, and repatriation assistance.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has ratified the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]].\n\n=== Sexual exploitation ===\n[[woman trafficking|Trafficking of women and girls]] into the country has been a problem <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=A. |title=Human Trafficking, the Japanese Commercial Sex Industry, and the Yakuza: Recommendations for the Japanese Government |journal=Affairs Review |date=2010 |volume=49}}</ref>. Women and girls, primarily from Thailand, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe, were trafficked into the country for [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labour]]. Women and girls from Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, Malaysia, Burma, and Indonesia also were trafficked into the country in smaller numbers. The country was a destination for illegal immigrants from China who were trafficked by organized crime groups and held in debt bondage for sexual exploitation and indentured servitude in sweatshops and restaurants. The Government reported that some smugglers used killings and abduction to enforce cooperation.\n\nAlthough reliable statistics on the number of women trafficked to the country were unavailable, human rights groups reported that up to 200,000 persons, mostly Southeast Asian women, are smuggled annually into the country and forced to work in the sex industry. In 2003, the NPA arrested 41 individuals for trafficking-related offenses, 8 of whom were traffickers. Of these individuals, 36 were convicted, 14 received prison terms, 17 received fines, and 5 received both a fine and prison term. In February 2003, 17 prefecture police offices and the Tokyo Metropolitan police simultaneously raided 24 strip clubs and rescued 68 trafficking victims.<ref>{{cite news|title=White Paper on Police, 2004|publisher=[[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency of Japan]]|page=121}}</ref> The NPA also participated in 16 transnational investigations. During the year, efforts were underway to improve screening of travelers arriving in Japan from key source countries of trafficking and to tighten the issuance of \"entertainer\" visas, which are often used by traffickers.\n\nThe government does not consider an individual who has willingly entered into an agreement to work illegally in the country to be a trafficking victim, regardless of that person's working conditions. Thus, government figures may understate the problem, as persons who agreed to one kind of work found themselves doing another, or were subject to force, fraud, or coercion.\n\nTraffickers were prosecuted for crimes ranging from violations of employment law to immigration violations. A government-funded study released in 2000 found that nearly two-thirds of foreign women surveyed following arrests for immigration offenses reported that they were working in the sex industry under duress. Many women who were trafficked into the country, particularly from the Philippines, entered legally on entertainment visas. \"Entertainers\" are not covered by the Labor Standards Law and have no minimum wage protections. Brokers in the countries of origin recruited women and \"sold\" them to intermediaries, who in turn subjected them to debt bondage and coercion. Agents, brokers, and employers involved in trafficking for sexual exploitation often had ties to organized crime.\n\nWomen trafficked to the country generally were employed as prostitutes under coercive conditions in businesses licensed to provide commercial sex services. Sex entertainment businesses are classified as \"store form\" businesses such as strip clubs, sex shops, hostess bars, and private video rooms, and as \"nonstore form\" businesses such as escort services and mail order video services, which arrange for sexual services to be conducted elsewhere. According to NGOs and other credible sources, most women who were trafficked to the country for the purpose of sexual exploitation were employed as hostesses in \"snack\" bars, where they were required to provide sexual services off-premises.\n\nTrafficking victims generally did not realize the extent of their indebtedness, the amount of time it would take them to repay the debts, or the conditions of employment they would be subjected to upon arrival. According to Human Rights Watch, the passports of women trafficked to work in \"dating\" bars usually were confiscated by their employers, who also demanded repayment for the cost of the woman's \"purchase\". Typically, the women were charged 3 to 5 million yen, their living expenses, medical care (when provided by the employer) and other necessities, as well as \"fines\" for misbehavior added to the original \"debt\" over time. How the debt was calculated was left to the employers; the process was not transparent, and the employers reportedly often used the debt to coerce additional unpaid labor from the trafficked women. Employers also sometimes \"resold\", or threatened to resell, troublesome women or women found to be HIV positive, thereby increasing their debt and possibly worsening their working conditions.\n\nMany women trafficked into the sex trade had their movements strictly controlled by their employers and were threatened with reprisals, perhaps through members of organized crime groups, to themselves or their families if they tried to escape. Employers often isolated the women, subjected them to constant surveillance, and used violence to punish them for disobedience. There were reports that some brokers used drugs to subjugate victims. Many trafficked women also knew that they were subject to arrest if found without their passports or other identification documents. Few spoke Japanese well, making escape even more difficult.\n\nDomestic NGOs and lawyers also compiled credible anecdotal evidence suggesting the possibility that some individual police officials returned trafficking victims to their employers when these individuals sought police protection. NGOs also reported that police sometimes declined to investigate suspected brokers when presented with information obtained from trafficking victims.\n\nExcept for the Tokyo Metropolitan and [[Kanagawa]] Prefectural Government, which funded locally based NGOs assisting victims of trafficking, the Government did not assist victims of trafficking other than to house them temporarily in detention centers for illegal immigrants or facilities established under the Antiprostitution Law, or by referral to shelters run by NGOs. Generally these trafficking victims were deported as illegal aliens. During the year, the Government administratively decided not to treat victims as immediately deportable criminals, allowing the Government to develop its cases against traffickers. Activists claim that victims without documentation or sufficient funds to return to their country of origin were sometimes detained for long periods. Several NGOs throughout the country provided shelter, medical aid, and legal assistance to trafficking victims.\n\nDuring the year, government officials met with destination-country officials and participated in a Southeast Asian study tour to research trafficking issues. The Government has instituted tighter entertainer visa issuance and intends to cut the number of such visas issued to women from the Philippines from 80,000 to 8,000 a year. In 2003, the Cabinet Affairs Office conducted a campaign to heighten public awareness of violence against women and trafficking, while the NPA produced a training video on trafficking and distributed it to all police offices to improve their awareness of trafficking. In 2003, the Government disbursed 315 million yen to [[UNICEF]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and the Philippine government to alleviate poverty, raise awareness of the dangers of trafficking, and promote alternative economic opportunities for women.\n\n== Rights of persons with disabilities ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n{{main|Disability rights in Japan}}\nThere were an estimated 3.4 million persons over the age of 18 with [[physical disabilities]] and roughly 3 million with [[mental disabilities]]. Although not generally subject to overt discrimination in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services, persons with disabilities faced limited access to public transportation, \"mainstream\" public education, and other facilities. The Deliberation Panel on the Employment of the [[Handicapped]], which operates within the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], has mandated that private companies with 300 or more employees hire a fixed minimum proportion of persons with disabilities. The penalty for noncompliance is a fine.\n\nThe law does not mandate accessibility to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, the law on construction standards for public facilities allows operators of hospitals, theaters, hotels, and similar enterprises to receive low-interest loans and tax benefits if they build wider entrances and elevators to accommodate persons with disabilities.\n\n[[The Law to Promote the Employment of the Handicapped]] includes those with mental disabilities. The law also loosened the licensing requirements for community support centers that promote employment for persons with disabilities, and it introduced government subsidies for the employment of persons with mental disabilities in part-time jobs. In 2003, workers with disabilities employed by private companies comprised on average 1.5% of the total number of regular employees, somewhat less than the legally stipulated rate of 1.8%. While nearly 70% of large corporations (1,000 or more employees) fell short of this goal, several large corporations had special divisions for workers with disabilities, including [[Omron]], [[Sony]], and [[Honda]]. For example, 80% of Omron's Kyoto factory staff of 82 had disabilities, with the majority having severe disabilities. These employees earn an average of 3 million yen per year, which is above the minimum wage.\n\nAt the end of 2002, all prefectural governments and 91.5% of local city governments had developed basic plans for citizens with disabilities. In June, the [[Disabled Persons Fundamental Law]] was revised, obligating all municipalities to draw up formal plans for the disabled.\n\nAs of June 2015, Japan has ratified the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] but not signed nor ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html|title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Minorities ==\n{{See also|Ethnic issues in Japan|Burakumin}}\n{{Main|Americans in Japan|Bangladeshis in Japan|Filipinos in Japan|Iranians in Japan|Indonesians in Japan|Vietnamese people in Japan|Mongolians in Japan|Russians in Japan|Turks in Japan|History of the Jews in Japan}}\n\n[[Burakumin]], [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]], [[Chinese in Japan|Chinese]], and [[Gaikokujin|alien workers]] experienced varying degrees of societal discrimination, some of it severe and longstanding. The approximately 3 million Burakumin (descendants of feudal era \"outcasts\"), although not subject to governmental discrimination, frequently were victims of entrenched societal discrimination, including restricted access to housing and employment opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blhrri.org/blhrri_e/blhrri/buraku.htm|title=What is Buraku Discrimination ?|publisher=Buraku Liberation and Human Rights Research Institute|accessdate=October 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920122257/http://blhrri.org/blhrri_e/blhrri/buraku.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|MOJ]], there were nearly 1.85 million legal foreign residents as of 2002. The largest group, at approximately 625,400, was ethnic Koreans, followed by [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Brazil]]ians, and [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipinos]]. Despite improvements in legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean permanent residents (so-called [[Zainichi Korean]]s, most of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan) were subject to various forms of deeply entrenched societal discrimination. Harassment and threats against pro-[[North Korea]]n organizations and persons reportedly have increased since the 2002 admission by North Korea that it had [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|kidnapped more than a dozen Japanese citizens]]. Other foreigners also were subject to discrimination. There was a widespread perception among Japanese citizens that foreigners committed many [[Crime in Japan|crimes]]. According to a government survey, more than 70% of citizens worried that an increase in the number of illegally employed foreign workers could undermine public safety and result in human rights abuses against the workers themselves. Nevertheless, more than 80% said the country should accept foreign laborers conditionally or unconditionally.<ref>{{cite news|title=70% of Japanese worried about illegal foreign labor: poll+|date=July 24, 2004|publisher=Kyodo World News Service}}</ref>\n\nA controversial [[Japan Immigration Bureau|Immigration Bureau]] website launched in February allows informants to report the name, address, or workplace of any suspicious foreigners for such reasons as \"causing a nuisance in the neighborhood\" and \"causing anxiety\". In the face of protests from human rights groups, the site was amended in March to remove the preset reasons, but remained operational at year's end.\n\nBy law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for naturalization and citizenship rights, including the [[right to vote]]; however, in practice, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, partly due to fears that their cultural identity would be lost.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Obstacles to naturalization included broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and great emphasis on [[Japanese language]] ability. Naturalization procedures also required an extensive background check, including inquiries into the applicant's economic status and assimilation into society. Koreans were given the option of adopting a Japanese surname. The Government defended its naturalization procedures as necessary to ensure the smooth assimilation of foreigners into society. Alien permanent residents may live abroad for up to 4 or 5 years without losing their right to permanent residence in the country.\n\nIn September 2003, the [[School Education Law]] was amended to allow graduates of 21 non-Japanese language schools to become automatically eligible to take university entrance examinations. Previously all students of non-Japanese language schools were required to pass a state-run high school equivalency test to qualify for the examinations. The amended law also enabled universities to set their admissions criteria at their own discretion. During 2003, many national universities also admitted graduates of non-Japanese language schools other than the 21 schools included in the School Education Law amendment.\n\nAs of May 2019, Japan has not ratified the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-calls-member-states-ratify-convention-against-discrimination-education|title=UNESCO calls Member States to ratify the Convention against Discrimination in Education|date=2019-04-19|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Indigenous people: Ryukyuan and Ainu people ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe [[Ainu people]] are people descended from the first inhabitants of the country. Under an 1899 law, the Government pursued a policy of forced assimilation, imposing mandatory Japanese-language education and denying the Ainu their right to continue traditional practices. The law also left the Ainu with control of approximately 0.15% of their original land holdings and empowered the Government to manage communal assets.\n\nAfter a 1997 court ruling, the Diet passed a law that recognized the Ainu as an [[ethnic minority]], required all prefectural governments to develop basic programs for promoting Ainu culture and traditions, canceled previous laws that discriminated against the Ainu, and required the Government of Hokkaid\u014d to return Ainu communal assets. However, the law stopped short of recognizing the Ainu as the indigenous people of Hokkaid\u014d, failed to address whether they deserved special rights as a distinct ethnic group, and did not mandate civil rights protection for the Ainu. A nonbinding accompanying resolution referred to the Ainu as a legal minority.\n\nThe [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] to the [[United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] stated that the Ainu never had entered into a consensual juridical relationship with any state and noted that the lack of such an agreement deprived them of their rights. Many Ainu criticized the Law to Promote Ainu Culture for not advancing Ainu political rights and criticized the Government for not providing funds for noncultural activities that would improve Ainu living conditions or financial status. The Japan Ainu Association, a nationwide organization of Ainu, lobbied the Government for economic assistance and greater social welfare benefits. Although [[Ainu language]] newspapers, radio programs, and academic programs studying Ainu culture have increased, the Ainu continued to face societal discrimination.\n\n== Worker rights ==\n\n=== Right of association ===\nThe Constitution provides for the right of workers to associate freely in [[Labor unions in Japan|unions]]. In 2003, approximately 10.5 million workers, 19.6% of all employees, belonged to labor unions. Unions were free of government control and influence. The [[Sohyo|Japanese Trade Union Confederation]], which represented 6.8 million workers and was formed in 1989 through the merger of several confederations, was the largest labor organization.\n\nSome public employees, including members of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], [[police]], and [[firefighter]]s are not permitted to form unions or to strike. These restrictions have led to a long-running dispute with the ILO Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations over the observance of ILO Convention 98 concerning the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Committee has observed that these public employees have a limited capacity to participate in the process of determining their wages and has asked the Government to consider measures it could take to encourage negotiations with public employees. The Government determines the pay of government employees based on a recommendation by the independent [[National Personnel Authority]].\n\n=== Sexual harassment law in the workplace===\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Law of Japan created in 1972 only advises or recommends employers to take measures to prevent sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is the most reported category labor cases at the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] in Japan.\n\nIn 1999 the Equal Employment Opportunity Act was revised and a provision was added that required employers to take measures to prevent sexual harassment against women in the workplace.  It was revised again in 2007 to include male victims, and it was revised again in 2014 to include same-sex sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/03/25/issues/japan-sees-progress-sexual-harassment-still-dont-get/|title=Japan sees progress on sexual harassment, but some still don't get it|date=March 25, 2015|website=The Japan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Right to organize and bargain collectively ===\nThe Constitution provides unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights were exercised freely, and collective bargaining was practiced widely. The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers exercised this right in practice. There are no export processing zones.\n\n=== Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor ===\nThe Constitution provides that no person shall be held in bondage of any kind. Involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime, is prohibited. Although children were not specified in the provision, this legal prohibition against forced or compulsory labor applies equally to adults and to children. In practice, there were no reports of persons held in bondage or involuntary servitude apart from trafficking victims.\n\nFormer Allied prisoners of war and Chinese and Korean workers continued to press claims in Japanese civil courts and in complaints to the ILO for damages and compensation for forced labor during World War II. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court rejected appeals from former prisoners of war and others who claimed they were forced to work for private Japanese companies as slave laborers during World War II.<ref name=\"HR2004\" /> In July, overturning a district court's 2002 decision against Chinese plaintiffs, a high court ordered [[Nishimatsu]] Construction Company to pay 27.5 million yen in compensation to a group of World War II slave laborers. In January 2003, a U.S. federal appeals court dismissed a number of lawsuits by former prisoners of war and civilians who alleged they had been forced to labor for private Japanese firms during World War II.\n\nJapan has ratified the [[ILO Convention]] on [[Forced Labour Convention|Forced Labour No. 29]] in 1932, yet as of June 2015 still has not ratified [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|Abolition of Forced Labour Convention No. 105]].\n\n=== Prohibition of child labor ===\nThe Constitution bans the employment of children. Both societal values and the rigorous enforcement of the Labor Standards Law protect children from exploitation in the workplace. By law, children under the age of 15 may not be employed, and those under age 18 may not be employed in dangerous or harmful jobs.\n\n=== Acceptable work conditions and minimum wage ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n[[Minimum wage]]s are set on a regional (prefectural) and industry basis, with the input of tripartite (workers, employers, public interest) advisory councils. Employers covered by a minimum wage must post the concerned minimum wages, and compliance with minimum wages was considered widespread. Minimum wage rates ranged according to prefecture from 606 to 710 yen per hour. Minimum wage rates were considered sufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent [[standard of living]].\n\nThe Labor Standards Law provides for a 40-hour work week for most industries and mandates premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, or 8 in a day. However, labor unions frequently criticized the government for failing to enforce maximum [[working hours]] regulations in smaller firms. Activist groups claimed that employers exploited or discriminated against foreign workers, who often had little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal rights.\n\nThe government tried to reduce the inflow of illegal foreign workers by prosecuting employers of such workers. According to NPA figures, 175 persons were charged with \"illegal employment assistance\" during the first half of 2002. The [[Immigration Law]] provides for penalties against employers of undocumented foreign workers. Maximum fines for illegal employment assistance were raised to 3 million yen in December. Suspected foreign workers also may be denied entry for passport, visa, and entry application irregularities. The Government continued to study the foreign worker issue, and several citizens' groups were working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to information on worker rights.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Labor]] effectively administered various laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law. Standards were set by the Ministry of Labor and issued after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Central Labor Standards Council. Labor inspectors have the authority to suspend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice concerns over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working conditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n* [[Ainu people]]\n* [[Demographics of Japan]]\n* [[Ethnic issues in Japan]]\n* [[Flag of Japan]]\n* [[Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country#Japan|Freedom of Information Rights in Japan]]\n* [[Homelessness in Japan]]\n* [[Homosexuality in Japan]]\n* [[Human trafficking in Japan]]\n* [[International child abduction in Japan]]\n* [[LGBT rights in Japan]]\n* [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens]]\n* [[Prostitution in Japan]]\n* [[Raelyn Campbell]]\n* [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan People]]\n* [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Independence Movement]]\n* [[Women in Japan]]\n\n'''International:'''\n* [[Human rights in Central Asia]]\n* [[Human rights in Europe]]\n* [[Human rights in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''This article incorporates text from the [[US State Department]]'s 2003-2007 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]].''\n* {{loc}}\n* [http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/ Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs page on Human Rights in Japan]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.crnjapan.net/ The Japan Children's Rights Network]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100531195353/http://www.jiwe.or.jp/english/law/law1_1_1.html Equal Employment Opportunity Law]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061002152305/http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/151/ Censorship in Japan]\n* [http://newsletters.ahrchk.net/jpn/ AHRC articles, including urgent appeals, statements and open letters into Japanese.
