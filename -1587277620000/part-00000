He is pressured by his parents to take up driving, but refuses because he does not think it is necessary and because his father, Jack, will not stop panicking when he drives. Duncan suddenly takes up an interest in driving to impress his friend and secret crush, Mia. While his mother, Annie, is happy at first, she becomes concerned when she realizes it is for a girl and bans him from going to an electronic music festival when his friends invite him. He sneaks out and they have the time of their lives. However, when driving home, Duncan accidentally knocks down Ol' Oakie, the city's [[List of oldest trees|oldest tree]]. His family finds out the next day and they refuse to speak to him. Duncan gets with his friends and they save a section of the tree stump that Annie and Jack carved their names into when they were younger.
