The culmination of the [[Yorktown campaign]], the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in the North American region, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.<ref>Herring p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1780, about 5,500 French soldiers landed in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] to help their American allies fight the British troops who controlled [[New York City]]. Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French [[West Indies]] fleet of the [[Comte de Grasse]], Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York, or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the [[Chesapeake Bay]], where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].\n\nThe French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. When word of de Grasse's decision arrived, both armies began moving south toward Virginia, engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional troops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown.  He was transporting 500,000 silver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana, Cuba, to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army.<ref>Ch\u00e1vez p. 225</ref> While in Santo Domingo, de Grasse met with [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], an agent of [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] of Spain. De Grasse had planned to leave several of his warships in Santo Domingo. Saavedra promised the assistance of the Spanish navy to protect the French merchant fleet, enabling de Grasse to sail north with all of his warships.<ref>Mitchell p. 23</ref> In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led by [[Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves|Sir Thomas Graves]] that came to relieve Cornwallis at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]. As a result of this victory, de Grasse blocked any escape by sea for Cornwallis. By late September, Washington and Rochambeau arrived, and the army and naval forces completely surrounded Cornwallis.\n\nAfter initial preparations, the Americans and French built their first parallel and began the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781, Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column under [[Wilhelm of the Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken]] took [[Redoubt]] No. 9 and an American column under [[Alexander Hamilton]] took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their [[Siege#Age of gunpowder|second parallel]]. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly. Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] began, resulting in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|Yorktown campaign}}\n[[File:Plan of the Battle of Yorktown 1875.png|left|thumb|upright=1.65|A plan of the Battle of Yorktown drawn in 1875]]\n\n===Franco-American cooperation===\n\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}\n<!--spacing-->\n\nOn December 20, 1780, [[Benedict Arnold]] sailed from New York with 1,500 troops to [[Portsmouth, Virginia]].

After they proved ineffective, he took a larger force of 8 ships in March 1781, and [[Battle of Cape Henry|fought a tactically inconclusive battle with the British fleet]] of [[Marriot Arbuthnot]] at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Destouches withdrew due to the damage sustained to his fleet, leaving Arbuthnot and the British fleet in control of the bay's mouth.<ref name=\"Lengel329\" />\n\nOn March 26, Arnold was joined by 2,300 troops under command of Major General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]], who took command of the combined forces.<ref name=\"Lengel329\" /> Phillips resumed raiding, [[Battle of Blandford|defeating the militia at Blandford]], then burning the tobacco warehouses at [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] on April 25.

Instead, he sent raiders into central Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being recalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette's force of now 4,500 followed him.<ref>Lengel p. 331</ref> General Clinton, in a confusing series of orders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port.<ref>Wickwire, p. 340</ref><ref>Grainger, p. 44</ref>\n\nOn July 6, the French and American armies met at [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], north of New York City.<ref>Davis p. 3</ref> Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never challenged Washington's authority, telling Washington he had come to serve, not to command.<ref>Davis p. 14</ref>\n\nWashington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack.<ref name=\"Lengel332\">Lengel p. 332</ref> Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau disagreed, arguing the fleet in the [[West Indies]] under [[Admiral de Grasse]] was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted.<ref name=\"Lengel332\" />\n\nIn early July, Washington suggested an attack be made at the northern part of [[Manhattan Island]], but his officers and Rochambeau all disagreed.<ref name=\"Lengel333\">Lengel p. 333</ref> Washington continued to probe the New York area until August 14, when he received a letter from de Grasse stating he was headed for Virginia with 29 warships and 3,200 soldiers, but could only remain there until October 14.<ref name=\"Lengel333\" /> De Grasse encouraged Washington to move south so they could launch a joint operation.

General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid.

The culmination of the [[Yorktown campaign]], the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in the North American region, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.<ref>Herring p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1780, about 5,500 French soldiers landed in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] to help their American allies fight the British troops who controlled [[New York City]]. Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French [[West Indies]] fleet of the [[Comte de Grasse]], Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York, or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the [[Chesapeake Bay]], where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].\n\nThe French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. When word of de Grasse's decision arrived, both armies began moving south toward Virginia, engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional troops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown.  He was transporting 500,000 silver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana, Cuba, to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army.<ref>Ch\u00e1vez p. 225</ref> While in Santo Domingo, de Grasse met with [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], an agent of [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] of Spain. De Grasse had planned to leave several of his warships in Santo Domingo. Saavedra promised the assistance of the Spanish navy to protect the French merchant fleet, enabling de Grasse to sail north with all of his warships.<ref>Mitchell p. 23</ref> In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led by [[Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves|Sir Thomas Graves]] that came to relieve Cornwallis at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]. As a result of this victory, de Grasse blocked any escape by sea for Cornwallis. By late September, Washington and Rochambeau arrived, and the army and naval forces completely surrounded Cornwallis.\n\nAfter initial preparations, the Americans and French built their first parallel and began the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781, Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column under [[Wilhelm of the Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken]] took [[Redoubt]] No. 9 and an American column under [[Alexander Hamilton]] took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their [[Siege#Age of gunpowder|second parallel]]. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly. Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] began, resulting in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|Yorktown campaign}}\n[[File:Plan of the Battle of Yorktown 1875.png|left|thumb|upright=1.65|A plan of the Battle of Yorktown drawn in 1875]]\n\n===Franco-American cooperation===\n\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}\n<!--spacing-->\n\nOn December 20, 1780, [[Benedict Arnold]] sailed from New York with 1,500 troops to [[Portsmouth, Virginia]].

After they proved ineffective, he took a larger force of 8 ships in March 1781, and [[Battle of Cape Henry|fought a tactically inconclusive battle with the British fleet]] of [[Marriot Arbuthnot]] at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Destouches withdrew due to the damage sustained to his fleet, leaving Arbuthnot and the British fleet in control of the bay's mouth.<ref name=\"Lengel329\" />\n\nOn March 26, Arnold was joined by 2,300 troops under command of Major General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]], who took command of the combined forces.<ref name=\"Lengel329\" /> Phillips resumed raiding, [[Battle of Blandford|defeating the militia at Blandford]], then burning the tobacco warehouses at [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] on April 25.

Instead, he sent raiders into central Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being recalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette's force of now 4,500 followed him.<ref>Lengel p. 331</ref> General Clinton, in a confusing series of orders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port.<ref>Wickwire, p. 340</ref><ref>Grainger, p. 44</ref>\n\nOn July 6, the French and American armies met at [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], north of New York City.<ref>Davis p. 3</ref> Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never challenged Washington's authority, telling Washington he had come to serve, not to command.<ref>Davis p. 14</ref>\n\nWashington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack.<ref name=\"Lengel332\">Lengel p. 332</ref> Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1.

General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid.

In the Fall of 1680, Tonti was in the la Salle Expedition and 2nd in command of the company.  He and Father Membr\u00e9, passed through the [[Chicago portage]] from the Illinois valley to go to Green Bay (having reached the [[Illinois River]] with La Salle by way of the Kankakee portage). On Jan. 7, 1682, Tonti met La Salle at Chicago, and together with a group of 21 additional Frenchmen and 30 Indians they used the portage on their way to the Mississippi, the mouth of which they reached on April 9, 1682.<ref>http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=t&sel=La%20Salle#e2633</ref> In 1697, Henri Tonti, Michel Accault, and [[Francois de la Foret|Fran\u00e7ois de la For\u00eat]] received permission from Governor Frontenac to establish a fortified trading post at Chicagou managed by Pierre de Liette, Tonti's cousin, a Franco-Italian, which lasted until c.1705. De Liette kept a journal of his experiences living with the Illinois natives for those years he lived with them at the Chicago trading post. De Liette  divided his time from 1691 to 1705 between the Miami at Chicago and the Illinois at [[Fort Crevecoeur|Fort St. Louis de Pimiteoui]], Peoria, which he had helped build. In Chicago, he ran a trading post in partnership with Fran\u00e7ois Daupin de la For\u00eat, Michel Accault, and Henri de Tonti [located probably near today's Tribune Tower] which he had to close, leaving in 1705 after the king revoked his trading license; continued as French commander and trader in the Illinois country until 1720. From Liette's memoirs: \"Most beautiful, you begin to see its fertility at Chicago, unwooded prairies, requiring only to be turned up by the plow, most temperate climate.\" <ref>http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=l&sel=Liette#e1899</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s, Italians settled in Chicago. Originally, most were [[Genoa|Genoese]]. The first generation worked primarily as merchants, restaurateurs, and fruit sellers. Some worked in the plaster industry.<ref name=CandeloroNIU>Candeloro, Dominic. \"[http://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/iht629936.html Chicago's ITALIANS: IMMIGRANTS, ETHNICS, ACHIEVERS, 1850-1985]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6O2EoEdEQ Archive]).

As of 2014, most Italian Americans in Chicago were descended from this immigration wave,<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> which consisted mainly of young men, mostly illiterate and low-income.<ref name=Candeloropethnic229/> In 1920, Chicago had the third-largest ethnic Italian population in the nation, surpassed only by New York City and Philadelphia.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nRudolph J. Vecoli wrote that [[Al Capone]] had damaged the reputation of the Italian community in Chicago.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nDominic Candeloro, author of ''Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005'', stated that \"ballpark\" estimates were that between 1945 and 2005, 25,000 Italians, including recent immigrants from [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]], and [[Sicily]], arrived in Chicago.<ref name=Candeloro19452005p7>Candeloro, ''Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gd2Ln56CofQC&pg=PA7 7].</ref> The Italians who came in this wave were more nationalistic, entrepreneurial and educated than those of previous waves. The Italians settled in [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]], [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]], [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], [[Westchester, Illinois|Westchester]] and elsewhere. But now many Italian residents of [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] and [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]] have moved out of the area and the area now has an increase of Hispanics living there which has started sometime in the 80s and 90s. Many of the Italian residents grew old and died and new Italian residents have not moved into those towns. Candeloro wrote that they \"rescued Italian American life in the city from a total meltdown, injected new enthusiasm into dying institutions and new organizations like the Italian Cultural Center\".<ref name=Candeloro19452005p7/>\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] era, many Little Italies in Chicago disappeared.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> Some were demolished to make way for new institutions and structures. The [[University of Illinois Chicago]], highways, and public housing replaced former Italian neighborhoods. This caused increasing numbers of Italians to move to suburbs west of Chicago.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nIn 1970, there were 202,373 Italian immigrants and children of Italian immigrants living in the Chicago area, making up about 3% of the total population. By 1970, a majority of the ethnic Italians in the Chicago area lived in suburban communities such as Berwyn, [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], and [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. That year, Rudolph J. Vacoli stated that \"vestiges\" of former Italian American communities within Chicago still existed.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\n==Geography==\nAs of 1980, 20,000 of the 138,000 ethnic Italians in the City of Chicago lived in [[Belmont-Cragin]], [[Dunning, Chicago|Dunning]], and [[Montclare, Chicago|Montclare]] areas, giving them the highest concentrations of ethnic Italians.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nThe area at the intersection of 24th Street and Oakley Avenue, southwest of the Chicago Loop, had a group of people from [[Tuscany]], with many from [[Bagni di Lucca]], [[Montecatini Terme]]<!--Source says \"Montecatini\" but \"Montecatini Terme\" is the one in Tuscany-->, and [[Ponte Buggianese]]. Many of the residents of this area worked at the McCormick Reaper plant. A man who grew up in the neighborhood, Peter Venturelli, wrote a dissertation about it. Candeloro wrote that this area was \"perhaps the best preserved Little Italy\" in Chicago in the year 1990.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232>Candeloro, \"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\" p.

An area known as \"Little Hell\" and \"Little Sicily\" in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] had, by 1920, 20,000 Italian Americans and Italian immigrants.<ref name=Candeloropethnic231>Candeloro, \"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\" p.

The community around Santa Maria Addolorata Church in the near northwest side had residents from [[Bari]], [[Sicily]] and elsewhere in Italy. The Taylor Street neighborhood in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] had residents from [[Abruzzo]], [[Bari]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], [[Lucca]], [[Marche]], [[Messina]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]] and [[Salerno]].<ref name=Candeloropethnic231/>\n\nThe Grand Crossing area had Calabrian migrants, and the area at the intersection of 69th Street and Hermitage had migrants from Salerno. [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] had an Italian community from [[Piedmont]]. [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] had an Italian community originating from the Altopiano di Asiago, [[Veneto]]; many of the residents were brickmakers.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\nMany Italians (along with Germans) lived in the area north of the Chicago river in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = It's hard to tell today, but Lincoln Park once was an...|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-20/news/9901070103_1_neighborhood-lincoln-park-zoo-coffeehouses/2|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}</ref> In 1936, a statue of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] was unveiled in [[Lincoln Park]] to a crowd of 5,000 Italian Americans.<ref>\"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1936/05/11/page/3/article/italians-pay-tribute-to-garibaldi Italians Pay Tribute to Garibaldi].\" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

Most of the Chicago Heights Italians originated from [[Amaseno]], [[Lazio]]; [[Caccamo]], [[Sicily]]; [[Castel di Sangro]]; and [[San Benedetto del Tronto]], [[Marche]]. [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] also had an Italian settlement. The men originated from [[Ripacandida]], Basilicata and were railroad workers.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\n==Institutions==\nIn 1907, the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce, an organization promoting US-Italy trade, opened.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nHistorical clubs included the Amasenese Society, the Maroons Soccer Club, and the Mazzini-Verdi Society.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nVecoli wrote that Chicago has 150 Italian organizations. In 1945, the Italian Welfare Council opened, providing recreational, educational, and social services. In 1952, it was replaced by the Italian American Civic Committee, an umbrella organization which sponsors the annual [[Columbus Day]] parade.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\n==Media==\nBeginning in 1960, the newspaper ''[[Fra Noi]]'' was published. By the 1950s/1960s, Italian television and radio programs were available.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nIn previous eras, there were radio programs available for the Italians, with around twelve in the Italian language.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\n==Politics==\nIn Chicago, ethnic Italians have been Chicago aldermen, suburban mayors, county judges, and legislators in the Illinois government. Italian politicians have been elected in [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]], [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]], [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Highwood, Illinois|Highwood]] and [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]].<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nDominic Candeloro stated that, in the City of Chicago, few Italians have been elected to major offices because \"The number of Italians in the larger electoral units has never been great enough to challenge successfully other ethnic groups, and the Mafia image has made it difficult for Italian politicians in larger districts\"<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> Candeloro added, \"There has never been even a serious Italian candidate for [[mayor of Chicago]].\"<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nJerome Cosentino, an ethnic Italian from Chicago, was elected [[Illinois State Treasurer]], becoming the first to hold a statewide office in Illinois.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nItalian Chicago native [[Ralph C. Capparelli]] was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and served for 33 years (13th and 16th District) from 1971\u20132004.\n\nIn 1996, [[Al Salvi]] ran for one of Illinois' US Senate seats, but lost.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\n==Religion==\nThe Italian community was and still is largely Catholic. Vecoli wrote that \"A few Italian inner-city parishes remain, but most were either dissolved or turned over to incoming groups.\"<ref name=VecoliEncyc/> This was a result in many moving out to the suburbs and the influx of Catholics from other ethnicities.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption opened in the first Italian neighborhood in 1881. It was the first Italian Catholic church in Chicago. The Scalabrian Church of Santa Maria Incoronata served Italians living in what is now [[Chinatown, Chicago|Chinatown]]. In the 1980s, the church became a mission of the St. Theresa Church as a way to serve Chinese people. Dominic Candeloro wrote that once the church changed into being a mission, it was no longer the \"focal center\" of the Italian community there.<ref name=\"Candeloropethnic231\"/> The religious institutions in the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago serving Italians included a hospital (founded by [[Mother Cabrini]]) and the Our Lady of Pompeii and Holy Guardian Angel Churches.<ref name=Candeloropethnic231/>\n\nThe community at 69th and Hermitage attended the St. Mary of St. Carmel Church. The Italians in [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] and [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] attended the Scalabrian Church of St. Anthony of Padua. The local church in [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]] was San Rocco, which opened in 1906 and was closed by [[Archbishop of Chicago]] Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] in 1990. The [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] Italian settlement was served by the church of San Donatus.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\nItalian religious street festivals have long occurred in Chicago and, as of the 1990s, several still continued.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nThe [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] (Scalabrini Fathers) had several institutions in the western suburbs.

In the Fall of 1680, Tonti was in the la Salle Expedition and 2nd in command of the company.  He and Father Membr\u00e9, passed through the [[Chicago portage]] from the Illinois valley to go to Green Bay (having reached the [[Illinois River]] with La Salle by way of the Kankakee portage). On Jan. 7, 1682, Tonti met La Salle at Chicago, and together with a group of 21 additional Frenchmen and 30 Indians they used the portage on their way to the Mississippi, the mouth of which they reached on April 9, 1682.<ref>http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=t&sel=La%20Salle#e2633</ref> In 1697, Henri Tonti, Michel Accault, and [[Francois de la Foret|Fran\u00e7ois de la For\u00eat]] received permission from Governor Frontenac to establish a fortified trading post at Chicagou managed by Pierre de Liette, Tonti\u2019s cousin, a Franco-Italian, which lasted until c.1705. De Liette kept a journal of his experiences living with the Illinois natives for those years he lived with them at the Chicago trading post. De Liette  divided his time from 1691 to 1705 between the Miami at Chicago and the Illinois at [[Fort Crevecoeur|Fort St. Louis de Pimiteoui]], Peoria, which he had helped build. In Chicago, he ran a trading post in partnership with Fran\u00e7ois Daupin de la For\u00eat, Michel Accault, and Henri de Tonti [located probably near today's Tribune Tower] which he had to close, leaving in 1705 after the king revoked his trading license; continued as French commander and trader in the Illinois country until 1720. From Liette's memoirs: \"Most beautiful, you begin to see its fertility at Chicago, unwooded prairies, requiring only to be turned up by the plow, most temperate climate.\" <ref>http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=l&sel=Liette#e1899</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s, Italians settled in Chicago. Originally, most were [[Genoa|Genoese]]. The first generation worked primarily as merchants, restaurateurs, and fruit sellers. Some worked in the plaster industry.<ref name=CandeloroNIU>Candeloro, Dominic. \"[http://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/iht629936.html Chicago's ITALIANS: IMMIGRANTS, ETHNICS, ACHIEVERS, 1850-1985]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6O2EoEdEQ Archive]).

Retrieved on March 13, 2014.</ref> The plaster workers originated from [[Lucca]]<!--Lucchese means someone from Lucca-->.<ref name=Candeloropethnic229>Candeloro, \"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\" p.

As of 2014, most Italian Americans in Chicago were descended from this immigration wave,<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> which consisted mainly of young men, mostly illiterate and low-income.<ref name=Candeloropethnic229/> In 1920, Chicago had the third-largest ethnic Italian population in the nation, surpassed only by New York City and Philadelphia.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nRudolph J. Vecoli wrote that [[Al Capone]] had damaged the reputation of the Italian community in Chicago.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nDominic Candeloro, author of ''Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005'', stated that \"ballpark\" estimates were that between 1945 and 2005, 25,000 Italians, including recent immigrants from [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]], and [[Sicily]], arrived in Chicago.<ref name=Candeloro19452005p7>Candeloro, ''Italians in Chicago, 1945-2005'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gd2Ln56CofQC&pg=PA7 7].</ref> The Italians who came in this wave were more nationalistic, entrepreneurial and educated than those of previous waves. The Italians settled in [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]], [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]], [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], [[Westchester, Illinois|Westchester]] and elsewhere. But now many Italian residents of [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] and [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]] have moved out of the area and the area now has an increase of Hispanics living there which has started sometime in the 80s and 90s. Many of the Italian residents grew old and died and new Italian residents have not moved into those towns. Candeloro wrote that they \"rescued Italian American life in the city from a total meltdown, injected new enthusiasm into dying institutions and new organizations like the Italian Cultural Center\".<ref name=Candeloro19452005p7/>\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] era, many Little Italies in Chicago disappeared.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> Some were demolished to make way for new institutions and structures. The [[University of Illinois Chicago]], highways, and public housing replaced former Italian neighborhoods. This caused increasing numbers of Italians to move to suburbs west of Chicago.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nIn 1970, there were 202,373 Italian immigrants and children of Italian immigrants living in the Chicago area, making up about 3% of the total population. By 1970, a majority of the ethnic Italians in the Chicago area lived in suburban communities such as Berwyn, [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], and [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. That year, Rudolph J. Vacoli stated that \"vestiges\" of former Italian American communities within Chicago still existed.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\n==Geography==\nAs of 1980, 20,000 of the 138,000 ethnic Italians in the City of Chicago lived in [[Belmont-Cragin]], [[Dunning, Chicago|Dunning]], and [[Montclare, Chicago|Montclare]] areas, giving them the highest concentrations of ethnic Italians.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nThe area at the intersection of 24th Street and Oakley Avenue, southwest of the Chicago Loop, had a group of people from [[Tuscany]], with many from [[Bagni di Lucca]], [[Montecatini Terme]]<!--Source says \"Montecatini\" but \"Montecatini Terme\" is the one in Tuscany-->, and [[Ponte Buggianese]]. Many of the residents of this area worked at the McCormick Reaper plant. A man who grew up in the neighborhood, Peter Venturelli, wrote a dissertation about it. Candeloro wrote that this area was \"perhaps the best preserved Little Italy\" in Chicago in the year 1990.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232>Candeloro, \"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&pg=PA232 232].</ref>\n\nThe first Italian American community in Chicago was located near what is now the [[Merchandise Mart]] in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and had residents from [[Genoa]] and [[Lucca]]. An area known as \"Little Hell\" and \"Little Sicily\" in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] had, by 1920, 20,000 Italian Americans and Italian immigrants.<ref name=Candeloropethnic231>Candeloro, \"Chicago's Italians, A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850-1990,\" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&pg=PA231 231].</ref>\n\nAn area near [[Polk Street Station]] in the southern end of the [[Chicago Loop]] had residents from [[Ricigliano]], [[Salerno]]. The community around Santa Maria Addolorata Church in the near northwest side had residents from [[Bari]], [[Sicily]] and elsewhere in Italy. The Taylor Street neighborhood in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] had residents from [[Abruzzo]], [[Bari]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], [[Lucca]], [[Marche]], [[Messina]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]] and [[Salerno]].<ref name=Candeloropethnic231/>\n\nThe Grand Crossing area had Calabrian migrants, and the area at the intersection of 69th Street and Hermitage had migrants from Salerno. [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] had an Italian community from [[Piedmont]]. [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] had an Italian community originating from the Altopiano di Asiago, [[Veneto]]; many of the residents were brickmakers.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\nMany Italians (along with Germans) lived in the area north of the Chicago river in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = It's hard to tell today, but Lincoln Park once was an...|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-20/news/9901070103_1_neighborhood-lincoln-park-zoo-coffeehouses/2|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}</ref> In 1936, a statue of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] was unveiled in [[Lincoln Park]] to a crowd of 5,000 Italian Americans.<ref>\"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1936/05/11/page/3/article/italians-pay-tribute-to-garibaldi Italians Pay Tribute to Garibaldi].\" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Monday May 11, 1936. page 3.</ref>\n\nBy 1920, 50% of [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]] was ethnic Italian. Most of the Chicago Heights Italians originated from [[Amaseno]], [[Lazio]]; [[Caccamo]], [[Sicily]]; [[Castel di Sangro]]; and [[San Benedetto del Tronto]], [[Marche]]. [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] also had an Italian settlement. The men originated from [[Ripacandida]], Basilicata and were railroad workers.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\n==Institutions==\nIn 1907, the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce, an organization promoting US-Italy trade, opened.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nHistorical clubs included the Amasenese Society, the Maroons Soccer Club, and the Mazzini-Verdi Society.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nVecoli wrote that Chicago has 150 Italian organizations. In 1945, the Italian Welfare Council opened, providing recreational, educational, and social services. In 1952, it was replaced by the Italian American Civic Committee, an umbrella organization which sponsors the annual [[Columbus Day]] parade.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\n==Media==\nBeginning in 1960, the newspaper ''[[Fra Noi]]'' was published. By the 1950s/1960s, Italian television and radio programs were available.<ref name=VecoliEncyc/>\n\nIn previous eras, there were radio programs available for the Italians, with around twelve in the Italian language.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\n==Politics==\nIn Chicago, ethnic Italians have been Chicago aldermen, suburban mayors, county judges, and legislators in the Illinois government. Italian politicians have been elected in [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]], [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]], [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Highwood, Illinois|Highwood]] and [[Melrose Park, Illinois|Melrose Park]].<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nDominic Candeloro stated that, in the City of Chicago, few Italians have been elected to major offices because \"The number of Italians in the larger electoral units has never been great enough to challenge successfully other ethnic groups, and the Mafia image has made it difficult for Italian politicians in larger districts\"<ref name=CandeloroNIU/> Candeloro added, \"There has never been even a serious Italian candidate for [[mayor of Chicago]].\"<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nJerome Cosentino, an ethnic Italian from Chicago, was elected [[Illinois State Treasurer]], becoming the first to hold a statewide office in Illinois.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nItalian Chicago native [[Ralph C. Capparelli]] was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and served for 33 years (13th and 16th District) from 1971-2004.\n\nIn 1996, [[Al Salvi]] ran for one of Illinois' US Senate seats, but lost.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\n==Religion==\nThe Italian community was and still is largely Catholic. Vecoli wrote that \"A few Italian inner-city parishes remain, but most were either dissolved or turned over to incoming groups.\"<ref name=VecoliEncyc/> This was a result in many moving out to the suburbs and the influx of Catholics from other ethnicities.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption opened in the first Italian neighborhood in 1881. It was the first Italian Catholic church in Chicago. The Scalabrian Church of Santa Maria Incoronata served Italians living in what is now [[Chinatown, Chicago|Chinatown]]. In the 1980s, the church became a mission of the St. Theresa Church as a way to serve Chinese people. Dominic Candeloro wrote that once the church changed into being a mission, it was no longer the \"focal center\" of the Italian community there.<ref name=\"Candeloropethnic231\"/> The religious institutions in the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago serving Italians included a hospital (founded by [[Mother Cabrini]]) and the Our Lady of Pompeii and Holy Guardian Angel Churches.<ref name=Candeloropethnic231/>\n\nThe community at 69th and Hermitage attended the St. Mary of St. Carmel Church. The Italians in [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] and [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] attended the Scalabrian Church of St. Anthony of Padua. The local church in [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]] was San Rocco, which opened in 1906 and was closed by [[Archbishop of Chicago]] Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] in 1990. The [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] Italian settlement was served by the church of San Donatus.<ref name=Candeloropethnic232/>\n\nItalian religious street festivals have long occurred in Chicago and, as of the 1990s, several still continued.<ref name=CandeloroNIU/>\n\nThe [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] (Scalabrini Fathers) had several institutions in the western suburbs.

The Italian Navy assumed its present name after the Italian monarchy was abolished following a popular referendum held on June 2, 1946.\n\n===After World War II===\n\nAt the end of its five years involvement in [[World War II]], Italy was a devastated nation. After the end of hostilities the ''Regia Marina'', which at the beginning of the war was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships, started a long and complex rebuilding process. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on September 8, 1943, and the subsequent cooperation agreement on September 23, 1943, left the Regia Marina in a poor condition, with much of its infrastructure and bases unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state, which was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels. The vessels that remained were:\n* 5 battleships\n* 10 cruisers\n* 10 destroyers\n* 20 frigates\n* 20 corvettes\n* 50 fast coastal patrol units\n* 50 minesweepers\n* 19 amphibious operations vessels\n* 5 school ships\n* 1 support ship and plane transport\n\n===The peace treaty===\n\nThe [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|peace treaty]] signed on February 10, 1947 in Paris was onerous for Regia Marina. Apart from territorial and material losses, also the following restrictions were imposed:\n* A ban on owning, building or experimenting with atomic weapons, self-propulsion projectiles or relative launchers, etc.\n* A ban on owning battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and amphibious assault units.\n* A ban on operating military installations on the islands of [[Pantelleria]], [[Pianosa]] and on the archipelago of [[Pelagie Islands]].\n\n[[File:CV Aquila LaSpezia Jun51 NAN5-63.jpg|thumb|right|Aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}} just before being scrapped in [[La Spezia]], 1951]]\n\nThe treaty also ordered Italy to put the following ships at the disposals of the victorious nations United States, [[Soviet Union]], Great Britain, France, [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] as war compensation:\n* 3 Battleships: ''Giulio Cesare'', ''Italia'', ''Vittorio Veneto'';\n* 5 Cruisers: ''Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta'', ''Attilio Regolo'', ''Scipione Africano'', ''Eugenio di Savoia'' and ''Eritrea'';\n* 7 Destroyers, 5 of the {{sclass2-|Soldati|destroyer|4}} and ''Augusto Riboty'' and ''Alfredo Oriani'';\n* 6 Minesweepers: like ''Aliseo'' and ''Fortunale'';\n* 8 Submarines: 3 of the ''Acciaio'' class;\n* 1 Sailing School ship: ''Cristoforo Colombo''.\n\n===The entry into NATO===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n\nGreat changes in the international political situation, which were developing into the Cold War, convinced the United Kingdom and United States to discontinue the transfer of Italy's capital ships as war reparations. Some had already been dismantled in [[La Spezia]] between 1948 and 1955, including the aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}}. However, the [[Soviet Union]] demanded the surrender of the battleship ''Giulio Cesare'' and other naval units designated for transfer. The [[cruiser]]s ''Attilio Regolo'' and ''Scipione Africano'' became the French ''Chateaurenault'' and ''Guichen'', while ''{{ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}}'' became the Greek ''Elli''. After break up and/or transfers, only a small part of the fleet remained to be recommissioned into the Marina. As Western attention turned to the Soviets and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italian seas became one of the main sites of confrontation between the two superpowers, contributing to the re-emergence of Italy's naval importance thanks to her strategic geographical position.\n\nWith the new elections in 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became a Republic, and the Regia Marina took the name of ''Marina Militare'' (Military Navy). As the [[Marshall Plan]] began to rebuild Italy and Europe was rapidly being divided into two geopolitically antagonistic blocs, Italy began talks with the United States to guarantee adequate security considerations. The US government in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] wished to keep its own installations on the [[Italian Peninsula]] and relaxed the Treaty restrictions by including Italy in the Mutual Defense Assistance Programme (MDAP). On April 4, 1949, Italy joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and, in order for the navy to contribute actively in the organization, the Treaty restrictions were definitively repealed by the end of 1951, with the consent of all of Western nations.\n\n[[File:Carriers Cavour (550) - Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) and Charles de Gaulle (R91) underway in 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour|carrier ''Cavour'']] in the [[Gulf of Oman]], 2013]]\n\nWithin NATO, the Italian Navy was assigned combat control of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Strait of Otranto]], as well as the defence of the naval routes through the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. To ensure these tasks a \"''Studio sul potenziamento della Marina italiana in relazione al Patto Atlantico''\" (Study about the development of the Italian Navy with reference to the Atlantic Pact) was undertaken, which researched the structures and the methods for the development of the navy.\n\n==Naval ensign==\n[[File:Naval Ensign of Italy.svg|thumb|Naval ensign of Italy]]\n\nThe [[ensign]] of the Italian Navy is the [[Flag of Italy|Italian tricolour]] defaced with the coat of arms of the Marina Militare. The quarters refer to the four Medieval Italian [[Thalassocracy|Thalassocracies]], or \"[[Maritime Republics]]\" (Italian: ''Repubbliche Marinare''):\n* 1st quarter: on red, a golden winged lion (the [[Lion of St. Mark]]) wielding a sword ([[Republic of Venice]]);\n* 2nd quarter: on white field, red cross ([[Republic of Genoa]]);\n* 3rd quarter: on blue field, white [[Maltese cross]] ([[Republic of Amalfi]]);\n* 4th quarter: on red field, white [[Pisan cross]] ([[Republic of Pisa]]).\nThe shield has a golden crown, that distinguishes military vessels from merchant: the crown, \"''corona [[rostrata]]''\", was proposed in 1939 by Admiral [[Domenico Cavagnari]] to the Government, as an acknowledgement of the Italian Navy's [[Roman navy|origin in Roman times]]. In the proposal, Adm. Cavagnari wrote that \"in order to recall the common origin [of the Navy] from the Roman sailorship, the Insignia will be surmounted by the towered Crown with rostra, the emblem of honour and valour the [[Roman Senate]] awarded to the leaders of naval victories, conquerors of lands and cities across the seas\".\n\nA further difference is that St. Mark's lion, symbolising the Republic of Venice, does not hold the gospel in its paw (as it does on the civil ensign, where the book is open at the words \"''Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus''\", meaning \"Peace to you Mark, my Evangelist\") and is wielding a sword instead: such an image is consistent with the pictorial tradition from Venetian history, in which the book is shown open during peacetime and closed during wartime.\n\n==Structure and organisation==\n\n===Organization===\nIn 2012 the Navy began a restructuring process that will see a 21% decrease in personnel by 2025.

As of August 2014, the Italian Navy had a strength of 30,923 active personnel with approximately 184 vessels in service, including minor auxiliary vessels.

The Italian Navy assumed its present name after the Italian monarchy was abolished following a popular referendum held on June 2, 1946.\n\n===After World War II===\n\nAt the end of its five years involvement in [[World War II]], Italy was a devastated nation. After the end of hostilities the ''Regia Marina'', which at the beginning of the war was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships, started a long and complex rebuilding process. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on September 8, 1943, and the subsequent cooperation agreement on September 23, 1943, left the Regia Marina in a poor condition, with much of its infrastructure and bases unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state, which was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels. The vessels that remained were:\n* 5 battleships\n* 10 cruisers\n* 10 destroyers\n* 20 frigates\n* 20 corvettes\n* 50 fast coastal patrol units\n* 50 minesweepers\n* 19 amphibious operations vessels\n* 5 school ships\n* 1 support ship and plane transport\n\n===The peace treaty===\n\nThe [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|peace treaty]] signed on February 10, 1947 in Paris was onerous for Regia Marina. Apart from territorial and material losses, also the following restrictions were imposed:\n* A ban on owning, building or experimenting with atomic weapons, self-propulsion projectiles or relative launchers, etc.\n* A ban on owning battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and amphibious assault units.\n* A ban on operating military installations on the islands of [[Pantelleria]], [[Pianosa]] and on the archipelago of [[Pelagie Islands]].\n\n[[File:CV Aquila LaSpezia Jun51 NAN5-63.jpg|thumb|right|Aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}} just before being scrapped in [[La Spezia]], 1951]]\n\nThe treaty also ordered Italy to put the following ships at the disposals of the victorious nations United States, [[Soviet Union]], Great Britain, France, [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] as war compensation:\n* 3 Battleships: ''Giulio Cesare'', ''Italia'', ''Vittorio Veneto'';\n* 5 Cruisers: ''Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta'', ''Attilio Regolo'', ''Scipione Africano'', ''Eugenio di Savoia'' and ''Eritrea'';\n* 7 Destroyers, 5 of the {{sclass2-|Soldati|destroyer|4}} and ''Augusto Riboty'' and ''Alfredo Oriani'';\n* 6 Minesweepers: like ''Aliseo'' and ''Fortunale'';\n* 8 Submarines: 3 of the ''Acciaio'' class;\n* 1 Sailing School ship: ''Cristoforo Colombo''.\n\n===The entry into NATO===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n\nGreat changes in the international political situation, which were developing into the Cold War, convinced the United Kingdom and United States to discontinue the transfer of Italy's capital ships as war reparations. Some had already been dismantled in [[La Spezia]] between 1948 and 1955, including the aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}}. However, the [[Soviet Union]] demanded the surrender of the battleship ''Giulio Cesare'' and other naval units designated for transfer. The [[cruiser]]s ''Attilio Regolo'' and ''Scipione Africano'' became the French ''Chateaurenault'' and ''Guichen'', while ''{{ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}}'' became the Greek ''Elli''. After break up and/or transfers, only a small part of the fleet remained to be recommissioned into the Marina. As Western attention turned to the Soviets and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italian seas became one of the main sites of confrontation between the two superpowers, contributing to the re-emergence of Italy's naval importance thanks to her strategic geographical position.\n\nWith the new elections in 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became a Republic, and the Regia Marina took the name of ''Marina Militare'' (Military Navy). As the [[Marshall Plan]] began to rebuild Italy and Europe was rapidly being divided into two geopolitically antagonistic blocs, Italy began talks with the United States to guarantee adequate security considerations. The US government in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] wished to keep its own installations on the [[Italian Peninsula]] and relaxed the Treaty restrictions by including Italy in the Mutual Defense Assistance Programme (MDAP). On April 4, 1949, Italy joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and, in order for the navy to contribute actively in the organization, the Treaty restrictions were definitively repealed by the end of 1951, with the consent of all of Western nations.\n\n[[File:Carriers Cavour (550) - Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) and Charles de Gaulle (R91) underway in 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour|carrier ''Cavour'']] in the [[Gulf of Oman]], 2013]]\n\nWithin NATO, the Italian Navy was assigned combat control of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Strait of Otranto]], as well as the defence of the naval routes through the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. To ensure these tasks a \"''Studio sul potenziamento della Marina italiana in relazione al Patto Atlantico''\" (Study about the development of the Italian Navy with reference to the Atlantic Pact) was undertaken, which researched the structures and the methods for the development of the navy.\n\n==Naval ensign==\n[[File:Naval Ensign of Italy.svg|thumb|Naval ensign of Italy]]\n\nThe [[ensign]] of the Italian Navy is the [[Flag of Italy|Italian tricolour]] defaced with the coat of arms of the Marina Militare. The quarters refer to the four Medieval Italian [[Thalassocracy|Thalassocracies]], or \"[[Maritime Republics]]\" (Italian: ''Repubbliche Marinare''):\n* 1st quarter: on red, a golden winged lion (the [[Lion of St. Mark]]) wielding a sword ([[Republic of Venice]]);\n* 2nd quarter: on white field, red cross ([[Republic of Genoa]]);\n* 3rd quarter: on blue field, white [[Maltese cross]] ([[Republic of Amalfi]]);\n* 4th quarter: on red field, white [[Pisan cross]] ([[Republic of Pisa]]).\nThe shield has a golden crown, that distinguishes military vessels from merchant: the crown, \"''corona [[rostrata]]''\", was proposed in 1939 by Admiral [[Domenico Cavagnari]] to the Government, as an acknowledgement of the Italian Navy's [[Roman navy|origin in Roman times]]. In the proposal, Adm. Cavagnari wrote that \"in order to recall the common origin [of the Navy] from the Roman sailorship, the Insignia will be surmounted by the towered Crown with rostra, the emblem of honour and valour the [[Roman Senate]] awarded to the leaders of naval victories, conquerors of lands and cities across the seas\".\n\nA further difference is that St. Mark's lion, symbolising the Republic of Venice, does not hold the gospel in its paw (as it does on the civil ensign, where the book is open at the words \"''Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus''\", meaning \"Peace to you Mark, my Evangelist\") and is wielding a sword instead: such an image is consistent with the pictorial tradition from Venetian history, in which the book is shown open during peacetime and closed during wartime.\n\n==Structure and organisation==\n\n===Organization===\nIn 2012 the Navy began a restructuring process that will see a 21% decrease in personnel by 2025.

Some Italians immigrants came to the [[Port of Baltimore]] by boat. The earliest Italian settlers in Baltimore were sailors from [[Genoa]], the capital city of the Italian region of [[Liguria]], who arrived during the 1840s and 1850s. Later immigrants came from [[Naples]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Cefal\u00f9]], and [[Province of Palermo|Palermo]].

The Italian immigrants who arrived by train would enter the city through the [[President Street Station]]. Because of this, the Italians largely settled in a nearby neighborhood that is now known as [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]].\n\nLittle Italy comprises 6 blocks bounded by Pratt Street to the North, the [[Inner Harbor]] to the South, Eden Street to the East, and President Street to the West. Other neighborhoods where large numbers of Italians settled include [[Lexington, Baltimore|Lexington]], [[Belair-Edison, Baltimore|Belair-Edison]], and Cross Street. Many settled along [[Lombard Street (Baltimore)|Lombard Street]], which was named after the Italian town of [[Guardia Lombardi]]. The Italian community, overwhelmingly [[Catholic Church in Italy|Roman Catholic]], established a number of Italian-American parishes such as [[St. Leo's Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|St. Leo's Church]] and Our Lady of Pompeii Church.

Some Italians immigrants came to the [[Port of Baltimore]] by boat. The earliest Italian settlers in Baltimore were sailors from [[Genoa]], the capital city of the Italian region of [[Liguria]], who arrived during the 1840s and 1850s. Later immigrants came from [[Naples]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Cefal\u00f9]], and [[Province of Palermo|Palermo]]. These immigrants created the monument to [[Christopher Columbus]] in [[Druid Hill Park]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Italian American Experience: An Encyclopedia |last=Lagumina |first=S. |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Garland Publishing]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-203-80114-8 |page=51 |pages= |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2SZ5avlZ24C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=Baltimore+Italian&source=bl&ots=2pCBENtP6h&sig=dfWV414EAa-00pyVrdKGuWIP7yQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dkd1UPD3D6fG0AHVjIC4Bw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Many other Italians came by train after entering the country through [[New York City]]'s [[Ellis Island]]. The Italian immigrants who arrived by train would enter the city through the [[President Street Station]]. Because of this, the Italians largely settled in a nearby neighborhood that is now known as [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]].\n\nLittle Italy comprises 6 blocks bounded by Pratt Street to the North, the [[Inner Harbor]] to the South, Eden Street to the East, and President Street to the West. Other neighborhoods where large numbers of Italians settled include [[Lexington, Baltimore|Lexington]], [[Belair-Edison, Baltimore|Belair-Edison]], and Cross Street. Many settled along [[Lombard Street (Baltimore)|Lombard Street]], which was named after the Italian town of [[Guardia Lombardi]]. The Italian community, overwhelmingly [[Catholic Church in Italy|Roman Catholic]], established a number of Italian-American parishes such as [[St. Leo's Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|St. Leo's Church]] and Our Lady of Pompeii Church. The Our Lady of Pompeii Church holds the annual Highlandtown Wine Festival, which celebrates Italian-American culture and benefits the Highlandtown community association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/05/18/raise-a-glass-for-the-9th-annual-highlandtown-wine-festival/ |title= Raise A Glass For The 9th Annual Highlandtown Wine Festival|publisher= [[WJZ-TV|CBS Baltimore]]|accessdate=2015-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe [[August 2016 Central Italy earthquake]] affected Baltimore's Italian community, as many Baltimore Italian-Americans have friends or relatives living in [[Italy]].
