It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid4fiv6dvoAhXAg3IEHR_EAdwQ6AEwCHoECAcQAg#v=onepage&q=Sailing%20yacht&f=false|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}[[File:Newport Beach California 6 march 9 2014 photo d ramey logan.jpg|thumb|[[Newport Beach, California]] (United States), March 2014]]The number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year.

The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid4fiv6dvoAhXAg3IEHR_EAdwQ6AEwCHoECAcQAg#v=onepage&q=Sailing%20yacht&f=false|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}[[File:Newport Beach California 6 march 9 2014 photo d ramey logan.jpg|thumb|[[Newport Beach, California]] (United States), March 2014]]The number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year.

Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of  410-520 AD  This ship has been named \"[[Sinop D]]\" by the Ballard team.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2008, Ballard and his team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15\u201330&nbsp;km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, to examine the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nAlthough Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the [[Crimean peninsula]]. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called [[amphorae]], were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor.

At a depth of 150m, the Black Sea contains insufficient oxygen to support most familiar biological life forms.\n\n==Meromictic composition and preservation==\nOriginally a land-locked fresh water lake, the Black Sea was flooded with salt water from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Holocene]].

The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey.\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn a series of expeditions beginning around 2000, the [[NOAA]] Ocean Exploration program led by [[Robert Ballard]] identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly {{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water off the [[Black Sea]] coast of modern [[Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/07blacksea/welcome.html|title=NOAA Ocean Explorer: Okeanos Explorer: A New Paradigm for Exploration|website=oceanexplorer.noaa.gov|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe team discovered three ancient wrecks to the west of the town of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] at depths of {{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, to examine the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nAlthough Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the [[Crimean peninsula]]. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called [[amphorae]], were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as [[olive oil]], [[honey]], [[wine]] or [[fish]] sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the ship\u2019s construction techniques.

Following the sudden demise of his father and the subsequent controversial accession to the throne of his younger brother, the Ofiranoye while Onayelu was away hunting, he decided to migrate from [[Ijebu Ode]] to settle permanently on the large expanse of land where he had been hunting and known today as Ijebu Igbo.\n\n== Classification ==\nIjebu Igbo is divided into five clans; Oke-Sopin, Oke-Agbo, Ojowo, Atikori, and Japara. \n\nAn [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] (king) is enthroned to govern each of these clans.

Around the late 1970s, such reforms were deemed as burdensome on economic growth and many politicians espousing [[neoliberalism]] started promoting deregulation.\n\n[[File:France Telecom Wellington NZ.jpg|thumb|150px|As a result of deregulation, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] operates phone booths in Wellington, New Zealand.]]\nThe stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to raised levels of competitiveness, therefore higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], more efficiency and lower prices overall. Opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding [[pollution|environmental pollution]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90017-5|title=An ecological-economic assessment of deregulation of international commerce under GATT|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=9|pages=73\u201392|year=1994|last1=Daly|first1=Herman|last2=Goodland|first2=Robert}}</ref> and environmental quality standards (such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials), financial uncertainty, and [[Competition law|constraining monopolies]].\n\n[[Regulatory reform]] is a parallel development alongside deregulation. Regulatory reform refers to organized and ongoing programs to review regulations with a view to minimizing, simplifying, and making them more cost effective.  Such efforts, given impetus by the ''[[Regulatory Flexibility Act]]'' of 1980, are embodied in the United States Office of Management and Budget's [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], and the United Kingdom's [[Better Regulation Commission]]. [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis]] is frequently used in such reviews. In addition, there have been regulatory innovations, usually suggested by economists, such as [[emissions trading]].\n\nDeregulation can be distinguished from [[privatization]], where privatization can be seen as taking state-owned service providers into the private sector.\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[Argentina]] underwent heavy economic deregulation, [[privatization]], and had a [[fixed exchange rate]] during the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] administration (1989\u20131999).

This introduced now familiar requirements for \"regulatory impact statements\", but compliance by governmental agencies took many years. The labour market under the Hawke/Keating Labor governments operated under [[Prices and Incomes Accord|an accord]]. [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia]]  in 1996 [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|began deregulation]] of the labor market, subsequently taken much further in 2005  through their [[WorkChoices]] policy. However, it was reversed under the following [[Rudd Government (2007\u201310)|Rudd Labor government]].\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Ontario electricity policy}}\n\nNatural gas is deregulated in most of the country, with the exception of some Atlantic provinces and some pockets like Vancouver Island and Medicine Hat.

The other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers.   Customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company (LDC) or a deregulated supplier.   In most provinces the LDC is not allowed to offer a term contract, just a variable price based on the spot market.   LDC prices are changed either monthly or quarterly.\n\nThe province of [[Ontario]] began deregulation of electricity supply in 2002, but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility.<ref name=\"PIAC\"/> The government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework.\n\nThe current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation. The remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers.  However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision. Customers are free to choose which company they sign up with, but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition.   If they choose they may remain with the utility at the Regulated Rate Option.\n\nFormer Premier Ralph Klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the Enron model, and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous [[Enron#California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis|California electricity crisis]] (and the collapse of [[Enron scandal|Enron]] because of illegal accounting practices.)\n\n=== European Union ===\n* 2003 Corrections to EU directive about [[software patent]]s\n* Deregulation of the [[aircraft|air industry]] in Europe in 1992 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe taxi industry was deregulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] leading to an influx of new taxis.

These included [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|express coach]] ([[Transport Act 1980]]), [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (completed in 1984), [[privatisation of London bus services]] (1984), [[bus deregulation in Great Britain|local bus services]] ([[Transport Act 1985]]) and [[privatisation of British Rail|the railways]] (1993). The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant. This act has often been criticised and called \"The abolition of Parliament Act\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[New Labour]] did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had already been privatised by the previous Conservative government. However, some government-owned businesses such as [[Qinetiq]] were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the [[public\u2013private partnership]], with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the [[National Health Service|NHS]], building new state schools, and maintaining the [[London Underground]]. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, instead being offered to commercial companies only.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Postal deregulation New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets.]]\n{{See also|Economy of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand Governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from 1984 to 1995.

The policies had the goal of liberalising the economy and were notable for their very comprehensive coverage and innovations. Specific policies included: floating the exchange rate; establishing an independent reserve bank; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation.  Economic growth was resumed in 1991. New Zealand was changed from a somewhat closed and centrally controlled economy to one of the most open economies in the OECD.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v34y1996i4p1856-1902.html\n|title=Economic Reform in New Zealand 1984\u201395: The Pursuit of Efficiency\n|first=Lewis\n|last=Evans\n|first2= Arthur\n|last2= Grimes\n|first3= Bryce\n|last3= Wilkinson\n|journal= Journal of Economic Literature\n|volume= 34 | issue = 4\n|pages= 1856\u2013902\n|date=December 1996\n|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref> As a result, New Zealand, went from having a reputation as an almost socialist country to being considered one of the most business-friendly countries of the world, next to Singapore.

The main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector (see [[RAO UES]]), with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Deregulation of the natural gas sector ([[Gazprom]]) is one of the more frequent demands placed upon Russia by the United States and European Union.\n\n=== United States ===\n\n==== History of regulation ====\n\nOne problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government [[regulation|regulatory agencies]], using them to serve the industries' interests. Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].  However, historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the Depression.\n\n==== Deregulation 1970\u20132000 ====\nDeregulation gained momentum in the 1970s, influenced by research by the [[Chicago school of economics]] and the theories of [[George Stigler]], [[Alfred Kahn]]<ref name=\"kahn_obit_2010_12_29_nytimes_com\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/29kahn.html\n|title=Alfred E.

The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.{{citation needed}}\n\n===== Reagan administration =====\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of [[Milton Friedman]] led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\n==== Energy ====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US. Regulation characteristics of Natural Gas Choice programs vary between the laws of the currently adoptive 21 states (as of 2008).\n\n{{anchor|U.S. electricity}} Deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began in 1992.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n==== Finance ====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

The other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers.   Customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company (LDC) or a deregulated supplier.   In most provinces the LDC is not allowed to offer a term contract, just a variable price based on the spot market.   LDC prices are changed either monthly or quarterly.\n\nThe province of [[Ontario]] began deregulation of electricity supply in 2002, but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility.<ref name=\"PIAC\"/> The government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework.\n\nThe current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation. The remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers.  However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision.

The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant.

Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].

The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.{{citation needed}}\n\n===== Reagan administration =====\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of [[Milton Friedman]] led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\n==== Energy ====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US. Regulation characteristics of Natural Gas Choice programs vary between the laws of the currently adoptive 21 states (as of 2008).\n\n{{anchor|U.S. electricity}} Deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began in 1992.

Wireless, traditional landline telephone, and cable companies increasingly invade each other's traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n==== Finance ====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

More and more homogenization of financial institution which may also be a result of deregulation turns out to be a major concern for small-scale producers in those countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Too much of the same |author=Jayati Gosh |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/globally-harmonised-banking-regulation-does-not-serve-developing-countries-needs}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Deregulated capitalism]]\n*[[Ease of Doing Business Index]]\n*[[Electricity provider switching]]\n*[[Political economy]]\n*[[Public service company]]\n*[[Regulatory reform]]\n*[[Stranded costs]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Black |first= William K. |authorlink= William K.

Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791, but it was unfinished at [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his death]] on 5 December the same year. A completed version dated 1792 by [[Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr]] was delivered to Count [[Franz von Walsegg]], who commissioned the piece for a Requiem service to commemorate the anniversary of his wife's death on 14 February.\n\nThe autograph manuscript shows the finished and [[Orchestration|orchestrated]] [[Introit]] in Mozart's hand, and detailed drafts of the [[Kyrie]] and the [[sequence (musical form)|sequence]] [[Dies irae]] as far as the first eight bars of the ''[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]'' [[Movement (music)|movement]], and the [[Offertory]]. It cannot be shown to what extent S\u00fcssmayr may have depended on now lost \"scraps of paper\" for the remainder; he later claimed the [[Sanctus|Sanctus and Benedictus]] and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]] as his own.\n\nWalsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition, as he is known to have done with other works. This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart's widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]]. She was responsible for a number of stories surrounding the composition of the work, including the claims that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious messenger who did not reveal the commissioner's identity, and that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the requiem for his own funeral.\n\nIn addition to the S\u00fcssmayr version, a number of alternative completions have been developed by musicologists in the 20th century.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe Requiem is scored for 2 [[basset horn]]s in F, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[trumpet]]s in D, 3 [[trombone]]s ([[Alto trombone|alto]], [[Tenor trombone|tenor]], and [[Bass Trombone|bass]]), [[timpani]] (2 drums), [[violin]]s, [[viola]], and [[basso continuo]] ([[cello]], [[double bass]], and [[Pipe organ|organ]]). The basset horn parts are sometimes played on conventional [[clarinet]]s, even though this changes the sonority.\n\nThe vocal forces consist of [[soprano]], [[contralto]], [[tenor]], and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] soloists and an [[SATB]] mixed [[choir]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:K626 Requiem Mozart.jpg|thumb|325x325px|The first page of Mozart's autograph score]]\nS\u00fcssmayr's completion divides the [[Requiem]] into eight sections:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|'''[[Introit]]us'''}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha|Requiem aeternam}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=2\n|'''[[Kyrie]]'''\n|'''[[Sequence (musical form)|Sequentia]]''' (text based on sections of the [[Dies irae]])\n}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|[[Dies irae]]|Tuba mirum|Rex tremendae\n|Recordare|Confutatis|[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=4|'''[[Offertory|Offertorium]]'''}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|Domine Jesu\n|Hostias}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=5\n|'''[[Sanctus]]'''\n|'''Benedictus''' \n|'''[[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]'''|'''[[Communion (chant)|Communio]]'''\n}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha|Lux aeterna|Cum sanctis tuis}}\n\nAll sections from the Sanctus onwards are not present in Mozart's manuscript fragment.

The first five measures of this passage (without the accompaniment) are shown below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    { \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\tempo Adagio\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"clarinet\"\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 46\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n                s1 s1 r2 r4 d^\\p^~ d cis d e f2 e4 c^~ c4\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemDown\n                R1 r4 a2\\p_( gis4) a_( b c) bes8 a bes4 a8 g a4 b c8 b16 a g2 a8_( g) f2\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"bassoon\"\n            \\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn\n            \\mergeDifferentlyDottedOn\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n                r4 d2^\\markup {\\dynamic p}( cis4) d( e f2) e2.( fis4) g f!8 e f4 b,8^( e^~ e8 d16 c d4 e2^~) e4\n\n                }\n\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown\n                s1 s1 s1 r4 a2\\p_( gis4 a b c2) a4\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThis theme is modeled after [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[The Ways of Zion Do Mourn / Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline|The ways of Zion do mourn]]'', HWV 264. Many parts of the work make reference to this passage, notably in the [[coloratura]] in the Kyrie [[fugue]] and in the conclusion of the Lacrimosa.\n\nThe trombones then announce the entry of the choir, which breaks into the theme, with the basses alone for the first measure, followed by imitation by the other parts. The chords play off [[Syncopation|syncopated]] and staggered structures in the accompaniment, thus underlining the solemn and steady nature of the music. A soprano solo is sung to the ''Te decet hymnus'' text in the [[Reciting tone#tonus peregrinus|tonus peregrinus]] (also known as the 9th Gregorian mode). The choir follows along on the same motifs. Then, the principal theme is treated by the choir and the orchestra in downward-gliding sixteenth-notes. The courses of the melodies, whether held up or moving down, change and interlace amongst themselves, while passages in [[counterpoint]] and in unison (e.g., ''Et lux perpetua'') alternate; all this creates the charm of this movement, which finishes with a [[Cadence (music)#Half cadence|half cadence]] on the [[dominant (music)|dominant]].\n\n===II. Kyrie===\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 02. Kyrie eleison.ogg\n|title=Kyrie\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Kyrie follows without pause (''attacca''). It is a [[double fugue]] also on a Handelian theme: the [[Subject (music)|subject]] is based on \"[[Messiah Part II#25|And with his stripes we are healed]]\" from [[Messiah (Handel)|''Messiah'']], HWV 56 (with which Mozart was familiar given his work on [[Der Messias|a German-language version]]) and the [[counter-subject]] comes from the final chorus of the Dettingen Anthem, HWV 265. The first three measures of the [[alto]]s and [[Bass (voice type)|basses]] are shown below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    { \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\tempo Allegro\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 112\n                \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n                R1 r8 e,^\\markup {\\dynamic f} e e f16 g f e f g e f g a g f g a f g a8 bes16 a g f e d cis8\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Chri -- ste e -- le __ _ _ _ }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef bass \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                a4.^\\markup {\\dynamic f} a8 f4 bes cis,4. cis8 d4 r8 d e4. d16 e f8 e16 f g8 f16 g a8\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Ky -- ri -- e  e -- le -- i -- son, e -- le __ _ _ _ }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe contrapuntal motifs of the theme of this fugue include variations on the two themes of the Introit. At first, upward [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] series of sixteenth-notes are replaced by [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] series, which has the effect of augmenting the intensity. This passage shows itself to be a bit demanding in the upper voices, particularly for the soprano voice. A final portion in a slower (Adagio) tempo ends on an \"empty\" fifth, a construction which had during the classical period become archaic, lending the piece an ancient air.\n\n===III. Sequentia===\n====a. Dies irae====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 03. Dies irae.ogg\n|title=Dies irae\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Dies irae opens with a show of orchestral and choral might with [[tremolo]] strings, syncopated figures and repeated chords in the brass. A rising chromatic scurry of sixteenth-notes leads into a chromatically rising harmonic progression with the chorus singing \"''Quantus tremor est futurus''\" (\"what trembling there will be\"  in reference to the [[Last Judgment]]). This material is repeated with harmonic development before the texture suddenly drops to a trembling unison figure with more tremolo strings evocatively painting the \"''Quantus tremor''\" text.\n\n====b. Tuba mirum====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 04. Tuba mirum.ogg\n|title=Tuba mirum\n|description=1960 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\n\nMozart's textual inspiration is again apparent in the Tuba mirum movement, which is introduced with a sequence of three notes in [[arpeggio]], played in B{{music|flat}} major by a solo tenor trombone, unaccompanied, in accordance with the usual German translation of the Latin ''tuba'', ''Posaune'' (trombone). Two measures later, the bass soloist enters, imitating the same theme. At {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 7, there is a [[fermata]], the only point in all the work at which a solo [[cadence (music)|cadence]] occurs. The final quarter notes of the bass soloist herald the arrival of the tenor, followed by the alto and soprano in dramatic fashion.\n\nOn the text ''Cum vix justus sit securus'' (\"When only barely may the just one be secure\"), there is a switch to a [[Homophony|homophonic]] segment sung by the quartet at the same time, articulating, without accompaniment, the ''cum'' and ''vix'' on the \"strong\" (1st and 3rd), then on the \"weak\" (2nd and 4th) beats, with the violins and continuo responding each time; this \"interruption\" (which one may interpret as the interruption preceding the Last Judgment) is heard ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'', ''forte'' and then ''piano'' to bring the movement finally into a crescendo into a [[cadence (music)#Authentic cadence|perfect cadence]].\n\n====c.

Rex tremendae.ogg\n|title=Rex tremendae\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nA descending melody composed of [[dotted note]]s is played by the orchestra to announce the ''Rex tremendae majestatis'' (\"King of tremendous majesty\", i.e., [[God]]), who is called by powerful cries from the choir on the syllable ''Rex'' during the orchestra's pauses. For a surprising effect, the ''Rex'' syllables of the choir fall on the second beats of the measures, even though this is the \"weak\" beat. The choir then adopts the dotted rhythm of the orchestra, forming what Wolff calls [[baroque music]]'s form of \"[[Literary topos|topos]] of the homage to the sovereign\",<ref>[[Christoph Wolff]], ''Mozarts Requiem. Geschichte, Musik, Dokumente. Mit Studienpartitur''. B\u00e4renreiter, Cassel, 1991.

This movement consists of only 22 measures, but this short stretch is rich in variation: homophonic writing and contrapuntal choral passages alternate many times and finish on a quasi-unaccompanied choral cadence, landing on an open D chord (as seen previously in the Kyrie).\n\n====d. Recordare====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 06. Recordare.ogg\n|title=Recordare\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nAt 130 measures, the Recordare is the work's longest movement, as well as the first in [[Triple metre|triple meter]] ({{music|time|3|4}}); the movement is a setting of no fewer than seven stanzas of the ''[[Dies irae]]''. The form of this piece is somewhat similar to [[sonata form]], with an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] around two themes ({{Abbr|mm.|measures}} 1\u201337), a [[Development section|development]] of two themes (mm. 38\u201392) and a [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (mm. 93\u201398).\n\nIn the first 13 measures, the basset horns are the first the present the first theme, clearly inspired by [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'s Sinfonia in D Minor<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mozart's Requiem: Historical and Analytical Studies, Documents, Score|last=Wolff|first=Christoph|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0520213890|location=|pages=80\u201382|translator-last=Whittal|translator-first=Mary}}</ref>, the theme is enriched by a magnificent counterpoint by cellos in descending scales that are reprised throughout the movement. This counterpoint of the first theme prolongs the orchestral introduction with chords, recalling the beginning of the work and its rhythmic and melodic shiftings (the first basset horn begins a measure after the second but a tone higher, the first violins are likewise in sync with the second violins but a quarter note shifted, etc.). The introduction is followed by the vocal soloists; their first theme is sung by the alto and bass (from {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 14), followed by the soprano and tenor (from m. 20). Each time, the theme concludes with a [[hemiola]] (mm. 18\u201319 and 24\u201325). The second theme arrives on ''Ne me perdas'', in which the accompaniment contrasts with that of the first theme. Instead of descending scales, the accompaniment is limited to repeated chords. This exposition concludes with four orchestral measures based on the [[counter-melody]] of the first theme (mm. 34\u201337).\n\nThe development of these two themes begins in {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 38 on ''Quaerens me''; the second theme is not recognizable except by the structure of its accompaniment. At m. 46, it is the first theme that is developed beginning from ''Tantus labor'' and concludes with two measures of hemiola at mm. 50\u201351. After two orchestral bars (mm. 52\u201353), the first theme is heard again on the text ''Juste Judex'' and ends on a hemiola in mm. 66\u201367. Then, the second theme is reused on ''ante diem rationis''; after the four measures of orchestra from 68 to 71, the first theme is developed alone.\n\nThe recapitulation intervenes in {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 93. The initial structure reproduces itself with the first theme on the text ''Preces meae'' and then in m. 99 on ''Sed tu bonus''. The second theme reappears one final time on m. 106 on ''Sed tu bonus'' and concludes with three hemiolas. The final measures of the movement recede to simple orchestral descending contrapuntal scales.\n\n====e. Confutatis====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A.

Confutatis.ogg\n|title=Confutatis\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Confutatis begins with a rhythmic and dynamic sequence of strong contrasts and surprising harmonic turns. Accompanied by the [[Basso Continuo|basso continuo]], the male choristers burst into a ''forte'' vision of the infernal, on a dotted rhythm. The accompaniment then ceases alongside the male voices, and the female voices enter softly and ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'', singing ''Voca me cum benedictis'' (\"Call upon me with the blessed\") with an [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] accompaniment in strings.\n\nFinally, in the following stanza (''Oro supplex et acclinis''), there is a striking [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] from A minor to A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    { << \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #25\n            \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 4/4\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 8 = 140\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 4/4\n                a4 r r2 r a4^\\markup {\\dynamic p} a bes bes bes bes bes( aes2 g4) aes\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { ctis.

Then, after two measures, the sopranos begin a [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] progression, in disjointed eighth-notes on the text ''resurget'' (\"will be reborn\"), then ''[[legato]]'' and [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] on a powerful [[crescendo]]. The choir is ''forte'' by {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 8, at which point Mozart's contribution to the movement is interrupted by his death.\n\nS\u00fcssmayr brings the choir to a reference of the Introit and ends on an ''[[Amen]]'' cadence. Discovery of a fragmentary ''Amen'' fugue in Mozart's hand has led to speculation that it may have been intended for the Requiem. Indeed, many [[Modern completions of Mozart's Requiem|modern completions]] (such as [[Robert D. Levin|Levin's]]) complete Mozart's fragment. Some sections of this movement are quoted in the Requiem mass of [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]], who was a great admirer of Mozart. Ray Robinson, the music scholar and president (from 1969 to 1987) of the [[Westminster Choir College]], suggests that S\u00fcssmayr used materials from Credo of one of Mozart's earlier masses, [[Mass in C major, K. 220 \"Sparrow\"]] in completing this movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/2020d7f67ddde859d52b443e8616b108/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1821226|title=A New Mozart \"Requiem\" - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> \n\n=== IV.

Domine Jesu.ogg\n|title=Domine Jesu\n|description=20th Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe first movement of the Offertorium, the Domine Jesu, begins on a ''piano'' theme consisting of an ascending progression on a G minor [[triad (music)|triad]]. This theme will later be varied in various keys, before returning to G minor when the four soloists enter a [[Canon (music)|canon]] on ''Sed signifer [[Michael (archangel)|sanctus Michael]]'', switching between minor (in ascent) and major (in descent). Between these thematic passages are ''forte'' phrases where the choir enters, often in unison and dotted rhythm, such as on ''Rex gloriae'' (\"King of glory\") or ''de ore leonis'' (\"[Deliver them] from the mouth of the lion\"). Two choral fugues follow, on ''ne absorbeat eas tartarus, ne cadant in obscurum'' (\"may [[Tartarus]] not absorb them, nor may they fall into darkness\") and ''Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius'' (\"What once to Abraham you promised and to his seed\").

After 20 measures, the movement switches to an alternation of ''forte'' and ''piano'' exclamations of the choir, while progressing from B{{music|flat}} major towards B{{music|flat}} minor, then F major, D{{music|flat}} major, A{{music|flat}} major, F minor, C minor and E{{music|flat}} major. An overtaking chromatic melody on ''Fac eas, Domine, de morte transire ad vitam'' (\"Make them, O Lord, cross over from death to life\") finally carries the movement into the dominant of G minor, followed by a reprise of the ''Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius'' fugue.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    { << \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #46\n            \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 78\n                \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n                bes2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} b2 b4 c4. c8 d d es2.~ es4 d c bes bes bes bes2. a4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                es2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} f2 f4 es4. es8 g g g4 fis g a2.~ a4 g g g2. fis4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef \"treble_8\" \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                g2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} aes2 aes4 g4. g8 g g c2.~ c4 a d d g, d' e2. a,4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef bass \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c {\n                es2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} d2 d4 es4. es8 b b c4( aes' g) fis2 fis4 g es d cis2. d4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }            >>\n    >>\n>> }\n</score>\n\nThe words \"Quam olim da capo\" are likely to have been the last Mozart wrote; this portion of the manuscript has been missing since [[Requiem (Mozart)#Autograph at the 1958 World's Fair|it was stolen at 1958 World's Fair]] in [[Brussels]] by a person whose identity remains unknown.\n\n===S\u00fcssmayr's additions===\n====V.

Sanctus.ogg\n|title=Sanctus\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Sanctus is the first movement written entirely by S\u00fcssmayr, and the only movement of the Requiem to have a key signature with sharps: D major, generally used for the entry of trumpets in the Baroque era. After a succinct glorification of the Lord follows a short [[fugue]] in {{music|time|3|4}} on ''[[Hosanna]] in excelsis'' (\"Glory [to God] in the highest\"), noted for its [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythm, and for its motivic similarity to the ''Quam olim Abrahae'' fugue.\n\n====VI. Benedictus====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 12. Benedictus.ogg\n|title=Benedictus\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Benedictus, a quartet, adopts the key of the [[submediant]], B{{music|flat}} major (which can also be considered the [[Relative key|relative]] of the [[subdominant]] of the key of D minor). The Sanctus's ending on a D major [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] necessitates a mediant jump to this new key.\n\nThe Benedictus is constructed on three types of [[Phrase (music theory)|phrases]]: the (A) theme, which is first presented by the orchestra and reprised from {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 4 by the alto and from m. 6 by the soprano. The word ''benedictus'' is held, which stands in opposition with the (B) phrase, which is first seen at m. 10, also on the word ''benedictus'' but with a quick and chopped-up rhythm. The phrase develops and rebounds at m. 15 with a [[broken cadence]]. The third phrase, (C), is a solemn ringing where the winds respond to the chords with a staggering harmony, as shown in a Mozartian cadence at mm. 21 and 22, where the [[counterpoint]] of the basset horns mixes with the line of the cello. The rest of the movement consists of variations on this writing. At m. 23, phrase (A) is reprised on a F [[Pedal point|pedal]] and introduces a recapitulation of the primary theme from the bass and tenor from mm. 28 and 30, respectively. Phrase (B) follows at m. 33, although without the broken cadence, then repeats at m. 38 with the broken cadence once more. This carries the movement to a new Mozartian cadence in mm. 47 to 49 and concludes on phrase (C), which reintroduces the ''Hosanna'' fugue from the Sanctus movement, in the new key of the Benedictus.\n\n====VII.

S\u00fcssmayr borrowed some of Eybler's work in making his completion, and added his own orchestration to the movements from the Kyrie onward, completed the Lacrymosa, and added several new movements which a Requiem would normally comprise: Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei. He then added a final section, Lux aeterna by adapting the opening two movements which Mozart had written to the different words which finish the Requiem mass, which according to both S\u00fcssmayr and Mozart's wife was done according to Mozart's directions. Some people{{Who|date=February 2018}} consider it unlikely, however, that Mozart would have repeated the opening two sections if he had survived to finish the work.\n\nOther composers may have helped S\u00fcssmayr.

The various complete and incomplete manuscripts eventually turned up in the 19th century, but many of the figures involved left ambiguous statements on record as to how they were involved in the affair. Despite the controversy over how much of the music is actually Mozart's, the commonly performed S\u00fcssmayr version has become widely accepted by the public. This acceptance is quite strong, even when alternative completions provide logical and compelling solutions for the work.\n[[File:Costanze Mozart by Hanson 1802.jpg|left|thumb|Constanze in 1802, portrait by [[Hans Hansen (portrait painter)|Hans Hansen]]]]\n\n=== Promotion by Constanze Mozart ===\nThe confusion surrounding the circumstances of the Requiem's composition was created in a large part by Mozart's wife, Constanze. Constanze had a difficult task in front of her: she had to keep secret the fact that the Requiem was unfinished at Mozart's death, so she could collect the final payment from the commission. For a period of time, she also needed to keep secret the fact that S\u00fcssmayr had anything to do with the composition of the Requiem at all, in order to allow Count Walsegg the impression that Mozart wrote the work entirely himself. Once she received the commission, she needed to carefully promote the work as Mozart's so that she could continue to receive revenue from the work's publication and performance. During this phase of the Requiem's history, it was still important that the public accept that Mozart wrote the whole piece, as it would fetch larger sums from publishers and the public if it were completely by Mozart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Paul|date=1989|title=Mozart's Requiem; A Revaluation of the Evidence|url=|journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association|volume=114|issue=2|at=p. 211|jstor=766531|doi=10.1093/jrma/114.2.203}}</ref>\n\nIt is Constanze's efforts that created the flurry of half-truths and myths almost instantly after Mozart's death. According to Constanze, Mozart declared that he was composing the Requiem for himself and that he had been poisoned. His symptoms worsened, and he began to complain about the painful swelling of his body and high fever. Nevertheless, Mozart continued his work on the Requiem, and even on the last day of his life, he was explaining to his assistant how he intended to finish the Requiem.\n\nWith multiple levels of deception surrounding the Requiem's completion, a natural outcome is the mythologizing which subsequently occurred. One series of myths surrounding the Requiem involves the role [[Antonio Salieri]] played in the commissioning and completion of the Requiem (and in Mozart's death generally). While the most recent retelling of this myth is [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' and the [[Amadeus (film)|movie]] made from it, it is important to note that the source of misinformation was actually a 19th-century play by [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', which was turned into an opera by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and subsequently used as the framework for ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]''.<ref>Gregory Allen Robbins.

For example, at least three of the conflicting sources, all dated within two decades following Mozart's death, cite Constanze as their primary source of interview information.\n\n==== Friedrich Rochlitz ====\nIn 1798, [[Friedrich Rochlitz]], a German biographical author and amateur composer, published a set of Mozart anecdotes that he claimed to have collected during his meeting with Constanze in 1796.<ref name=\"Landon\">{{Cite book\n |last=Landon\n |first=H.

Schirmer|Schirmer Books]]\n |year=1988\n}}</ref> The Rochlitz publication makes the following statements:\n* Mozart was unaware of his commissioner's identity at the time he accepted the project.\n* He was not bound to any date of completion of the work.\n* He stated that it would take him around four weeks to complete.\n* He requested, and received, 100 ducats at the time of the first commissioning message.\n* He began the project immediately after receiving the commission.\n* His health was poor from the outset; he fainted multiple times while working.\n* He took a break from writing the work to visit the [[Prater]] with his wife.\n* He shared the thought with his wife that he was writing this piece for his own funeral.\n* He spoke of \"very strange thoughts\" regarding the unpredicted appearance and commission of this unknown man.\n* He noted that the departure of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] to Prague for the coronation was approaching.\n\nThe most highly disputed of these claims is the last one, the chronology of this setting. According to Rochlitz, the messenger arrives quite some time before the departure of Leopold for the coronation, yet there is a record of his departure occurring in mid-July 1791. However, as Constanze was in [[Baden bei Wien|Baden]] during all of June to mid-July, she would not have been present for the commission or the drive they were said to have taken together.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> Furthermore, ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (except for the Overture and March of the Priests) was completed by mid-July. ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' was commissioned by mid-July.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> There was no time for Mozart to work on the Requiem on the large scale indicated by the Rochlitz publication in the time frame provided.\n\n==== Franz Xaver Niemetschek ====\n[[File:Requiem6.png|thumb|1857 [[Lithography|lithograph]] by Franz Schramm, titled ''Ein Moment aus den letzten Tagen Mozarts'' (\"Moment from the Last Days of Mozart\").

He published his biography in 1808, containing a number of claims about Mozart's receipt of the Requiem commission:\n* Mozart received the commission very shortly before the Coronation of Emperor Leopold II and before he received the commission to go to Prague.\n* He did not accept the messenger's request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.\n* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work's completion.\n* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.\n* He fell ill while writing the work\n* He told Constanze \"I am only too conscious... my end will not be long in coming: for sure, someone has poisoned me! I cannot rid my mind of this thought.\"\n* Constanze thought that the Requiem was overstraining him; she called the doctor and took away the score.\n* On the day of his death, he had the score brought to his bed.\n* The messenger took the unfinished Requiem soon after Mozart's death.\n* Constanze never learned the commissioner's name.\n\nThis account, too, has fallen under scrutiny and criticism of its accuracy. According to letters, Constanze most certainly knew the name of the commissioner by the time this interview was released in 1800.<ref name=\"Boerner\" /> Additionally, the Requiem was not given to the messenger until some time after Mozart's death.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> This interview contains the only account from Constanze herself of the claim that she took the Requiem away from Wolfgang for a significant duration during his composition of it.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> Otherwise, the timeline provided in this account is historically probable.\n\n==== Georg Nikolaus von Nissen ====\nHowever, the most highly accepted text attributed to Constanze is the interview to her second husband, [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen]].<ref name=\"Landon\" /> After Nissen's death in 1826, Constanze released the biography of Wolfgang (1828) that Nissen had compiled, which included this interview. Nissen states:\n* Mozart received the commission shortly before the coronation of Emperor Leopold and before he received the commission to go to Prague.\n* He did not accept the messenger's request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.\n* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work's completion.\n* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.\n\nThe Nissen publication lacks information following Mozart's return from Prague.<ref name=\"Landon\" />\n\n== Influences ==\n[[File:Michaelhaydn1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Haydn]] (younger brother of [[Joseph Haydn]]), whose own [[Requiem (Michael Haydn)|Requiem]] influenced Mozart]]\nMozart esteemed [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in 1789 he was commissioned by Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]] to rearrange ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' ([[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 56).

Another influence was [[Michael Haydn]]'s [[Requiem (Michael Haydn)|Requiem in C minor]] which he and his father heard at the first three performances in January 1772. Some have noted that Michael Haydn's Introitus sounds rather similar to Mozart's, and the theme for Mozart's \"Quam olim Abrahae\" fugue is a direct quote of the theme from Haydn's Offertorium and Versus. In Introitus m. 21, the soprano sings \"Te decet hymnus Deus in Zion\". It is quoting the Lutheran hymn {{lang|de|[[Meine Seele erhebet den Herren]]}}. The melody is used by many composers e.g. in Bach's cantata [[Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10|''Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'', BWV 10]] but also in Michael Haydn's Requiem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/507126/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart-Requiem-in-D-Minor-Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Meine-Seel-Erhebt-Den-Herren/|title=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 'Requiem in D Minor'|website=WhoSampled.com|publisher=Discover the Sample Source|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem \"Mozart's Requiem\" was first published in ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' in 1828.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timeline of Mozart's Requiem}}\n\n== Modern completions ==\n{{Main|Modern completions of Mozart's Requiem}}\n\nIn the 1960s, a sketch for an Amen [[Fugue]] was discovered, which some musicologists (Levin, Maunder) believe belongs to the Requiem at the conclusion of the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]] after the Lacrymosa. [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] argues that this Amen fugue was not intended for the Requiem, rather that it \"may have been for a separate unfinished mass in D minor\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} to which the [[Kyrie in D minor, K. 341|Kyrie K.&nbsp;341]] also belonged.\n\nThere is, however, compelling evidence placing the Amen Fugue in the Requiem<ref>Paul Moseley: \"Mozart's Requiem: A Revaluation of the Evidence\" ''J Royal Music Assn'' (1989; 114) pp. 203\u2013237</ref> based on current Mozart scholarship. First, the principal [[Subject (music)|subject]] is the main theme of the Requiem (stated at the beginning, and throughout the work) in strict [[Melodic inversion|inversion]]. Second, it is found on the same page as a sketch for the Rex tremendae (together with a sketch for the overture of his last opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''), and thus surely dates from late 1791. The only place where the word 'Amen' occurs in anything that Mozart wrote in late 1791 is in the sequence of the Requiem. Third, as Levin points out in the foreword to his completion of the Requiem, the addition of the Amen Fugue at the end of the sequence results in an overall design that ends each large section with a fugue.\n\nSince the 1970s several composers and musicologists, dissatisfied with the traditional \"S\u00fcssmayr\" completion, have attempted alternative completions of the Requiem.\n\n==Autograph at the 1958 World's Fair==<!--Linked from [[Expo 58]]-->\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizonal\n|width=175\n|image1=Mozart K626 Arbeitspartitur last page.jpg\n|caption1=Mozart's manuscript with missing corner\n|image2=Quam olim dc in Mozart's hand.png\n|caption2=\"quam olim d: c\" in Mozart's hand\n}}\nThe autograph of the Requiem was placed on display at the [[Expo 58|World's Fair in 1958]] in Brussels. At some point during the fair, someone was able to gain access to the manuscript, tearing off the bottom right-hand corner of the second to last page (folio 99r/45r), containing the words \"Quam olim d: C:\" (an instruction that the \"Quam olim\" fugue of the ''Domine Jesu'' was to be repeated [[da capo]], at the end of the Hostias). The perpetrator has not been identified and the fragment has not been recovered.<ref>[http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/requiem/galerie3.htm Facsimile of the manuscript's last page, showing the missing corner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113030907/http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/requiem/galerie3.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}</ref>\n\nIf the most common authorship theory is true, then \"Quam olim d: C:\" might very well be the last words Mozart wrote before he died.

The keyboard arrangements notably demonstrate the variety of approaches taken to translating the Requiem, particularly the Confutatis and Lacrimosa movements, in order to balance preserving the Requiem's character while also being physically playable. [[Karl Klindworth]]'s piano solo (c.1900), [[Muzio Clementi]]'s organ solo, and [[Renaud de Vilbac]]'s harmonium solo (c.1875) are liberal in their approach to achieve this. In contrast, [[Carl Czerny]] wrote his piano transcription for two players, enabling him to retain the extent of the score, if sacrificing timbral character. [[Franz Liszt]]'s piano solo (c.1865) departs the most in terms of fidelity and character of the Requiem, through its inclusion of composition devices used to showcase pianistic technique.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| author=C.

Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791, but it was unfinished at [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his death]] on 5 December the same year. A completed version dated 1792 by [[Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr]] was delivered to Count [[Franz von Walsegg]], who commissioned the piece for a Requiem service to commemorate the anniversary of his wife's death on 14 February.\n\nThe autograph manuscript shows the finished and [[Orchestration|orchestrated]] [[Introit]] in Mozart's hand, and detailed drafts of the [[Kyrie]] and the [[sequence (musical form)|sequence]] [[Dies irae]] as far as the first eight bars of the ''[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]'' [[Movement (music)|movement]], and the [[Offertory]]. It cannot be shown to what extent S\u00fcssmayr may have depended on now lost \"scraps of paper\" for the remainder; he later claimed the [[Sanctus|Sanctus and Benedictus]] and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]] as his own.\n\nWalsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition, as he is known to have done with other works. This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart's widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]]. She was responsible for a number of stories surrounding the composition of the work, including the claims that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious messenger who did not reveal the commissioner's identity, and that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the requiem for his own funeral.\n\nIn addition to the S\u00fcssmayr version, a number of alternative completions have been developed by musicologists in the 20th century.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe Requiem is scored for 2 [[basset horn]]s in F, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[trumpet]]s in D, 3 [[trombone]]s ([[Alto trombone|alto]], [[Tenor trombone|tenor]], and [[Bass Trombone|bass]]), [[timpani]] (2 drums), [[violin]]s, [[viola]], and [[basso continuo]] ([[cello]], [[double bass]], and [[Pipe organ|organ]]). The basset horn parts are sometimes played on conventional [[clarinet]]s, even though this changes the sonority.\n\nThe vocal forces consist of [[soprano]], [[contralto]], [[tenor]], and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] soloists and an [[SATB]] mixed [[choir]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:K626 Requiem Mozart.jpg|thumb|325x325px|The first page of Mozart's autograph score]]\nS\u00fcssmayr's completion divides the [[Requiem]] into eight sections:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|'''[[Introit]]us'''}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha|Requiem aeternam}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=2\n|'''[[Kyrie]]'''\n|'''[[Sequence (musical form)|Sequentia]]''' (text based on sections of the [[Dies irae]])\n}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|[[Dies irae]]|Tuba mirum|Rex tremendae\n|Recordare|Confutatis|[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=4|'''[[Offertory|Offertorium]]'''}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|Domine Jesu\n|Hostias}}\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman|start=5\n|'''[[Sanctus]]'''\n|'''Benedictus''' \n|'''[[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]'''|'''[[Communion (chant)|Communio]]'''\n}}\n:{{Ordered list|type=lower-alpha|Lux aeterna|Cum sanctis tuis}}\n\nAll sections from the Sanctus onwards are not present in Mozart's manuscript fragment.

[[Bruno Walter]]; [[Wiener Philharmoniker]]; Wiener Staatsopernchor; [[Lisa della Casa]], soprano; [[Ira Malaniuk]], alto; [[Anton Dermota]], tenor; [[Cesare Siepi]], bass.}}\nThe Requiem begins with a seven-measure instrumental [[Introduction (music)|introduction]], in which the woodwinds (first bassoons, then basset horns) present the principal [[Theme (music)|theme]] of the work in [[imitative counterpoint]]. The first five measures of this passage (without the accompaniment) are shown below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    { \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\tempo Adagio\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"clarinet\"\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 46\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n                s1 s1 r2 r4 d^\\p^~ d cis d e f2 e4 c^~ c4\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemDown\n                R1 r4 a2\\p_( gis4) a_( b c) bes8 a bes4 a8 g a4 b c8 b16 a g2 a8_( g) f2\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"bassoon\"\n            \\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn\n            \\mergeDifferentlyDottedOn\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key d \\minor \\time 4/4\n                r4 d2^\\markup {\\dynamic p}( cis4) d( e f2) e2.( fis4) g f!8 e f4 b,8^( e^~ e8 d16 c d4 e2^~) e4\n\n                }\n\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown\n                s1 s1 s1 r4 a2\\p_( gis4 a b c2) a4\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThis theme is modeled after [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[The Ways of Zion Do Mourn / Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline|The ways of Zion do mourn]]'', HWV 264. Many parts of the work make reference to this passage, notably in the [[coloratura]] in the Kyrie [[fugue]] and in the conclusion of the Lacrimosa.\n\nThe trombones then announce the entry of the choir, which breaks into the theme, with the basses alone for the first measure, followed by imitation by the other parts. The chords play off [[Syncopation|syncopated]] and staggered structures in the accompaniment, thus underlining the solemn and steady nature of the music. A soprano solo is sung to the ''Te decet hymnus'' text in the [[Reciting tone#tonus peregrinus|tonus peregrinus]] (also known as the 9th Gregorian mode). The choir follows along on the same motifs. Then, the principal theme is treated by the choir and the orchestra in downward-gliding sixteenth-notes. The courses of the melodies, whether held up or moving down, change and interlace amongst themselves, while passages in [[counterpoint]] and in unison (e.g., ''Et lux perpetua'') alternate; all this creates the charm of this movement, which finishes with a [[Cadence (music)#Half cadence|half cadence]] on the [[dominant (music)|dominant]].\n\n===II. Kyrie===\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 02. Kyrie eleison.ogg\n|title=Kyrie\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Kyrie follows without pause (''attacca''). It is a [[double fugue]] also on a Handelian theme: the [[Subject (music)|subject]] is based on \"[[Messiah Part II#25|And with his stripes we are healed]]\" from [[Messiah (Handel)|''Messiah'']], HWV 56 (with which Mozart was familiar given his work on [[Der Messias|a German-language version]]) and the [[counter-subject]] comes from the final chorus of the Dettingen Anthem, HWV 265.

At first, upward [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] series of sixteenth-notes are replaced by [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] series, which has the effect of augmenting the intensity. This passage shows itself to be a bit demanding in the upper voices, particularly for the soprano voice. A final portion in a slower (Adagio) tempo ends on an \"empty\" fifth, a construction which had during the classical period become archaic, lending the piece an ancient air.\n\n===III. Sequentia===\n====a. Dies irae====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 03. Dies irae.ogg\n|title=Dies irae\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Dies irae opens with a show of orchestral and choral might with [[tremolo]] strings, syncopated figures and repeated chords in the brass. A rising chromatic scurry of sixteenth-notes leads into a chromatically rising harmonic progression with the chorus singing \"''Quantus tremor est futurus''\" (\"what trembling there will be\"  in reference to the [[Last Judgment]]). This material is repeated with harmonic development before the texture suddenly drops to a trembling unison figure with more tremolo strings evocatively painting the \"''Quantus tremor''\" text.\n\n====b. Tuba mirum====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 04. Tuba mirum.ogg\n|title=Tuba mirum\n|description=1960 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\n\nMozart's textual inspiration is again apparent in the Tuba mirum movement, which is introduced with a sequence of three notes in [[arpeggio]], played in B{{music|flat}} major by a solo tenor trombone, unaccompanied, in accordance with the usual German translation of the Latin ''tuba'', ''Posaune'' (trombone). Two measures later, the bass soloist enters, imitating the same theme. At {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 7, there is a [[fermata]], the only point in all the work at which a solo [[cadence (music)|cadence]] occurs. The final quarter notes of the bass soloist herald the arrival of the tenor, followed by the alto and soprano in dramatic fashion.\n\nOn the text ''Cum vix justus sit securus'' (\"When only barely may the just one be secure\"), there is a switch to a [[Homophony|homophonic]] segment sung by the quartet at the same time, articulating, without accompaniment, the ''cum'' and ''vix'' on the \"strong\" (1st and 3rd), then on the \"weak\" (2nd and 4th) beats, with the violins and continuo responding each time; this \"interruption\" (which one may interpret as the interruption preceding the Last Judgment) is heard ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'', ''forte'' and then ''piano'' to bring the movement finally into a crescendo into a [[cadence (music)#Authentic cadence|perfect cadence]].\n\n====c. Rex tremendae====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 05. Rex tremendae.ogg\n|title=Rex tremendae\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nA descending melody composed of [[dotted note]]s is played by the orchestra to announce the ''Rex tremendae majestatis'' (\"King of tremendous majesty\", i.e., [[God]]), who is called by powerful cries from the choir on the syllable ''Rex'' during the orchestra's pauses. For a surprising effect, the ''Rex'' syllables of the choir fall on the second beats of the measures, even though this is the \"weak\" beat. The choir then adopts the dotted rhythm of the orchestra, forming what Wolff calls [[baroque music]]'s form of \"[[Literary topos|topos]] of the homage to the sovereign\",<ref>[[Christoph Wolff]], ''Mozarts Requiem. Geschichte, Musik, Dokumente. Mit Studienpartitur''. B\u00e4renreiter, Cassel, 1991. (4th edition, edited), 2003 {{ISBN|3-7618-1242-6}}</ref> or, more simply put, that this musical style is a standard form of salute to royalty, or, in this case, divinity. This movement consists of only 22 measures, but this short stretch is rich in variation: homophonic writing and contrapuntal choral passages alternate many times and finish on a quasi-unaccompanied choral cadence, landing on an open D chord (as seen previously in the Kyrie).\n\n====d. Recordare====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 06. Recordare.ogg\n|title=Recordare\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nAt 130 measures, the Recordare is the work's longest movement, as well as the first in [[Triple metre|triple meter]] ({{music|time|3|4}}); the movement is a setting of no fewer than seven stanzas of the ''[[Dies irae]]''. The form of this piece is somewhat similar to [[sonata form]], with an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] around two themes ({{Abbr|mm.|measures}} 1\u201337), a [[Development section|development]] of two themes (mm. 38\u201392) and a [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (mm. 93\u201398).\n\nIn the first 13 measures, the basset horns are the first the present the first theme, clearly inspired by [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'s Sinfonia in D Minor<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mozart's Requiem: Historical and Analytical Studies, Documents, Score|last=Wolff|first=Christoph|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0520213890|location=|pages=80\u201382|translator-last=Whittal|translator-first=Mary}}</ref>, the theme is enriched by a magnificent counterpoint by cellos in descending scales that are reprised throughout the movement. This counterpoint of the first theme prolongs the orchestral introduction with chords, recalling the beginning of the work and its rhythmic and melodic shiftings (the first basset horn begins a measure after the second but a tone higher, the first violins are likewise in sync with the second violins but a quarter note shifted, etc.). The introduction is followed by the vocal soloists; their first theme is sung by the alto and bass (from {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 14), followed by the soprano and tenor (from m. 20). Each time, the theme concludes with a [[hemiola]] (mm. 18\u201319 and 24\u201325). The second theme arrives on ''Ne me perdas'', in which the accompaniment contrasts with that of the first theme. Instead of descending scales, the accompaniment is limited to repeated chords. This exposition concludes with four orchestral measures based on the [[counter-melody]] of the first theme (mm. 34\u201337).\n\nThe development of these two themes begins in {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 38 on ''Quaerens me''; the second theme is not recognizable except by the structure of its accompaniment. At m. 46, it is the first theme that is developed beginning from ''Tantus labor'' and concludes with two measures of hemiola at mm. 50\u201351. After two orchestral bars (mm. 52\u201353), the first theme is heard again on the text ''Juste Judex'' and ends on a hemiola in mm. 66\u201367. Then, the second theme is reused on ''ante diem rationis''; after the four measures of orchestra from 68 to 71, the first theme is developed alone.\n\nThe recapitulation intervenes in {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 93. The initial structure reproduces itself with the first theme on the text ''Preces meae'' and then in m. 99 on ''Sed tu bonus''. The second theme reappears one final time on m. 106 on ''Sed tu bonus'' and concludes with three hemiolas. The final measures of the movement recede to simple orchestral descending contrapuntal scales.\n\n====e. Confutatis====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 07. Confutatis.ogg\n|title=Confutatis\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Confutatis begins with a rhythmic and dynamic sequence of strong contrasts and surprising harmonic turns. Accompanied by the [[Basso Continuo|basso continuo]], the male choristers burst into a ''forte'' vision of the infernal, on a dotted rhythm. The accompaniment then ceases alongside the male voices, and the female voices enter softly and ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'', singing ''Voca me cum benedictis'' (\"Call upon me with the blessed\") with an [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] accompaniment in strings.\n\nFinally, in the following stanza (''Oro supplex et acclinis''), there is a striking [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] from A minor to A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    { << \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #25\n            \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 4/4\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 8 = 140\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 4/4\n                a4 r r2 r a4^\\markup {\\dynamic p} a bes bes bes bes bes( aes2 g4) aes\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { ctis.

A final seventh chord carries us to the Lacrimosa.\n\n==== f.

Then, after two measures, the sopranos begin a [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] progression, in disjointed eighth-notes on the text ''resurget'' (\"will be reborn\"), then ''[[legato]]'' and [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] on a powerful [[crescendo]]. The choir is ''forte'' by {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 8, at which point Mozart's contribution to the movement is interrupted by his death.\n\nS\u00fcssmayr brings the choir to a reference of the Introit and ends on an ''[[Amen]]'' cadence. Discovery of a fragmentary ''Amen'' fugue in Mozart's hand has led to speculation that it may have been intended for the Requiem. Indeed, many [[Modern completions of Mozart's Requiem|modern completions]] (such as [[Robert D. Levin|Levin's]]) complete Mozart's fragment. Some sections of this movement are quoted in the Requiem mass of [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]], who was a great admirer of Mozart. Ray Robinson, the music scholar and president (from 1969 to 1987) of the [[Westminster Choir College]], suggests that S\u00fcssmayr used materials from Credo of one of Mozart's earlier masses, [[Mass in C major, K. 220 \"Sparrow\"]] in completing this movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/2020d7f67ddde859d52b443e8616b108/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1821226|title=A New Mozart \"Requiem\" - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> \n\n=== IV.

Domine Jesu.ogg\n|title=Domine Jesu\n|description=20th Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe first movement of the Offertorium, the Domine Jesu, begins on a ''piano'' theme consisting of an ascending progression on a G minor [[triad (music)|triad]]. This theme will later be varied in various keys, before returning to G minor when the four soloists enter a [[Canon (music)|canon]] on ''Sed signifer [[Michael (archangel)|sanctus Michael]]'', switching between minor (in ascent) and major (in descent). Between these thematic passages are ''forte'' phrases where the choir enters, often in unison and dotted rhythm, such as on ''Rex gloriae'' (\"King of glory\") or ''de ore leonis'' (\"[Deliver them] from the mouth of the lion\"). Two choral fugues follow, on ''ne absorbeat eas tartarus, ne cadant in obscurum'' (\"may [[Tartarus]] not absorb them, nor may they fall into darkness\") and ''Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius'' (\"What once to Abraham you promised and to his seed\").

After 20 measures, the movement switches to an alternation of ''forte'' and ''piano'' exclamations of the choir, while progressing from B{{music|flat}} major towards B{{music|flat}} minor, then F major, D{{music|flat}} major, A{{music|flat}} major, F minor, C minor and E{{music|flat}} major. An overtaking chromatic melody on ''Fac eas, Domine, de morte transire ad vitam'' (\"Make them, O Lord, cross over from death to life\") finally carries the movement into the dominant of G minor, followed by a reprise of the ''Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius'' fugue.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    { << \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #46\n            \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 78\n                \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n                bes2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} b2 b4 c4. c8 d d es2.~ es4 d c bes bes bes bes2. a4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef treble \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                es2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} f2 f4 es4. es8 g g g4 fis g a2.~ a4 g g g2. fis4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef \"treble_8\" \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                g2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} aes2 aes4 g4. g8 g g c2.~ c4 a d d g, d' e2. a,4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"voice oohs\"\n            \\clef bass \\key es \\major \\time 3/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c {\n                es2.^\\markup {\\dynamic p} d2 d4 es4. es8 b b c4( aes' g) fis2 fis4 g es d cis2. d4\n                }\n            \\addlyrics { Fac e -- as, Do -- mi -- ne, de -- mor -- te trans -- i -- re ad vi -- tam, }            >>\n    >>\n>> }\n</score>\n\nThe words \"Quam olim da capo\" are likely to have been the last Mozart wrote; this portion of the manuscript has been missing since [[Requiem (Mozart)#Autograph at the 1958 World's Fair|it was stolen at 1958 World's Fair]] in [[Brussels]] by a person whose identity remains unknown.\n\n===S\u00fcssmayr's additions===\n====V.

Sanctus.ogg\n|title=Sanctus\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Sanctus is the first movement written entirely by S\u00fcssmayr, and the only movement of the Requiem to have a key signature with sharps: D major, generally used for the entry of trumpets in the Baroque era. After a succinct glorification of the Lord follows a short [[fugue]] in {{music|time|3|4}} on ''[[Hosanna]] in excelsis'' (\"Glory [to God] in the highest\"), noted for its [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythm, and for its motivic similarity to the ''Quam olim Abrahae'' fugue.\n\n====VI. Benedictus====\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W. A. Mozart - Requiem, K. 626 (Bruno Walter, Wiener Philharmoniker, Wiener Staatsopernchor, 1956) - 12. Benedictus.ogg\n|title=Benedictus\n|description=1956 Salzburg Festival performance (see above)}}\nThe Benedictus, a quartet, adopts the key of the [[submediant]], B{{music|flat}} major (which can also be considered the [[Relative key|relative]] of the [[subdominant]] of the key of D minor). The Sanctus's ending on a D major [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] necessitates a mediant jump to this new key.\n\nThe Benedictus is constructed on three types of [[Phrase (music theory)|phrases]]: the (A) theme, which is first presented by the orchestra and reprised from {{Abbr|m.|measure}} 4 by the alto and from m. 6 by the soprano. The word ''benedictus'' is held, which stands in opposition with the (B) phrase, which is first seen at m. 10, also on the word ''benedictus'' but with a quick and chopped-up rhythm. The phrase develops and rebounds at m. 15 with a [[broken cadence]]. The third phrase, (C), is a solemn ringing where the winds respond to the chords with a staggering harmony, as shown in a Mozartian cadence at mm. 21 and 22, where the [[counterpoint]] of the basset horns mixes with the line of the cello. The rest of the movement consists of variations on this writing. At m. 23, phrase (A) is reprised on a F [[Pedal point|pedal]] and introduces a recapitulation of the primary theme from the bass and tenor from mm. 28 and 30, respectively. Phrase (B) follows at m. 33, although without the broken cadence, then repeats at m. 38 with the broken cadence once more. This carries the movement to a new Mozartian cadence in mm. 47 to 49 and concludes on phrase (C), which reintroduces the ''Hosanna'' fugue from the Sanctus movement, in the new key of the Benedictus.\n\n====VII.

The Sequence and Offertorium were completed in skeleton, with the exception of the Lacrimosa, which breaks off after the first eight bars. The vocal parts and [[Basso Continuo|continuo]] were fully notated. Occasionally, some of the prominent orchestral parts were briefly indicated, such as the first violin part of the Rex tremendae and Confutatis, the musical bridges in the Recordare, and the trombone solos of the Tuba Mirum.\n\nWhat remained to be completed for these sections were mostly accompanimental figures, inner harmonies, and orchestral doublings to the vocal parts.\n\n=== Completion by Mozart's contemporaries ===\nThe eccentric count [[Franz von Walsegg]] commissioned the Requiem from Mozart anonymously through intermediaries.

Mozart received only half of the payment in advance, so upon his death his widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] was keen to have the work completed secretly by someone else, submit it to the count as having been completed by Mozart and collect the final payment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Christoph|authorlink=Christoph Wolff|title=Mozart's Requiem|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjFqJy1bE-sC&pg=PP10 |isbn=9780520077096}}</ref> [[Joseph Leopold Eybler|Joseph von Eybler]] was one of the first composers to be asked to complete the score, and had worked on the movements from the Dies irae up until the Lacrymosa. In addition, a striking similarity between the openings of the Domine Jesu Christe movements in the requiems of the two composers suggests that Eybler at least looked at later sections.{{explain|date=October 2015}} After this work, he felt unable to complete the remainder and gave the manuscript back to Constanze Mozart.\n\nThe task was then given to another composer, [[Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr]]. S\u00fcssmayr borrowed some of Eybler's work in making his completion, and added his own orchestration to the movements from the Kyrie onward, completed the Lacrymosa, and added several new movements which a Requiem would normally comprise: Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei. He then added a final section, Lux aeterna by adapting the opening two movements which Mozart had written to the different words which finish the Requiem mass, which according to both S\u00fcssmayr and Mozart's wife was done according to Mozart's directions. Some people{{Who|date=February 2018}} consider it unlikely, however, that Mozart would have repeated the opening two sections if he had survived to finish the work.\n\nOther composers may have helped S\u00fcssmayr. The Agnus Dei is suspected by some scholars<ref>{{cite book |last=Leeson |year=2004 |first=Daniel N. |title=Opus Ultimum: The Story of the Mozart Requiem |publisher=Algora |location=New York |page=79 |quote=Mozart might have described specific instrumentation for the drafted sections, or the addition of a ''Sanctus'', a ''Benedictus'', and an ''Agnus Dei'', telling S\u00fcssmayr he would be obliged to compose those sections himself. }}</ref> to have been based on instruction or sketches from Mozart because of its similarity to a section from the Gloria of a previous mass (''[[Sparrow Mass]]'', K.&nbsp;220) by Mozart,<ref>{{cite book |first=R.

The various complete and incomplete manuscripts eventually turned up in the 19th century, but many of the figures involved left ambiguous statements on record as to how they were involved in the affair. Despite the controversy over how much of the music is actually Mozart's, the commonly performed S\u00fcssmayr version has become widely accepted by the public. This acceptance is quite strong, even when alternative completions provide logical and compelling solutions for the work.\n[[File:Costanze Mozart by Hanson 1802.jpg|left|thumb|Constanze in 1802, portrait by [[Hans Hansen (portrait painter)|Hans Hansen]]]]\n\n=== Promotion by Constanze Mozart ===\nThe confusion surrounding the circumstances of the Requiem's composition was created in a large part by Mozart's wife, Constanze. Constanze had a difficult task in front of her: she had to keep secret the fact that the Requiem was unfinished at Mozart's death, so she could collect the final payment from the commission. For a period of time, she also needed to keep secret the fact that S\u00fcssmayr had anything to do with the composition of the Requiem at all, in order to allow Count Walsegg the impression that Mozart wrote the work entirely himself. Once she received the commission, she needed to carefully promote the work as Mozart's so that she could continue to receive revenue from the work's publication and performance. During this phase of the Requiem's history, it was still important that the public accept that Mozart wrote the whole piece, as it would fetch larger sums from publishers and the public if it were completely by Mozart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Paul|date=1989|title=Mozart's Requiem; A Revaluation of the Evidence|url=|journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association|volume=114|issue=2|at=p. 211|jstor=766531|doi=10.1093/jrma/114.2.203}}</ref>\n\nIt is Constanze's efforts that created the flurry of half-truths and myths almost instantly after Mozart's death. According to Constanze, Mozart declared that he was composing the Requiem for himself and that he had been poisoned. His symptoms worsened, and he began to complain about the painful swelling of his body and high fever. Nevertheless, Mozart continued his work on the Requiem, and even on the last day of his life, he was explaining to his assistant how he intended to finish the Requiem.\n\nWith multiple levels of deception surrounding the Requiem's completion, a natural outcome is the mythologizing which subsequently occurred. One series of myths surrounding the Requiem involves the role [[Antonio Salieri]] played in the commissioning and completion of the Requiem (and in Mozart's death generally). While the most recent retelling of this myth is [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' and the [[Amadeus (film)|movie]] made from it, it is important to note that the source of misinformation was actually a 19th-century play by [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', which was turned into an opera by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and subsequently used as the framework for ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]''.<ref>Gregory Allen Robbins.

For example, at least three of the conflicting sources, all dated within two decades following Mozart's death, cite Constanze as their primary source of interview information.\n\n==== Friedrich Rochlitz ====\nIn 1798, [[Friedrich Rochlitz]], a German biographical author and amateur composer, published a set of Mozart anecdotes that he claimed to have collected during his meeting with Constanze in 1796.<ref name=\"Landon\">{{Cite book\n |last=Landon\n |first=H.

Schirmer|Schirmer Books]]\n |year=1988\n}}</ref> The Rochlitz publication makes the following statements:\n* Mozart was unaware of his commissioner's identity at the time he accepted the project.\n* He was not bound to any date of completion of the work.\n* He stated that it would take him around four weeks to complete.\n* He requested, and received, 100 ducats at the time of the first commissioning message.\n* He began the project immediately after receiving the commission.\n* His health was poor from the outset; he fainted multiple times while working.\n* He took a break from writing the work to visit the [[Prater]] with his wife.\n* He shared the thought with his wife that he was writing this piece for his own funeral.\n* He spoke of \"very strange thoughts\" regarding the unpredicted appearance and commission of this unknown man.\n* He noted that the departure of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] to Prague for the coronation was approaching.\n\nThe most highly disputed of these claims is the last one, the chronology of this setting. According to Rochlitz, the messenger arrives quite some time before the departure of Leopold for the coronation, yet there is a record of his departure occurring in mid-July 1791. However, as Constanze was in [[Baden bei Wien|Baden]] during all of June to mid-July, she would not have been present for the commission or the drive they were said to have taken together.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> Furthermore, ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (except for the Overture and March of the Priests) was completed by mid-July. ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' was commissioned by mid-July.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> There was no time for Mozart to work on the Requiem on the large scale indicated by the Rochlitz publication in the time frame provided.\n\n==== Franz Xaver Niemetschek ====\n[[File:Requiem6.png|thumb|1857 [[Lithography|lithograph]] by Franz Schramm, titled ''Ein Moment aus den letzten Tagen Mozarts'' (\"Moment from the Last Days of Mozart\").

He published his biography in 1808, containing a number of claims about Mozart's receipt of the Requiem commission:\n* Mozart received the commission very shortly before the Coronation of Emperor Leopold II and before he received the commission to go to Prague.\n* He did not accept the messenger's request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.\n* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work's completion.\n* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.\n* He fell ill while writing the work\n* He told Constanze \"I am only too conscious... my end will not be long in coming: for sure, someone has poisoned me! I cannot rid my mind of this thought.\"\n* Constanze thought that the Requiem was overstraining him; she called the doctor and took away the score.\n* On the day of his death, he had the score brought to his bed.\n* The messenger took the unfinished Requiem soon after Mozart's death.\n* Constanze never learned the commissioner's name.\n\nThis account, too, has fallen under scrutiny and criticism of its accuracy. According to letters, Constanze most certainly knew the name of the commissioner by the time this interview was released in 1800.<ref name=\"Boerner\" /> Additionally, the Requiem was not given to the messenger until some time after Mozart's death.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> This interview contains the only account from Constanze herself of the claim that she took the Requiem away from Wolfgang for a significant duration during his composition of it.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> Otherwise, the timeline provided in this account is historically probable.\n\n==== Georg Nikolaus von Nissen ====\nHowever, the most highly accepted text attributed to Constanze is the interview to her second husband, [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen]].<ref name=\"Landon\" /> After Nissen's death in 1826, Constanze released the biography of Wolfgang (1828) that Nissen had compiled, which included this interview. Nissen states:\n* Mozart received the commission shortly before the coronation of Emperor Leopold and before he received the commission to go to Prague.\n* He did not accept the messenger's request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.\n* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work's completion.\n* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.\n\nThe Nissen publication lacks information following Mozart's return from Prague.<ref name=\"Landon\" />\n\n== Influences ==\n[[File:Michaelhaydn1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Haydn]] (younger brother of [[Joseph Haydn]]), whose own [[Requiem (Michael Haydn)|Requiem]] influenced Mozart]]\nMozart esteemed [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in 1789 he was commissioned by Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]] to rearrange ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' ([[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 56).

Another influence was [[Michael Haydn]]'s [[Requiem (Michael Haydn)|Requiem in C minor]] which he and his father heard at the first three performances in January 1772. Some have noted that Michael Haydn's Introitus sounds rather similar to Mozart's, and the theme for Mozart's \"Quam olim Abrahae\" fugue is a direct quote of the theme from Haydn's Offertorium and Versus. In Introitus m. 21, the soprano sings \"Te decet hymnus Deus in Zion\". It is quoting the Lutheran hymn {{lang|de|[[Meine Seele erhebet den Herren]]}}. The melody is used by many composers e.g. in Bach's cantata [[Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10|''Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'', BWV 10]] but also in Michael Haydn's Requiem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/507126/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart-Requiem-in-D-Minor-Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Meine-Seel-Erhebt-Den-Herren/|title=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 'Requiem in D Minor'|website=WhoSampled.com|publisher=Discover the Sample Source|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem \"Mozart's Requiem\" was first published in ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' in 1828.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timeline of Mozart's Requiem}}\n\n== Modern completions ==\n{{Main|Modern completions of Mozart's Requiem}}\n\nIn the 1960s, a sketch for an Amen [[Fugue]] was discovered, which some musicologists (Levin, Maunder) believe belongs to the Requiem at the conclusion of the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]] after the Lacrymosa. [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] argues that this Amen fugue was not intended for the Requiem, rather that it \"may have been for a separate unfinished mass in D minor\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} to which the [[Kyrie in D minor, K. 341|Kyrie K.&nbsp;341]] also belonged.\n\nThere is, however, compelling evidence placing the Amen Fugue in the Requiem<ref>Paul Moseley: \"Mozart's Requiem: A Revaluation of the Evidence\" ''J Royal Music Assn'' (1989; 114) pp. 203\u2013237</ref> based on current Mozart scholarship. First, the principal [[Subject (music)|subject]] is the main theme of the Requiem (stated at the beginning, and throughout the work) in strict [[Melodic inversion|inversion]]. Second, it is found on the same page as a sketch for the Rex tremendae (together with a sketch for the overture of his last opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''), and thus surely dates from late 1791. The only place where the word 'Amen' occurs in anything that Mozart wrote in late 1791 is in the sequence of the Requiem. Third, as Levin points out in the foreword to his completion of the Requiem, the addition of the Amen Fugue at the end of the sequence results in an overall design that ends each large section with a fugue.\n\nSince the 1970s several composers and musicologists, dissatisfied with the traditional \"S\u00fcssmayr\" completion, have attempted alternative completions of the Requiem.\n\n==Autograph at the 1958 World's Fair==<!--Linked from [[Expo 58]]-->\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizonal\n|width=175\n|image1=Mozart K626 Arbeitspartitur last page.jpg\n|caption1=Mozart's manuscript with missing corner\n|image2=Quam olim dc in Mozart's hand.png\n|caption2=\"quam olim d: c\" in Mozart's hand\n}}\nThe autograph of the Requiem was placed on display at the [[Expo 58|World's Fair in 1958]] in Brussels.

The keyboard arrangements notably demonstrate the variety of approaches taken to translating the Requiem, particularly the Confutatis and Lacrimosa movements, in order to balance preserving the Requiem's character while also being physically playable. [[Karl Klindworth]]'s piano solo (c.1900), [[Muzio Clementi]]'s organ solo, and [[Renaud de Vilbac]]'s harmonium solo (c.1875) are liberal in their approach to achieve this. In contrast, [[Carl Czerny]] wrote his piano transcription for two players, enabling him to retain the extent of the score, if sacrificing timbral character. [[Franz Liszt]]'s piano solo (c.1865) departs the most in terms of fidelity and character of the Requiem, through its inclusion of composition devices used to showcase pianistic technique.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| author=C.
