Each font was a matched set of type, one piece (called a \"[[Sort (typesetting)|sort]]\") for each [[glyph]], and a typeface consisting of a range of fonts that shared an overall design. \n\nIn modern usage, with the advent of digital typography, \"font\" is frequently synonymous with \"typeface\". Each style is in a separate \"font file\"\u2014for instance, the typeface \"[[Bulmer (typeface)|Bulmer]]\" may include the fonts \"Bulmer [[roman type|roman]]\", \"Bulmer\", \"Bulmer bold\" and \"Bulmer extended\"\u2014but the term \"font\" might be applied either to one of these alone or to the whole typeface.\n\nIn both traditional typesetting and modern usage, the word \"font\" refers to the delivery mechanism of the typeface design. In traditional typesetting, the font would be made from metal or wood. Today, the font is a digital file. \n[[File:Friedlaender.webmsd.webm|thumb|Israeli typographer [[Henri Friedlaender]] examines ''Hadassah Hebrew'' typeface sketches. The sequence was shot in his study in [[Motza Illit]] (near Jerusalem) in 1978.]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''font'' (traditionally spelled ''fount'' in [[British English]], but in any case pronounced {{IPAc-en|f|\u0252|n|t}}) derives from [[Middle French]] ''fonte'' {{nowrap|\"[something}} that has been] melted; a [[casting (metalworking)|casting]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=font |title=font |year=2001 |author=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=2013-07-19 }}</ref> The term refers to the process of casting metal type at a [[type foundry]].\n\n==Metal type==\n\n[[File:Coalbrookdale Company auction poster - 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1910 [[letterpress]] poster, advertising an auction, using a variety of fonts]]\n\nIn a manual printing ([[letterpress]]) house the word \"font\" would refer to a complete set of [[typeface|metal type]] that would be used to [[typesetting|typeset]] an entire page. Upper- and lowercase letters get their names because of which case the metal type was located in for manual typesetting: the more distant upper case or the closer lower case. The same distinction is also referred to with the terms ''majuscule'' and ''minuscule''.\n\nUnlike a digital typeface, a metal font would not include a single definition of each character, but commonly used characters (such as vowels and periods) would have more physical type-pieces included. A font when bought new would often be sold as (for example in a Roman alphabet) 12pt 14A 34a, meaning that it would be a size 12-[[Point (typography)|point]] font containing 14 uppercase \"A\"s, and 34 lowercase \"A\"s.\n\nThe rest of the characters would be provided in quantities appropriate for the [[Letter frequency|distribution]] of letters in that language. Some metal type characters required in typesetting, such as [[em dash|dashes]], spaces and line-height spacers, were not part of a specific font, but were generic pieces which could be used with any font.<ref>{{cite web | title = Basic Letterpress Tools | url = http://my.execpc.com/~bosshard/printing/letrprss/basictools.html | accessdate = 2008-12-07 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205828/http://my.execpc.com/~bosshard/printing/letrprss/basictools.html | archivedate = 2008-12-24 }}</ref> Line spacing is still often called \"[[leading]]\", because the strips used for line spacing were made of [[lead]] (rather than the harder alloy used for other pieces). The reason for this spacing strip being made from \"lead\" was because lead was a softer metal than the traditional forged metal type pieces (which was part lead, antimony and tin) and would compress more easily when \"locked-up\" in the printing \"chase\" (i.e. a carrier for holding all the type together).\n\nIn the 1880s\u20131890s, \"hot lead\" typesetting was invented, in which type was cast as it was set, either piece by piece (as in the [[Monotype System|Monotype]] technology) or in entire lines of type at one time (as in the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] technology).\n\n==Characteristics==\nIn addition to the character height, when using the mechanical sense of the term, there are several characteristics which may distinguish fonts, though they would also depend on the [[writing system|script]](s) that the typeface supports. In European [[alphabet|alphabetic scripts]], i.e. [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], the main such properties are the [[#Weight|stroke width, called weight]], the [[#Slope|style or angle]] and the [[#Width|character width]].\n\nThe regular or standard font is sometimes labeled ''roman'', both to distinguish it from ''bold'' or ''thin'' and from ''italic'' or ''oblique''. The keyword for the default, regular case is often omitted for variants and never repeated, otherwise it would be ''Bulmer regular italic'', ''Bulmer bold regular'' and even ''Bulmer regular regular''. ''Roman'' can also refer to the language coverage of a font, acting as a shorthand for \"Western European\".\n\nDifferent fonts of the same typeface may be used in the same work for various degrees of readability and [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], or in a specific design to make it be of more visual interest.\n\n===Weight===\nThe weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height.\n\n[[File:Helvetica Neue typeface weights.svg|thumb|[[Helvetica|Helvetica Neue]] weights]]\nA typeface may come in fonts of many weights, from ultra-light to extra-bold or black; four to six weights are not unusual, and a few typefaces have as many as a dozen. Many typefaces for office, web and non-professional use come with a normal and a bold weight which are linked together. If no bold weight is provided, many renderers (browsers, word processors, graphic and DTP programs) support a bolder font by rendering the outline a second time at an offset, or smearing it slightly at a diagonal angle.\n\nThe base weight differs among typefaces; that means one font may appear bolder than another font. For example, fonts intended to be used in posters are often bold by default while fonts for long runs of text are rather light. Weight designations in font names may differ in regard to the actual absolute stroke weight or density of glyphs in the font.\n\nAttempts to systematize a range of weights led to a numerical classification first used by [[Adrian Frutiger]] with the [[Univers]] typeface: 35 ''Extra Light'', 45 ''Light'', 55 ''Medium'' or ''Regular'', 65 ''Bold'', 75 ''Extra Bold'', 85 ''Extra Bold'', 95 ''Ultra Bold'' or ''Black''.\nDeviants of these were the \"6 series\" (italics), e.g. ''46 Light Italics'' etc., the \"7 series\" (condensed versions), e.g. ''57 Medium Condensed'' etc., and the \"8 series\" (condensed italics), e.g. 68 ''Bold Condensed Italics''.\nFrom this brief numerical system it is easier to determine exactly what a font's characteristics are, for instance \"Helvetica 67\" (HE67) translates to \"Helvetica Bold Condensed\".\n\n[[File:Regular and bold.png|thumb|Regular and bold versions of three common fonts. [[Helvetica]] has a monoline design and all strokes increase in weight; less monoline fonts like [[Optima]] and [[Utopia (typeface)|Utopia]] increase the weight of the thicker strokes more and thinner strokes less in bold. In all three designs, the curve on 'n' thins as it joins the left-hand vertical.]]\n\nThe first algorithmic description of fonts was made by [[Donald Knuth]] in his [[Metafont]] description language and interpreter.\n\nThe [[TrueType]] font format introduced a scale from 100 through 900, which is also used in [[Cascading Stylesheets|CSS]] and [[OpenType]], where 400 is regular (roman or plain). \n\nThe [[Mozilla Developer Network]] provides the following rough mapping<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Common_weight_name_mapping|title=font-weight|website=Mozilla Developer Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-04}}</ref> to typical font weight names:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Names !! Numerical values \n|-\n|Thin / Hairline || 100\n|-\n|Ultra-light / Extra-light || 200\n|-\n| Light || 300 \n|-\n||Normal / regular || 400\n|-\n| Medium || 500\n|-\n| Semi-bold / Demi-bold || 600\n|-\n|Bold || 700\n|-\n| Extra-bold / Ultra-bold || 800\n|-\n| Heavy /  Black || 900\n|-\n| Extra-black / Ultra-black || 950\n|}\n\nFont mapping varies by font designer. A good example is [[Bigelow &amp; Holmes]]'s [[Go font]] family. In this family, '[the] fonts have CSS numerical weights of 400, 500, and 600. Although CSS specifies \"Bold\" as a 700 weight and 600 as Semibold or Demibold, the Go numerical weights match the actual progression of the ratios of stem thicknesses: Normal:Medium = 400:500; Normal:Bold = 400:600.'<ref name=\"Bigelow &amp; Holmes: Go font weighs\">{{cite web|title=Go fonts|url=https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts|publisher=GOLang.org|accessdate=22 August 2019|language=en-US|}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''normal'', ''regular'' and ''plain (''sometimes ''book)'', are used for the standard weight font of a typeface. Where both appear and differ, ''book'' is often lighter than ''regular'', but in some typefaces it is bolder.\n\nBefore the arrival of computers, each weight had to be drawn manually. As a result, many older multi-weight families such as [[Gill Sans]] and [[Monotype Grotesque]] have considerable differences in styles from light to extra-bold. Since the 1980s, it has become common to use automation to construct a range of weights as points along a trend, [[multiple master fonts|multiple master]] or other parameterized font design. This means that many modern digital fonts such as [[Myriad (typeface)|Myriad]] and [[TheSans]] are offered in a large range of weights which offer a smooth and continuous transition from one weight to the next, although some digital fonts are created with extensive manual corrections.\n\nAs digital font design allows more variants to be created faster, a common development in professional font design is the use of \"grades\": slightly different weights intended for different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient temperature and humidity.<ref name=\"Equity: specimen & manual\">{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Equity: specimen & manual|url=http://www.mbtype.com/pdf/equity-type-specimen.pdf|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Benton Modern\">{{cite web|title=Benton Modern|url=http://bentonmodern.webtype.com/formal/|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker design printed on [[coated paper|high-gloss magazine paper]] may come out looking identical, since in the former case the ink will soak and spread out more. Grades are offered with characters having the same width on all grades, so that a change of printing materials does not affect copy-fit.<ref name=\"Equity review\">{{cite web|last1=Porchez|first1=Jean Fran\u00e7ois|title=Equity review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/equity/|website=Typographica|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Grading Bennet\">{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Yves |title=Grading Bennet |url=https://liptonletterdesign.typenetwork.com/news/article/inside-the-fonts-grading-bennet |publisher=Type Network |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> Grades are common on serif fonts with their finer details.\n\n{{anchor|italic}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Font style}} Slope===\nIn European typefaces, especially Roman ones, a slope or slanted style is used to emphasize important words. This is called [[italic type|''italic'' type]] or [[oblique type]]. These designs normally slant to the right in left-to-right scripts. Oblique styles are often called italic, but differ from 'true italic' styles.\n\nItalic styles are more flowing than the normal typeface, approaching a more [[handwriting|handwritten]], [[cursive]] style, possibly using [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] more commonly or gaining [[swash (typography)|swash]]es. \nAlthough rarely encountered, a typographic face may be accompanied by a matching calligraphic face (''cursive'', ''script''), giving an exaggeratedly italic style.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|[[Cyrillic]] italics and allowed variations]]\nIn many sans-serif and some serif typefaces, especially in those with strokes of even thickness the characters of the italic fonts are only ''slanted'', which is often done algorithmically, without otherwise changing their appearance. Such ''[[oblique type|oblique]]'' fonts are not true italics, because lower-case letter-shapes do not change, but are often marketed as such. Fonts normally do not include both oblique and italic styles: the designer chooses to supply one or the other.\n\nSince italic styles clearly look different to regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have \"upright italic\" designs that take a more cursive form but remain upright; [[Computer Modern]] is an example of a font that offers this style.  In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex documents where a section of text already in italics needs a \"double italic\" style to add emphasis to it. For example, the Cyrillic [[Lower case|minuscule]] \"\u0442\" may look like a smaller form of its [[capital letter|majuscule]] \"\u0422\" or more like a roman small \"m\" as in its standard italic appearance; in this case the distinction between styles is also a matter of local preference<!--m-style in South(-East) Europe, the other in Russia-->.\n\nIn Frutiger's nomenclature the second digit for upright fonts is a 5, for italic fonts a 6 and for condensed italic fonts an 8.\n\nThe two [[Kana|Japanese syllabaries]], [[katakana]] and [[hiragana]], are sometimes seen as two styles or typographic variants of each other, but usually are considered separate character sets as a few of the characters have separate [[kanji]] origins and the scripts are used for different purposes. The [[blackletter|''gothic'' style]] of the roman script with broken letter forms, on the other hand, is usually considered a mere typographic variant.\n\nCursive-only scripts such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] also have different styles, in this case for example [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]], although these often depend on application, area or era.<!--There also have been proposals for real(NPOV?) Arabic typefaces without the need for different initial, medial, final and isolated forms or ligatures with even monospaced variants possible. (Source needed)-->\n\nThere are other aspects that can differ among font styles, but more often these are considered immanent features of the typeface. \nThese include the look of digits ([[text figures]]) and the minuscules, which may be smaller versions of the capital letters (''[[small caps]]'') although the script has developed characteristic shapes for them. \nSome typefaces do not include separate glyphs for the cases at all, thereby abolishing the [[letter case|bicamerality]]. While most of these use uppercase characters only, some labeled ''[[unicase]]'' exist which choose either the majuscule or the minuscule glyph at a common height for both characters.\n\n{{anchor|stretch}}\n{{clear}}\n===Width===\n[[File:Avenir Next regular and condensed widths.png|thumb|The typeface Avenir Next in condensed and regular widths.]]\nSome typefaces include fonts that vary the width of the characters (''stretch''), although this feature is usually rarer than weight or slope. Narrower fonts are usually labeled ''compressed'', ''condensed'' or ''narrow''. In Frutiger's system, the second digit of condensed fonts is a 7. \nWider fonts may be called ''wide'', ''extended'' or ''expanded''. \nBoth can be further classified by prepending ''extra'', ''ultra'' or the like. Compressing a font design to a condensed weight is a complex task, requiring the strokes to be slimmed down proportionally and often making the capitals straight-sided.{{efn|Simply digitally compressing the font produces ugly results, since it narrows the vertical strokes but not the horizontals.}}<ref name=\"Typeface Mechanics: 002\">{{cite web|last1=Frere-Jones|first1=Tobias|authorlink1=Tobias Frere-Jones|title=Typeface Mechanics: 002|url=https://frerejones.com/blog/typeface-mechanics-002|quote=If we change that interval of white space without changing anything else, this doesn\u2019t add up any more.

Serif text faces are often only issued in the regular width.\n\nThese separate fonts have to be distinguished from techniques that alter the [[letter-spacing]] to achieve narrower or smaller words, especially for [[Justification (typesetting)|justified text alignment]].\n\nMost typefaces either have [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] or [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] (i.e. typewriter-style) letter widths, if the script provides the possibility. There are, however, superfamilies covering both styles. Some fonts also provide both [[Typeface#Typesetting numbers|proportional and fixed-width]] (''tabular'') digits, where the former usually coincide with lowercase [[text figures]] and the latter with uppercase [[lining figures]].\n\nThe width of a font will depend on its intended use.

Glyph-level metrics include the glyph bounding box, the advance width (the proper distance between the glyph's initial pen position and the next glyph's initial pen position), and sidebearings (space that pads the glyph outline on either side). Many digital (and some metal type) fonts are able to be [[Kerning|kerned]] so that characters can be fitted more closely; the pair 'Wa' is a common example of this.\n\nSome fonts, especially those intended for professional use, are duplexed: made with multiple weights having the same character width so that (for example) changing from regular to bold or italic does not affect word wrap.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Concourse specimen pdf|url=http://typo.la/cots|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Sabon]] as originally designed was a notable example of this.

These may be switched on to allow users more flexibility to customise the font to suit their needs. The practice is not new: in the 1930s, [[Gill Sans]], a British design, was sold abroad with alternative characters to make it resemble fonts such as [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] popular in other countries, while [[Bembo]] from the same period has two styles of 'R': one with a stretched-out leg, matching its fifteenth-century model, and one less-common shorter version.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specimen Book of Monotype Printing Types (photograph)|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bogtrykkeren/5331070318|website=Flickr|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> With modern digital fonts, it is possible to group related alternative characters into stylistic sets, which may be turned on and off together. For example, in [[Caslon#Williams Caslon Text|Williams Caslon Text]], a revival of the 18th century font [[Caslon]], the default italic forms have many swashes matching the original design. For a more spare appearance, these can all be turned off at once by engaging stylistic set 4.<ref name=\"Williams Caslon Text features manual\">{{cite web|last1=Berkson|first1=William|title=Williams Caslon Text features manual|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/media/pdf/WilliamsCaslonText-Features.pdf|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Junicode]], intended for academic publishing, uses ss15 to enable a [[E caudata|variant form of 'e']] used in medieval Latin.

Oftentimes, users may only need a small subset of the glyphs that are available to them. Subsetting is the process of removing unnecessary glyphs from a font file, usually with the goal of reducing file size. This is particularly important for web fonts, since reducing file size often means reducing page load time and server load. Alternatively, fonts may be issued in different files for different regions of the world, though with the spread of the OpenType format this is now increasingly uncommon.\n\n== See also ==\n*[https://www.textsymbolsguru.com/ Stylish Text Symbols]\n* [[Clip font]]\n* [[Font embedding]]\n* [[Graphics|Graphic]]\n* [[List of fonts]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Blackwell, Lewis.

Each font was a matched set of type, one piece (called a \"[[Sort (typesetting)|sort]]\") for each [[glyph]], and a typeface consisting of a range of fonts that shared an overall design. \n\nIn modern usage, with the advent of digital typography, \"font\" is frequently synonymous with \"typeface\". Each style is in a separate \"font file\"\u2014for instance, the typeface \"[[Bulmer (typeface)|Bulmer]]\" may include the fonts \"Bulmer [[roman type|roman]]\", \"Bulmer\", \"Bulmer bold\" and \"Bulmer extended\"\u2014but the term \"font\" might be applied either to one of these alone or to the whole typeface.\n\nIn both traditional typesetting and modern usage, the word \"font\" refers to the delivery mechanism of the typeface design. In traditional typesetting, the font would be made from metal or wood. Today, the font is a digital file. \n[[File:Friedlaender.webmsd.webm|thumb|Israeli typographer [[Henri Friedlaender]] examines ''Hadassah Hebrew'' typeface sketches. The sequence was shot in his study in [[Motza Illit]] (near Jerusalem) in 1978.]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''font'' (traditionally spelled ''fount'' in [[British English]], but in any case pronounced {{IPAc-en|f|\u0252|n|t}}) derives from [[Middle French]] ''fonte'' {{nowrap|\"[something}} that has been] melted; a [[casting (metalworking)|casting]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=font |title=font |year=2001 |author=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=2013-07-19 }}</ref> The term refers to the process of casting metal type at a [[type foundry]].\n\n==Metal type==\n\n[[File:Coalbrookdale Company auction poster - 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1910 [[letterpress]] poster, advertising an auction, using a variety of fonts]]\n\nIn a manual printing ([[letterpress]]) house the word \"font\" would refer to a complete set of [[typeface|metal type]] that would be used to [[typesetting|typeset]] an entire page. Upper- and lowercase letters get their names because of which case the metal type was located in for manual typesetting: the more distant upper case or the closer lower case. The same distinction is also referred to with the terms ''majuscule'' and ''minuscule''.\n\nUnlike a digital typeface, a metal font would not include a single definition of each character, but commonly used characters (such as vowels and periods) would have more physical type-pieces included. A font when bought new would often be sold as (for example in a Roman alphabet) 12pt 14A 34a, meaning that it would be a size 12-[[Point (typography)|point]] font containing 14 uppercase \"A\"s, and 34 lowercase \"A\"s.\n\nThe rest of the characters would be provided in quantities appropriate for the [[Letter frequency|distribution]] of letters in that language. Some metal type characters required in typesetting, such as [[em dash|dashes]], spaces and line-height spacers, were not part of a specific font, but were generic pieces which could be used with any font.<ref>{{cite web | title = Basic Letterpress Tools | url = http://my.execpc.com/~bosshard/printing/letrprss/basictools.html | accessdate = 2008-12-07 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205828/http://my.execpc.com/~bosshard/printing/letrprss/basictools.html | archivedate = 2008-12-24 }}</ref> Line spacing is still often called \"[[leading]]\", because the strips used for line spacing were made of [[lead]] (rather than the harder alloy used for other pieces). The reason for this spacing strip being made from \"lead\" was because lead was a softer metal than the traditional forged metal type pieces (which was part lead, antimony and tin) and would compress more easily when \"locked-up\" in the printing \"chase\" (i.e. a carrier for holding all the type together).\n\nIn the 1880s\u20131890s, \"hot lead\" typesetting was invented, in which type was cast as it was set, either piece by piece (as in the [[Monotype System|Monotype]] technology) or in entire lines of type at one time (as in the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] technology).\n\n==Characteristics==\nIn addition to the character height, when using the mechanical sense of the term, there are several characteristics which may distinguish fonts, though they would also depend on the [[writing system|script]](s) that the typeface supports. In European [[alphabet|alphabetic scripts]], i.e. [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], the main such properties are the [[#Weight|stroke width, called weight]], the [[#Slope|style or angle]] and the [[#Width|character width]].\n\nThe regular or standard font is sometimes labeled ''roman'', both to distinguish it from ''bold'' or ''thin'' and from ''italic'' or ''oblique''. The keyword for the default, regular case is often omitted for variants and never repeated, otherwise it would be ''Bulmer regular italic'', ''Bulmer bold regular'' and even ''Bulmer regular regular''. ''Roman'' can also refer to the language coverage of a font, acting as a shorthand for \"Western European\".\n\nDifferent fonts of the same typeface may be used in the same work for various degrees of readability and [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], or in a specific design to make it be of more visual interest.\n\n===Weight===\nThe weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height.\n\n[[File:Helvetica Neue typeface weights.svg|thumb|[[Helvetica|Helvetica Neue]] weights]]\nA typeface may come in fonts of many weights, from ultra-light to extra-bold or black; four to six weights are not unusual, and a few typefaces have as many as a dozen. Many typefaces for office, web and non-professional use come with a normal and a bold weight which are linked together. If no bold weight is provided, many renderers (browsers, word processors, graphic and DTP programs) support a bolder font by rendering the outline a second time at an offset, or smearing it slightly at a diagonal angle.\n\nThe base weight differs among typefaces; that means one font may appear bolder than another font. For example, fonts intended to be used in posters are often bold by default while fonts for long runs of text are rather light. Weight designations in font names may differ in regard to the actual absolute stroke weight or density of glyphs in the font.\n\nAttempts to systematize a range of weights led to a numerical classification first used by [[Adrian Frutiger]] with the [[Univers]] typeface: 35 ''Extra Light'', 45 ''Light'', 55 ''Medium'' or ''Regular'', 65 ''Bold'', 75 ''Extra Bold'', 85 ''Extra Bold'', 95 ''Ultra Bold'' or ''Black''.\nDeviants of these were the \"6 series\" (italics), e.g. ''46 Light Italics'' etc., the \"7 series\" (condensed versions), e.g. ''57 Medium Condensed'' etc., and the \"8 series\" (condensed italics), e.g. 68 ''Bold Condensed Italics''.\nFrom this brief numerical system it is easier to determine exactly what a font's characteristics are, for instance \"Helvetica 67\" (HE67) translates to \"Helvetica Bold Condensed\".\n\n[[File:Regular and bold.png|thumb|Regular and bold versions of three common fonts. [[Helvetica]] has a monoline design and all strokes increase in weight; less monoline fonts like [[Optima]] and [[Utopia (typeface)|Utopia]] increase the weight of the thicker strokes more and thinner strokes less in bold. In all three designs, the curve on 'n' thins as it joins the left-hand vertical.]]\n\nThe first algorithmic description of fonts was made by [[Donald Knuth]] in his [[Metafont]] description language and interpreter.\n\nThe [[TrueType]] font format introduced a scale from 100 through 900, which is also used in [[Cascading Stylesheets|CSS]] and [[OpenType]], where 400 is regular (roman or plain). \n\nThe [[Mozilla Developer Network]] provides the following rough mapping<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Common_weight_name_mapping|title=font-weight|website=Mozilla Developer Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-04}}</ref> to typical font weight names:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Names !! Numerical values \n|-\n|Thin / Hairline || 100\n|-\n|Ultra-light / Extra-light || 200\n|-\n| Light || 300 \n|-\n||Normal / regular || 400\n|-\n| Medium || 500\n|-\n| Semi-bold / Demi-bold || 600\n|-\n|Bold || 700\n|-\n| Extra-bold / Ultra-bold || 800\n|-\n| Heavy /  Black || 900\n|-\n| Extra-black / Ultra-black || 950\n|}\n\nFont mapping varies by font designer. A good example is [[Bigelow &amp; Holmes]]'s [[Go font]] family. In this family, '[the] fonts have CSS numerical weights of 400, 500, and 600. Although CSS specifies \"Bold\" as a 700 weight and 600 as Semibold or Demibold, the Go numerical weights match the actual progression of the ratios of stem thicknesses: Normal:Medium = 400:500; Normal:Bold = 400:600.'<ref name=\"Bigelow &amp; Holmes: Go font weighs\">{{cite web|title=Go fonts|url=https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts|publisher=GOLang.org|accessdate=22 August 2019|language=en-US|}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''normal'', ''regular'' and ''plain (''sometimes ''book)'', are used for the standard weight font of a typeface. Where both appear and differ, ''book'' is often lighter than ''regular'', but in some typefaces it is bolder.\n\nBefore the arrival of computers, each weight had to be drawn manually. As a result, many older multi-weight families such as [[Gill Sans]] and [[Monotype Grotesque]] have considerable differences in styles from light to extra-bold. Since the 1980s, it has become common to use automation to construct a range of weights as points along a trend, [[multiple master fonts|multiple master]] or other parameterized font design. This means that many modern digital fonts such as [[Myriad (typeface)|Myriad]] and [[TheSans]] are offered in a large range of weights which offer a smooth and continuous transition from one weight to the next, although some digital fonts are created with extensive manual corrections.\n\nAs digital font design allows more variants to be created faster, a common development in professional font design is the use of \"grades\": slightly different weights intended for different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient temperature and humidity.<ref name=\"Equity: specimen & manual\">{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Equity: specimen & manual|url=http://www.mbtype.com/pdf/equity-type-specimen.pdf|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Benton Modern\">{{cite web|title=Benton Modern|url=http://bentonmodern.webtype.com/formal/|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker design printed on [[coated paper|high-gloss magazine paper]] may come out looking identical, since in the former case the ink will soak and spread out more.

This is called [[italic type|''italic'' type]] or [[oblique type]]. These designs normally slant to the right in left-to-right scripts. Oblique styles are often called italic, but differ from 'true italic' styles.\n\nItalic styles are more flowing than the normal typeface, approaching a more [[handwriting|handwritten]], [[cursive]] style, possibly using [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] more commonly or gaining [[swash (typography)|swash]]es. \nAlthough rarely encountered, a typographic face may be accompanied by a matching calligraphic face (''cursive'', ''script''), giving an exaggeratedly italic style.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|[[Cyrillic]] italics and allowed variations]]\nIn many sans-serif and some serif typefaces, especially in those with strokes of even thickness the characters of the italic fonts are only ''slanted'', which is often done algorithmically, without otherwise changing their appearance. Such ''[[oblique type|oblique]]'' fonts are not true italics, because lower-case letter-shapes do not change, but are often marketed as such. Fonts normally do not include both oblique and italic styles: the designer chooses to supply one or the other.\n\nSince italic styles clearly look different to regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have \"upright italic\" designs that take a more cursive form but remain upright; [[Computer Modern]] is an example of a font that offers this style.  In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex documents where a section of text already in italics needs a \"double italic\" style to add emphasis to it. For example, the Cyrillic [[Lower case|minuscule]] \"\u0442\" may look like a smaller form of its [[capital letter|majuscule]] \"\u0422\" or more like a roman small \"m\" as in its standard italic appearance; in this case the distinction between styles is also a matter of local preference<!--m-style in South(-East) Europe, the other in Russia-->.\n\nIn Frutiger's nomenclature the second digit for upright fonts is a 5, for italic fonts a 6 and for condensed italic fonts an 8.\n\nThe two [[Kana|Japanese syllabaries]], [[katakana]] and [[hiragana]], are sometimes seen as two styles or typographic variants of each other, but usually are considered separate character sets as a few of the characters have separate [[kanji]] origins and the scripts are used for different purposes. The [[blackletter|''gothic'' style]] of the roman script with broken letter forms, on the other hand, is usually considered a mere typographic variant.\n\nCursive-only scripts such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] also have different styles, in this case for example [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]], although these often depend on application, area or era.<!--There also have been proposals for real(NPOV?) Arabic typefaces without the need for different initial, medial, final and isolated forms or ligatures with even monospaced variants possible. (Source needed)-->\n\nThere are other aspects that can differ among font styles, but more often these are considered immanent features of the typeface. \nThese include the look of digits ([[text figures]]) and the minuscules, which may be smaller versions of the capital letters (''[[small caps]]'') although the script has developed characteristic shapes for them. \nSome typefaces do not include separate glyphs for the cases at all, thereby abolishing the [[letter case|bicamerality]]. While most of these use uppercase characters only, some labeled ''[[unicase]]'' exist which choose either the majuscule or the minuscule glyph at a common height for both characters.\n\n{{anchor|stretch}}\n{{clear}}\n===Width===\n[[File:Avenir Next regular and condensed widths.png|thumb|The typeface Avenir Next in condensed and regular widths.]]\nSome typefaces include fonts that vary the width of the characters (''stretch''), although this feature is usually rarer than weight or slope. Narrower fonts are usually labeled ''compressed'', ''condensed'' or ''narrow''. In Frutiger's system, the second digit of condensed fonts is a 7. \nWider fonts may be called ''wide'', ''extended'' or ''expanded''. \nBoth can be further classified by prepending ''extra'', ''ultra'' or the like. Compressing a font design to a condensed weight is a complex task, requiring the strokes to be slimmed down proportionally and often making the capitals straight-sided.{{efn|Simply digitally compressing the font produces ugly results, since it narrows the vertical strokes but not the horizontals.}}<ref name=\"Typeface Mechanics: 002\">{{cite web|last1=Frere-Jones|first1=Tobias|authorlink1=Tobias Frere-Jones|title=Typeface Mechanics: 002|url=https://frerejones.com/blog/typeface-mechanics-002|quote=If we change that interval of white space without changing anything else, this doesn\u2019t add up any more.

Serif text faces are often only issued in the regular width.\n\nThese separate fonts have to be distinguished from techniques that alter the [[letter-spacing]] to achieve narrower or smaller words, especially for [[Justification (typesetting)|justified text alignment]].\n\nMost typefaces either have [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] or [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] (i.e. typewriter-style) letter widths, if the script provides the possibility. There are, however, superfamilies covering both styles. Some fonts also provide both [[Typeface#Typesetting numbers|proportional and fixed-width]] (''tabular'') digits, where the former usually coincide with lowercase [[text figures]] and the latter with uppercase [[lining figures]].\n\nThe width of a font will depend on its intended use. [[Times New Roman]] was designed with the goal of having small width, to fit more text into a newspaper. On the other hand, [[Palatino]] has large width to increase readability. The \"[[billing block]]\" on a movie poster often uses extremely condensed type in order to meet union requirements on the people who must be credited and the font height relative to the rest of the poster.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/ben-schott-movies-billing-blocks.html?smid=pl-share|title=Assembling the Billing Block|last=Schott|first=Ben|date=February 23, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Optical size===\n[[File:Unterschiedliche Schriftformen pro Schriftgr\u00f6sse.jpg|thumb|A set of optical sizes developed at [[URW++]].

Font-wide metrics include [[cap height]] (the height of the capitals), [[x-height]] (the height of the lower-case letters) and [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] height, [[descender]] depth, and the font [[bounding box]]. Glyph-level metrics include the glyph bounding box, the advance width (the proper distance between the glyph's initial pen position and the next glyph's initial pen position), and sidebearings (space that pads the glyph outline on either side). Many digital (and some metal type) fonts are able to be [[Kerning|kerned]] so that characters can be fitted more closely; the pair 'Wa' is a common example of this.\n\nSome fonts, especially those intended for professional use, are duplexed: made with multiple weights having the same character width so that (for example) changing from regular to bold or italic does not affect word wrap.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Concourse specimen pdf|url=http://typo.la/cots|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Sabon]] as originally designed was a notable example of this. (This was a standard feature of the Linotype hot metal typesetting system with regular and italic being duplexed, requiring awkward design choices as italics normally are narrower than the roman.)\n\nA particularly important basic set of fonts that became an early standard in digital printing was the [[PostScript fonts#Core Font Set|Core Font Set]] included in the [[PostScript]] printing system developed by Apple and Adobe. To avoid paying licensing fees for this set, many computer companies commissioned \"metrically-compatible\" knock-off fonts with the same spacing, which could be used to display the same document without it seeming clearly different.

Single-storey characters are more commonly found as default in [[Sans-serif#Geometric|geometric]] [[sans-serif]] fonts such as [[Century Gothic]], shown at bottom.]]\nTypefaces may be made in variants for different uses.

These may be switched on to allow users more flexibility to customise the font to suit their needs. The practice is not new: in the 1930s, [[Gill Sans]], a British design, was sold abroad with alternative characters to make it resemble fonts such as [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] popular in other countries, while [[Bembo]] from the same period has two styles of 'R': one with a stretched-out leg, matching its fifteenth-century model, and one less-common shorter version.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specimen Book of Monotype Printing Types (photograph)|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bogtrykkeren/5331070318|website=Flickr|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> With modern digital fonts, it is possible to group related alternative characters into stylistic sets, which may be turned on and off together. For example, in [[Caslon#Williams Caslon Text|Williams Caslon Text]], a revival of the 18th century font [[Caslon]], the default italic forms have many swashes matching the original design. For a more spare appearance, these can all be turned off at once by engaging stylistic set 4.<ref name=\"Williams Caslon Text features manual\">{{cite web|last1=Berkson|first1=William|title=Williams Caslon Text features manual|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/media/pdf/WilliamsCaslonText-Features.pdf|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Junicode]], intended for academic publishing, uses ss15 to enable a [[E caudata|variant form of 'e']] used in medieval Latin. A corporation commissioning a modified version of a commercial font for their own use, meanwhile, might request that their preferred alternates be set to default.\n\nIt is common for fonts intended for use in books for young children to use simplified, single-storey forms of the lowercase letters ''a'' and ''g'' (sometimes also ''y'' and ''l''); these may be called ''infant'' or ''schoolbook'' alternates.

Oftentimes, users may only need a small subset of the glyphs that are available to them. Subsetting is the process of removing unnecessary glyphs from a font file, usually with the goal of reducing file size. This is particularly important for web fonts, since reducing file size often means reducing page load time and server load. Alternatively, fonts may be issued in different files for different regions of the world, though with the spread of the OpenType format this is now increasingly uncommon.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ampersand]]\n* [[Clip font]]\n* [[Font embedding]]\n* [[Graphics|Graphic]]\n* [[List of fonts]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Blackwell, Lewis.
