PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn rates compare well in costs with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]].

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed.

The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts:\n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players.\n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Jim|last= Townsend|title= A Real Look at Heroic Fantasy|magazine=[[Paper Mayhem]]|date= March\u2013April 1987|issue= 23|page= 24}}</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Steven|last= DuBois|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1997|month= |title= Monster Island: A Review |journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play By Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1997|issue= 82|pages= 4|id= |url= |accessdate= |ref=Dub97}}</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/Issue-19-Suspense&Decision-PBM-Magazine.pdf|title= Be More than a Player: Learning by Teaching in SuperNova & Middle-earth |first= Raven|last=Zachary|date= September 2019 |magazine=Suspense and Decision |issue=19 |publisher=playbymail.net|pages= 35\u201340|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth86/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth86/> <ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Role===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth86/> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect equates to more required searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth86a>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= }}</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1993 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref name=frontmatter/><ref name=Loth86a/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==Information Sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth86a/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"[[Different Worlds]], [[Dragon Magazine|Dragon]], [[Game New]], [[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]\".<ref name=Loth86a/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Play-by-mail games''''' (or '''''PBM games''''') are [[game]]s played through postal [[mail]], [[email]] or other [[digital media]].

PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts:\n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players.\n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Jim|last= Townsend|title= A Real Look at Heroic Fantasy|magazine=[[Paper Mayhem]]|date= March\u2013April 1987|issue= 23|page= 24}}</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Steven|last= DuBois|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1997|month= |title= Monster Island: A Review |journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play By Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1997|issue= 82|pages= 4|id= |url= |accessdate= |ref=Dub97}}</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/Issue-19-Suspense&Decision-PBM-Magazine.pdf|title= Be More than a Player: Learning by Teaching in SuperNova & Middle-earth |first= Raven|last=Zachary|date= September 2019 |magazine=Suspense and Decision |issue=19 |publisher=playbymail.net|pages= 35\u201340|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth86/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth86/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth86/> <ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Role===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth86/> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect equates to more required searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth86a>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= }}</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1993 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref name=frontmatter/><ref name=Loth86a/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==Information Sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth86a/> \"Minor\" sources included magazines such as \"[[Different Worlds]], [[Dragon Magazine|Dragon]], [[Game New]], [[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]\".<ref name=Loth86a/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "name_user": "Airborne84", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInformation Sources", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game"}

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nCorboy Glebe is bounded on the north by [[Kildoagh]] townland, on the west by [[Cloncurkney]] townland,  on the south by [[Gortaclogher]] townland and on the east by [[Port, Templeport]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Bellaboy Lough (Irish = Loch B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Bu\u00ed = The Lake of the Entrance to the Yellow Ford), Templeport Lough, a wood, streams and a sandpit. There are also three exceptional specimen trees in the townland- a Sycamore ([[Acer pseudoplatanus]]) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/125.htm]; a [[Beech]] (Fagus Sylvatica) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/126.htm] and a Lime ([[Tilia \u00d7 europaea]]) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/127.htm]. Corboy Glebe is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 145 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Corboy''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Corboy''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Cockboy''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Corkboy''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nCorboy Glebe formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''.

It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''.

It is known for its very large physical paper format ([[aspect ratio (newspaper)|Nordisch]]) and its long and detailed articles.\n\n== Print edition ==\n\n=== Sections and supplements ===\nThe ''Zeit'' is divided into different sections, some of which are:\n* Politik (''English: politics'')\n* Streit (''English literally: fight'')\n* Dossier (''English: dossier)\n* Geschichte (''English: history'')\n* Wirtschaft (''English: economy'')\n* Wissen (''English: Science'')\n* Feuilleton (''English: features'')\n* Zeitmagazin\n\n=== Appearance and printing ===\n[[File:ZEIT - Nr1-12-1946.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 1 to 12 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; closed gate]]\n[[File:Czeschka -ZEIT-Hbg-Wappen.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 13 to 18 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; open gate]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - bis Nr. 18 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead edition 13 to 18 (1946)]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - ab Nr. 19 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead since edition 19 (1946)]]\n\nThe masthead lettering in the weekly ''Die Zeit'' with its elegant font was designed by [[Carl Otto Czeschka]] in 1946. Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' which shows the [[Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom|British national coat of arms]] in between ''The'' and ''Times''. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder's self-conception which he published in an editorial called \"''Unsere Aufgabe''{{-\"}} (English: \"Our Mission\") on February 21, 1946.\n\nThe very first version of Czeschka's design, which included the [[Hamburg]] crest, was used from the first edition (published on February 21, 1946) to the 12th edition (published on May 9, 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock's feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions' legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great [[Coat_of_arms_of_Hamburg| Hamburg coat of arms]] by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a [[national emblem]] for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, ''Zeit Magazin'' changed its masthead on June 27, 1946, into the [[Coat_of_arms_of_Bremen| Coat of arms of Bremen]]: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], the mayor of [[Bremen]]. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef M\u00fcller-Marein who later became the editorial director of the ''Zeit''. The design with the ''Bremer Schl\u00fcssel'' in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist [[Alfred Mahlau]] had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of the ''Zeit'' and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in ''Tiemann-Antiqua''. The running texts are printed in ''[[Garamond]]'', a font that is very frequently used in books.\n\nThe ''Zeit'' did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional [[German orthography]], which was led by [[Der Spiegel]], S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and [[Bild]]. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, the ''Zeit'' refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the [[Duden]]. The [[Newspaper_format#Sizes_and_aspect_ratios|nordisch format]], a trademark of the newspaper, has always been addressed in literature and cabaret\u2014mostly in satirical form. According to Hanns Dieter H\u00fcsche the ''Zeit'' is \"''so gro\u00df, wenn man die aufschl\u00e4gt, muss der Nachbar gleich zum Zahnarzt''{{-\"}} (English literally: \"so big, if you open it, the neighbour must go to the dentist immediately\"). In reality however, the format is not bigger than that of a dozen other [[List_of_newspapers_in_Germany|German newspapers]]. The ''Zeit'' is printed by the [[Printer_(publishing)|printers]] Frankfurter Societ\u00e4ts-Druckerei GmbH in M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf and [[Axel Springer SE]] in [[Ahrensburg]]. The [[Deutscher Pressevertrieb]], based in Hamburg, is in charge of the distribution of the newspapers.\n\n=== Zeitmagazin ===\nThe ''Zeitmagazin'' was first published as a supplement in 1970 and later discontinued in 1999. The ''Zeit'' then introduced the section ''Leben'' (''English: Lifestyle''). Since May 24 2007, the ''Zeit'' reintroduced the ''Zeitmagazin''.\nFor the supplement's 40th birthday, the ''Zeit'' published a 100-page anniversary issue, including 40 different covers - one for each year.\n\n=== Circulation ===\nThe 1993 circulation of ''Die Zeit'' was 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Humphreys|title=Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=82|url=https://www.google.com.tr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2vlTzbOGhdIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=media+and+magazines+in+central+europe&ots=rDZApnAeFb&sig=3smUcJ-cI-LHdK1BuERlh1TnG4I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> With a circulation of 504,072 for the second half of 2012<ref name=zeitm>{{cite web|title=The Die Zeit Universe|url=http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|work=ZEITmagazin|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=1 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144920/http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and an estimated readership of slightly above 2 million, it is the most widely read German weekly newspaper.

The independent editorial office consists of around 70 editors, graphic designers and technicians. Upon February 1, 2009, ''Zeit Online'', ''Tagesspiegel Online'' and ''zoomer.de'' were merged into ''Zeit Digital'' with one joint editorial office in [[Berlin]]. Only some editors as well as the technology and the marketing departments remained in [[Hamburg]]. ''Zoomer.de'' was discontinued in February 2009, and the editorial office of ''Tagesspiegel Online'' was handed back to ''Tagesspiegel'' in September 2009. In 2017, ''Die Zeit'' was among the most quoted sources in German Wikipedia. At present, it is one of the 100 most visited websites in Germany.\n\n'''Sections: '''\n\nThe content is categorized into four section groups that each consist of one or more sections, as follows: \n\n-\tPolitics, Economy and Society\n\n-\tCulture and Discovery\n\n-\tKnowledge & Digital \n\n-\tSports \n\nSince April 2014, Zeit Online also has been publishing a local section for Hamburg.\n\nIn a survey of German literature blogs, the literature section of Zeit Online was rated as the best portal, better than the literature section of Spiegel, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine amongst others. \n\nOn November, 2nd 2012, Zeit online launched a Content API that developers can use.\n\n'''Website traffic:''' \n\nUp to 2017, the Zeit experienced a significant increase in clicks on their website. In March 2017, Z+ was launched and so was a payment model for the new product. Since then, some of the content has only been available after payment. \n\nIn January 2019, the website was visited 75,1 million times. On average, 2,34 pages were opened per visit. \n\n'''Recent History:''' \n\nGero von Randow, a former Zeit editor, was the editor-in-chief until February 2008. The journalist Wolfgang Blau took over his position in March of that year. Blau joined The Guardian in April 2013. Since March 15th, 2013, Jochen Wegner has been in charge.

It is known for its very large physical paper format ([[aspect ratio (newspaper)|Nordisch]]) and its long and detailed articles.\n\n== Print edition ==\n\n=== Sections and supplements ===\nThe ''Zeit'' is divided into different sections. Some of which are:\n* Politik (''English: politics'')\n* Streit (''English literally: fight'')\n* Dossier (''English: dossier)\n* Geschichte (''English: history'')\n* Wirtschaft (''English: economy'')\n* Wissen (''English: Science'')\n* Feuilleton (''English: features'')\n* Zeitmagazin \n\n=== Appearance and printing ===\n[[File:ZEIT - Nr1-12-1946.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 1 to 12 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; closed gate]]\n[[File:Czeschka -ZEIT-Hbg-Wappen.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 13 to 18 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; open gate]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - bis Nr. 18 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead edition 13 to 18 (1946)]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - ab Nr. 19 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead since edition 19 (1946)]]\n\nThe masthead lettering in the weekly ''Die Zeit'' with its elegant font was designed by [[Carl Otto Czeschka]] in 1946. Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' which shows the [[Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom|British national coat of arms]] in between ''The'' and ''Times''. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder's self-conception which he published in an editorial called \"''Unsere Aufgabe''{{-\"}} (English: \"Our Mission\") on February 21, 1946.\n\nThe very first version of Czeschka's design, which included the [[Hamburg]] crest, was used from the first edition (published on February 21, 1946) to the 12th edition (published on May 9, 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock's feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions' legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great [[Coat_of_arms_of_Hamburg| Hamburg coat of arms]] by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a [[national emblem]] for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, ''Zeit Magazin'' changed its masthead on June 27, 1946, into the [[Coat_of_arms_of_Bremen| Coat of arms of Bremen]]: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], the mayor of [[Bremen]]. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef M\u00fcller-Marein who later became the editorial director of the ''Zeit''. The design with the ''Bremer Schl\u00fcssel'' in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist [[Alfred Mahlau]] had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of the ''Zeit'' and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in ''Tiemann-Antiqua''. The running texts are printed in ''[[Garamond]]'', a font that is very frequently used in books.\n\nThe ''Zeit'' did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional [[German orthography]], which was led by [[Der Spiegel]], S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and [[Bild]]. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, the ''Zeit'' refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the [[Duden]]. The [[Newspaper_format#Sizes_and_aspect_ratios|nordisch format]], a trademark of the newspaper, has always been addressed in literature and cabaret\u2014mostly in satirical form. According to Hanns Dieter H\u00fcsche the ''Zeit'' is \"''so gro\u00df, wenn man die aufschl\u00e4gt, muss der Nachbar gleich zum Zahnarzt''{{-\"}} (English literally: \"so big, if you open it, the neighbour must go to the dentist immediately\"). In reality however, the format is not bigger than that of a dozen other [[List_of_newspapers_in_Germany|German newspapers]]. The ''Zeit'' is printed by the [[Printer_(publishing)|printers]] Frankfurter Societ\u00e4ts-Druckerei GmbH in M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf and [[Axel Springer SE]] in [[Ahrensburg]]. The [[Deutscher Pressevertrieb]], based in Hamburg, is in charge of the distribution of the newspapers.\n\n=== Zeitmagazin ===\nThe ''Zeitmagazin'' was first published as a supplement in 1970 and later discontinued in 1999. The ''Zeit'' then introduced the section ''Leben'' (''English: Lifestyle''). Since May 24 2007, the ''Zeit'' reintroduced the ''Zeitmagazin''.\nFor the supplement's 40th birthday, the ''Zeit'' published a 100-page anniversary issue, including 40 different covers - one for each year.\n\n=== Circulation ===\nThe 1993 circulation of ''Die Zeit'' was 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Humphreys|title=Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=82|url=https://www.google.com.tr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2vlTzbOGhdIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=media+and+magazines+in+central+europe&ots=rDZApnAeFb&sig=3smUcJ-cI-LHdK1BuERlh1TnG4I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> With a circulation of 504,072 for the second half of 2012<ref name=zeitm>{{cite web|title=The Die Zeit Universe|url=http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|work=ZEITmagazin|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=1 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144920/http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and an estimated readership of slightly above 2 million, it is the most widely read German weekly newspaper.

The passport is sometimes referred to by some local residents as '''Taiwan Passport''' or '''Taiwanese passport'''.\n\nThe status and international recognition of the ROC passport is complicated due to the political status of the Republic of China which is located in Taiwan, a province of China. The [[Nationality Law of the Republic of China]] considers not only residents of [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu]], but eligible [[overseas Chinese]] and Chinese residents of [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]] to be nationals of the Republic of China.<ref>Roger Mark Selya, Development and Demographic Change in Taiwan (World Scientific, 2004), p. 329.</ref> It is worth noting that the vast majority of Chinese-descent residents in Hong Kong, Macau or Mainland China are also [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|nationals of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and do not hold any identification documents issued by the ROC despite the fact that PRC and ROC are two different governments of one same nation. Individuals in the latter two categories may be eligible for a ROC passport under [[#Eligibility for Taiwan passports|certain conditions]], but do not have [[Hukou system|household registration]] in Taiwan (i.e. they are \"nationals without household registration\", or \"NWOHR\"), and thus do not enjoy the [[right of abode]] in Taiwan.{{efn|Lack of right of abode means that the passport holder cannot be deported to the issuing country of the passport.

The earliest verifiable ROC passports were issued by the [[Beiyang Government]] in Beijing in September 1919, and an ROC passport booklet was first issued by Beiyang Foreign Minister [[Wellington Koo|Wellington Koo Wei-chun]] in April 1922. At the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945, the Republic of China was given administrative jurisdiction over Taiwan and maintained control of it ever since. At the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the ROC lost its control of [[Mainland China]] to the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Henceforth, the ROC has been able to administer only Taiwan and some islands off the Mainland's coast. Maintaining the view that it is still the legitimate government of the whole of China, the ROC does not formally recognize the legitimacy of PRC. It has also constitutionally defined all the territory under its control as the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China|Free Area]]\" (or the \"Taiwan Area\") and the territory outside Taiwan Area as the \"Mainland Area\". The ROC constitution allows the ROC government to make laws for one Area of the country without affecting the other Area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nHowever, permanent residents in the Mainland Area, Hong Kong or Macau are not generally eligible to obtain a ROC passport [Passport Act, Article 6].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawContentIf.aspx?PCODE=E0030001 |title=Passport Act |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Furthermore, Overseas Chinese applicants normally must submit one of the following forms of proof of ROC nationality [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 4]:<ref name=\"enforcement\">{{cite web |url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAllIf.aspx?PCode=E0030004 |title=Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n* A ROC passport;\n* A Certificate of Overseas Chinese status, issued on the basis of proof of ROC nationality;\n* Proof of ROC nationality for a parent or ancestor, together with proof of descent.\n\nAs the first ROC nationality law, in effect from 5 February 1929 to 9 February 2000, only permitted ROC national fathers to pass nationality down to the descendants, any person who was born on or before 9 February 1980 to an ROC national mother and a foreign father is not a ROC national, regardless of place of birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.tw/chi/chi_faq/faq_detail.aspx?t=2&n=4533&p=3&f=2|title=Determination of ROC nationality|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThere are certain exceptions to this in certain cases for first and second generation emigrants, but in general an applicant will be unable to obtain a ROC passport unless he already holds ROC-issued nationality documentation for himself or an ancestor.\n\nTherefore, for a person to obtain a ROC passport, one of the following must normally apply:\n* The person first obtained proof of ROC nationality before 1949, when the ROC controlled the Mainland Area; or\n* The person first obtained a ROC passport or a Certificate of Overseas Chinese status before 1 July 1997 as a resident of Hong Kong, or before 20 December 1999 as resident of Macau; or\n* The person first obtained a ROC passport before 2002, as an Overseas-born Chinese, on the basis of Chinese ethnicity, before the Passport Act Enforcement Rules were revised to prevent this; or\n* The person obtained an ROC passport after emigrating overseas from the Mainland Area [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 18];<ref name=\"enforcement\" /> or\t\n* The person obtained an ROC passport after emigrating overseas from Hong Kong or Macau, whilst not holding a foreign passport other than a BN(O) passport [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 19], or after being born overseas to a parent who so emigrated;<ref name=\"enforcement\" /> or\n* The person has an ancestor in one of the previous categories (i.e. the ancestor actually obtained the ROC document, as opposed to merely having the right to do so), and the chain of descent is through the male line until 9 February 1980 (afterwards the chain of descent can be through the mother or father).\nThe interior is in [[traditional Chinese characters]] and English. Until the mid-1990s, the passport also contained an entry for provincial ancestry (\u7c4d\u8cab), stating the Chinese province and county of one's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]], but this field has been eliminated. However, the Chinese province or county of birth is still listed in the birthplace entry if the passport holder was born in either Mainland China or Taiwan.\n\n==Visa requirements==\n{{main|Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens (6).png|thumb|right|400px|Map of visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens]]\nVisa requirements for Taiwan passport holders are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on nationals of Taiwan.

The passport is also commonly referred to as a '''Taiwan Passport''' or a '''Taiwanese passport'''.\n\nThe status and international recognition of the ROC passport is complicated due to the [[political status of Taiwan]]. The [[Nationality Law of the Republic of China]] considers not only residents of [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu]], but eligible [[overseas Chinese]] and Chinese residents of [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]] to be nationals of the Republic of China.<ref>Roger Mark Selya, Development and Demographic Change in Taiwan (World Scientific, 2004), p. 329.</ref> It is worth noting that the vast majority of Chinese-descent residents in Hong Kong, Macau or Mainland China are also [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|nationals of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and do not hold any identification documents issued by the ROC. Individuals in the latter two categories may be eligible for a ROC passport under [[#Eligibility for Taiwan passports|certain conditions]], but do not have [[Hukou system|household registration]] in Taiwan (i.e. they are \"nationals without household registration\", or \"NWOHR\"), and thus do not enjoy the [[right of abode]] in Taiwan.{{efn|Lack of right of abode means that the passport holder cannot be deported to the issuing country of the passport.

The earliest verifiable ROC passports were issued by the [[Beiyang Government]] in Beijing in September 1919, and an ROC passport booklet was first issued by Beiyang Foreign Minister [[Wellington Koo|Wellington Koo Wei-chun]] in April 1922. At the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945, the Republic of China was given administrative jurisdiction over Taiwan and maintained control of it ever since. At the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the ROC lost its control of [[Mainland China]] to the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Henceforth, the ROC has been able to administer only Taiwan and some islands off the Mainland's coast. Maintaining the view that it is still the legitimate government of the whole of China, the ROC does not formally recognize the legitimacy of PRC. It has also constitutionally defined all the territory under its control as the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China|Free Area]]\" (or the \"Taiwan Area\") and the territory outside Taiwan Area as the \"Mainland Area\". The ROC constitution allows the ROC government to make laws for one Area of the country without affecting the other Area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nHowever, permanent residents in the Mainland Area, Hong Kong or Macau are not generally eligible to obtain a ROC passport [Passport Act, Article 6].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawContentIf.aspx?PCODE=E0030001 |title=Passport Act |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Furthermore, Overseas Chinese applicants normally must submit one of the following forms of proof of ROC nationality [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 4]:<ref name=\"enforcement\">{{cite web |url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAllIf.aspx?PCode=E0030004 |title=Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n* A ROC passport;\n* A Certificate of Overseas Chinese status, issued on the basis of proof of ROC nationality;\n* Proof of ROC nationality for a parent or ancestor, together with proof of descent.\n\nAs the first ROC nationality law, in effect from 5 February 1929 to 9 February 2000, only permitted ROC national fathers to pass nationality down to the descendants, any person who was born on or before 9 February 1980 to an ROC national mother and a foreign father is not a ROC national, regardless of place of birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.tw/chi/chi_faq/faq_detail.aspx?t=2&n=4533&p=3&f=2|title=Determination of ROC nationality|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThere are certain exceptions to this in certain cases for first and second generation emigrants, but in general an applicant will be unable to obtain a ROC passport unless he already holds ROC-issued nationality documentation for himself or an ancestor.\n\nTherefore, for a person to obtain a ROC passport, one of the following must normally apply:\n* The person first obtained proof of ROC nationality before 1949, when the ROC controlled the Mainland Area; or\n* The person first obtained a ROC passport or a Certificate of Overseas Chinese status before 1 July 1997 as a resident of Hong Kong, or before 20 December 1999 as resident of Macau; or\n* The person first obtained a ROC passport before 2002, as an Overseas-born Chinese, on the basis of Chinese ethnicity, before the Passport Act Enforcement Rules were revised to prevent this; or\n* The person obtained an ROC passport after emigrating overseas from the Mainland Area [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 18];<ref name=\"enforcement\" /> or\t\n* The person obtained an ROC passport after emigrating overseas from Hong Kong or Macau, whilst not holding a foreign passport other than a BN(O) passport [Passport Act Enforcement Rules, Article 19], or after being born overseas to a parent who so emigrated;<ref name=\"enforcement\" /> or\n* The person has an ancestor in one of the previous categories (i.e. the ancestor actually obtained the ROC document, as opposed to merely having the right to do so), and the chain of descent is through the male line until 9 February 1980 (afterwards the chain of descent can be through the mother or father).\nThe interior is in [[traditional Chinese characters]] and English. Until the mid-1990s, the passport also contained an entry for provincial ancestry (\u7c4d\u8cab), stating the Chinese province and county of one's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]], but this field has been eliminated.

The report also highlighted the lack of communication between the BOCA and the CEPP, which failed to exercise due diligence on copyright issues and did not independently verify the correctness of the image due to the BOCA's status as a long-time customer.
