This method allows direct viewing of nanoparticles as they melt, making it possible to test and characterize samples with a wider distribution of particle sizes. The TEM limits the pressure range at which melting point depression can be tested.\n\nMore recently, researchers developed nano[[calorimeter]]s that directly measure the [[enthalpy]] and melting temperature of nanoparticles.<ref name=\"Lai\"/> Nanocalorimeters provide the same data as bulk calorimeters, however additional calculations must account for the presence of the substrate supporting the particles. A narrow size distribution of nanoparticles is required since the procedure does not allow users to view the sample during the melting process. There is no way to characterize the exact size of melted particles during experiment.\n\n==History==\n\nMelting point depression was predicted in 1909 by Pawlow.<ref>P. Pawlow. Z. Phys.

[[Diffraction pattern]]s changed from characteristic crystalline patterns to liquid patterns as the small particles melted, allowing Takagi to estimate the melting temperature from the electron beam energy.\n\n==Physics==\n\nNanoparticles have a much greater surface to volume ratio than bulk materials. The increased surface to volume ratio means surface atoms have a much greater effect on chemical and physical properties of a nanoparticle. Surface [[atom]]s bind in the solid phase with less cohesive energy because they have fewer neighboring atoms in close proximity compared to atoms in the bulk of the solid. Each [[chemical bond]] an atom shares with a neighboring atom provides cohesive energy, so atoms with fewer bonds and neighboring atoms have lower cohesive energy. The cohesive energy of the nanoparticle has been theoretically calculated as a function of particle size according to Equation 1.<ref name=\"Qi\">{{cite journal|author1=W. H. Qi  |author2=M. P.

An atom experiences an attractive force with all nearby atoms according to the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. The Lennard-Jones pair-potential shown in Figure 2 models the cohesive energy between atoms as a function of separation distance.\n\n[[Image:Lennard-Jones.jpg|thumb|right|700px|Figure 2. A Lennard-Jones potential energy curve. The model shows the interactive energy between 2 atoms at a normalized distance, d/d<sub>0</sub>, where d<sub>0</sub>=atomic diameter. The interaction energy is attractive where the curve is negative, and the magnitude of the energy represents the cohesive energy between a pair of atoms. Note that the attractive potential extends over a long range beyond the length of a chemical bond, so atoms experience cohesive energy with atoms further than their nearest neighbors.]]\n\nThe cohesive energy of an atom is directly related to the thermal energy required to free the atom from the solid.

The BOLS model calculates the melting temperature for individual atoms from the sum of their cohesive bonds. As a result, the BOLS predicts the surface layers of a nanoparticle melt at lower temperatures than the bulk of the nanoparticle.\n\nThe BOLS mechanism states that if one bond breaks the remaining neighbouring ones become shorter and stronger. The cohesive energy, or the sum of bond energy, of the less coordinated atoms determines the thermal stability including melting, evaporating and other phase transition. The lowered CN changes the equilibrium bond length between atoms near the surface of the nanoparticle. The bonds relax towards equilibrium lengths, increasing the cohesive energy per bond between atoms, independent of the exact form of the specific [[interatomic potential]]. However, the integrated cohesive energy for surface atoms is much lower than bulk atoms due to the reduced coordination number and overall decrease in cohesive energy.\n\nUsing a core\u2013shell configuration, the melting point depression of nanoparticles is dominated by the outermost two atomic layers yet atoms in the core interior remain their bulk nature.\n\nThe BOLS model and the core\u2013shell structure have been applied to other size dependency of nanostructures such as the mechanical strength, chemical and thermal stability, lattice dynamics (optical and acoustic phonons), Photon emission and absorption, electronic colevel shift and [[work function]] modulation, magnetism at various temperatures, and dielectrics due to electron polarization etc. Reproduction of experimental observations in the above-mentioned size dependency has been realized. Quantitative information such as the energy level of an isolated atom and the vibration frequency of individual dimer has been obtained by matching the BOLS predictions to the measured size dependency.<ref name=\"Size\"/>\n\n==Particle shape==\n\nNanoparticle shape impacts the melting point of a nanoparticle. Facets, edges and deviations from a perfect sphere all change the magnitude of melting point depression.<ref name=\"Nanda\"/> These shape changes affect the surface to volume ratio, which affects the cohesive energy and thermal properties of a nanostructure.

The LNG defines melting conditions through the Gibbs-Duhem relations, yielding a melting temperature function dependent on the interfacial energies between the solid and liquid phases, volumes and surface areas of each phase, and size of the nanoparticle. The model calculations show that the liquid phase forms at lower temperatures for smaller nanoparticles. Once the liquid phase forms, the free energy conditions quickly change and favor melting. Equation 6 gives the melting conditions for a spherical nanoparticle according to the LNG model.<ref name=\"Wang\"/>\n\n<math>T_M(d)=\\frac{2T_{MB}}{H_fd}(\\sigma\\,_{sl}-\\sigma\\,_{lv}3(\\sigma\\,_{sv}-\\sigma\\,_{lv}\\frac{\\rho\\,_s}{\\rho\\,_l}))</math>\n\n===Bond-order-length-strength (BOLS) model===\n\nThe '''bond-order-length-strength''' (BOLS) model employs an atomistic approach to explain melting point depression.<ref name=\"Wang\"/> The model focuses on the cohesive energy of individual atoms rather than a classical thermodynamic approach. The BOLS model calculates the melting temperature for individual atoms from the sum of their cohesive bonds. As a result, the BOLS predicts the surface layers of a nanoparticle melt at lower temperatures than the bulk of the nanoparticle.\n\nThe BOLS mechanism states that if one bond breaks the remaining neighbouring ones become shorter and stronger. The cohesive energy, or the sum of bond energy, of the less coordinated atoms determines the thermal stability including melting, evaporating and other phase transition. The lowered CN changes the equilibrium bond length between atoms near the surface of the nanoparticle. The bonds relax towards equilibrium lengths, increasing the cohesive energy per bond between atoms, independent of the exact form of the specific [[interatomic potential]]. However, the integrated cohesive energy for surface atoms is much lower than bulk atoms due to the reduced coordination number and overall decrease in cohesive energy.\n\nUsing a core\u2013shell configuration, the melting point depression of nanoparticles is dominated by the outermost two atomic layers yet atoms in the core interior remain their bulk nature.\n\nThe BOLS model and the core\u2013shell structure have been applied to other size dependency of nanostructures such as the mechanical strength, chemical and thermal stability, lattice dynamics (optical and acoustic phonons), Photon emission and absorption, electronic colevel shift and [[work function]] modulation, magnetism at various temperatures, and dielectrics due to electron polarization etc. Reproduction of experimental observations in the above-mentioned size dependency has been realized. Quantitative information such as the energy level of an isolated atom and the vibration frequency of individual dimer has been obtained by matching the BOLS predictions to the measured size dependency.<ref name=\"Size\"/>\n\n==Particle shape==\n\nNanoparticle shape impacts the melting point of a nanoparticle. Facets, edges and deviations from a perfect sphere all change the magnitude of melting point depression.<ref name=\"Nanda\"/> These shape changes affect the surface to volume ratio, which affects the cohesive energy and thermal properties of a nanostructure. Equation 7 gives a general shape corrected formula for the theoretical melting point of a nanoparticle based on its size and shape.<ref name=\"Nanda\"/>\n\n<math>T_M(d)=T_{MB}(1-\\frac{c}{zd})</math><br />\nWhere: c=materials constant<br />\n::z=shape parameter of particle\n\nThe shape parameter is 1 for sphere and 3/2 for a very long wire, indicating that melting-point depression is suppressed in nanowires compared to nanoparticles. Past experimental data show that nanoscale tin platelets melt within a narrow range of 10 <sup>o</sup>C of the bulk melting temperature.<ref name=\"Allen\"/> The melting point depression of these platelets was suppressed compared to spherical tin nanoparticles.<ref name=\"Lai\"/>\n\n==Substrate==\n\nSeveral nanoparticle melting simulations theorize that the supporting substrate affects the extent of melting-point depression of a nanoparticle.<ref name=\"Jiang\"/><ref name=\"Couchman\">{{cite journal|author1=P. R. Couchman  |author2=W. A. Jesser  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Nature | volume = 269 | page = 481 | year = 1977| title =Thermodynamic theory of size dependence of melting temperature in metals | doi= 10.1038/269481a0 | issue=5628|bibcode = 1977Natur.269..481C }}</ref> These models account for energetic interactions between the substrate materials. A free nanoparticle, as many theoretical models assume, has a different melting temperature (usually lower) than a supported particle due to the absence cohesive energy between the nanoparticle and substrate. However, measurement of the properties of a freestanding nanoparticle remains impossible, so the extent of the interactions cannot be verified through experiment. Ultimately, substrates currently support nanoparticles for all nanoparticle applications, so substrate/nanoparticle interactions are always present and must impact melting point depression.\n\n==Solubility==\n\nWithin the size\u2013pressure approximation, which considers the stress induced by the surface tension and the curvature of the particle, it was shown that the size of the particle affects the composition and temperature of a eutectic point (Fe-C<ref name=\"Jiang\"/>) the solubility of C in Fe<ref name=\"Harutyunyan\">{{cite journal|author1=R.

During the mid-20th century it became a major metropolitan manufacturing and commercial area and [[conurbation]] of Greater Melbourne.  A [[Business district]], the former town centre, covers much of its area and is one of the largest in Greater Melbourne.\n\nIt is currently undergoing major [[Transit-oriented development|transit oriented]] [[urban renewal]], which was first planned in the [[Melbourne 2030]] strategy.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nPrior to the [[European settlement of Australia]], the flat to undulating land was densely forested with [[Eucalyptus|red gum]] and was inhabited by the [[Woiwurrung]] [[Indigenous Australian]] tribe.\n\nThe name is generally thought to be derived from the Woiwurrung word \"Tanjenong\" meaning \"lofty mountains\" possibly referring to the nearby Dandenong ranges.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cclc.vic.gov.au/history/topics/placenames.html#D |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722144246/http://www.cclc.vic.gov.au/history/topics/placenames.html#D |archive-date=22 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=5898&Title=Greater+Dandenong's+History |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102111008/http://greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=5898&Title=Greater+Dandenong%27s+History |archive-date=2 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother popular theory is that the name comes from 'bad flour', or 'no good damper'.

Dandenong Creek was first bridged in 1840. A road was made from Melbourne, making Dandenong, by the late 1850s, an important staging post for travellers into [[Gippsland]]. It became known as the 'gateway to Gippsland'. A township was surveyed in 1852. Milling of the [[River Red Gum|red gum]] timber became an important industry, and charcoal burning, tanning, quarrying and brick making also flourished. A livestock market was established in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=73&Title=Dandenong+History&Type=d |title=Dandenong History |accessdate=2007-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032227/http://www.greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=73&Title=Dandenong+History&Type=d |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Western Port Aboriginal Protectorate Station]] was located north-east of Dandenong from 1840 to 1844. This area had been an important meeting and ceremonial site for Aboriginal tribes. The [[Native Police Corps]] established its headquarters there until its disbandment in 1852. The [[Police Paddocks]] were then used for breeding and resting police horses.\n\nBy 1861, there were 40 houses in the township housing 193 people. In 1866, [[Dandenong Market]] commenced trading, selling  livestock, fruit, dairy products and other farm produce. Dandenong Shire was proclaimed in 1873. The Australian Handbook records the progress of the town by 1875.\n[[File:Dandenong post office.jpg|thumb|A view of the Dandenong Post Office at the start of the 20th century (now demolished).

The architects were Beswicke and Hutchins and the contractor McCullogh and McAlpine.

This caused the creation of several suburbs of Dandenong including the [[public housing]] estate of [[Doveton]].\n\nIn the 1950s, Melbourne rapidly expanded south east along the Princes Highway and Dandenong railway line to Dandenong and beyond and it became major metropolitan manufacturing and commercial area as industry extended into the outer suburbs. By the late 1960s, it was officially a suburban area of Melbourne and central Dandenong was transformed by modern buildings, with the redevelopment of the post office to a two-storey modern building in 1960 followed by a three-storey office development for AMP in 1966 and Dandenong Railway Station in 1975.<ref name=vicrail6283>{{cite book | author = Vincent Adams Winter | title = VR and VicRail: 1962 - 1983 | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-9592069-3-0 <!-- This is a corrected ISBN and may not match the number printed in the book. --> | page = 106 }}</ref>\n\n=== Urban renewal ===\n\n[[File:Dandenong plaza.jpg|thumb|Dandenong Plaza, Walker Street entrance]]\n\nDevelopment in Dandenong had [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] since the opening of the [[Dandenong Plaza]] shopping centre which resulted in the closure of many shops in the central business district.

These projects can be considered to be [[transit-oriented development]], where [[population density]] is intended to be higher compared to other areas with poorer access to transport.\n\nIn 2006, the Victorian Government committed $290 million towards the ''Revitalising Central Dandenong'' initiative, to transform central Dandenong into a vibrant and thriving economic and service hub. The State Government funding was spent on land acquisition and consolidation, delivery of infrastructure upgrades (Londsdale Street, Stockman's Bridge, Station precinct upgrades and public amenity) and facilitation of key catalyst projects such as the Australian Taxation Office, brand new Council Civic Centre and the State Government Services Hub.\n\nDandenong's redevelopment is undertaken by Development Victoria, a [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] agency responsible for urban renewal, in collaboration with the Greater Dandenong City Council.

At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, central Dandenong had a population of 29,906.<ref name=\"Australia Bureau of Statistics\"/>\n\nIt began as a township in 1852 and at the start of the 20th century was an important regional city with its own suburbs.  During the mid-20th century it became a major metropolitan manufacturing and commercial area and [[conurbation]] of Greater Melbourne.  A [[Business district]], the former town centre, covers much of its area and is one of the largest in Greater Melbourne.\n\nIt is currently undergoing major [[Transit-oriented development|transit oriented]] [[urban renewal]], which was first planned in the [[Melbourne 2030]] strategy.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nPrior to the [[European settlement of Australia]], the flat to undulating land was densely forested with [[Eucalyptus|red gum]] and was inhabited by the [[Woiwurrung]] [[Indigenous Australian]] tribe.\n\nThe name is generally thought to be derived from the Woiwurrung word \"Tanjenong\" meaning \"lofty mountains\" possibly referring to the nearby Dandenong ranges.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cclc.vic.gov.au/history/topics/placenames.html#D |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722144246/http://www.cclc.vic.gov.au/history/topics/placenames.html#D |archive-date=22 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=5898&Title=Greater+Dandenong's+History |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102111008/http://greaterdandenong.com/Documents.asp?ID=5898&Title=Greater+Dandenong%27s+History |archive-date=2 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother popular theory is that the name comes from 'bad flour', or 'no good damper'.

Dandenong Creek was first bridged in 1840. A road was made from Melbourne, making Dandenong, by the late 1850s, an important staging post for travellers into [[Gippsland]]. It became known as the 'gateway to Gippsland'. A township was surveyed in 1852. Milling of the [[River Red Gum|red gum]] timber became an important industry, and charcoal burning, tanning, quarrying and brick making also flourished.

The [[Police Paddocks]] were then used for breeding and resting police horses.\n\nBy 1861, there were 40 houses in the township housing 193 people. In 1866, [[Dandenong Market]] commenced trading, selling  livestock, fruit, dairy products and other farm produce. Dandenong Shire was proclaimed in 1873.

This caused the creation of several suburbs of Dandenong including the [[public housing]] estate of [[Doveton]].\n\nIn the 1950s, Melbourne rapidly expanded south east along the Princes Highway and Dandenong railway line to Dandenong and beyond and it became major metropolitan manufacturing and commercial area as industry extended into the outer suburbs. By the late 1960s, it was officially a suburban area of Melbourne and central Dandenong was transformed by modern buildings, with the redevelopment of the post office to a two-storey modern building in 1960 followed by a three-storey office development for AMP in 1966 and Dandenong Railway Station in 1975.<ref name=vicrail6283>{{cite book | author = Vincent Adams Winter | title = VR and VicRail: 1962 - 1983 | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-9592069-3-0 <!-- This is a corrected ISBN and may not match the number printed in the book. --> | page = 106 }}</ref>\n\n=== Urban renewal ===\n\n[[File:Dandenong plaza.jpg|thumb|Dandenong Plaza, Walker Street entrance]]\n\nDevelopment in Dandenong had [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] since the opening of the [[Dandenong Plaza]] shopping centre which resulted in the closure of many shops in the central business district.

The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis.

Following the 1967 elections, Indira gradually began to move towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders over a number of issues. Chief among them was her decision to support [[V. V.

The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalisation without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in party president [[S.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

The venue originally opened August 1994 near [[Port of Boston|Fan Pier]]. Due to land rights, the venue closed at the end of its season in 1998 and was relocated to its current location in South Boston, in 1999. The relocated amphitheater opened July 1999 and seats 5,200. The venue's season runs from May until September.\n\n==Name rights==\n* '''Harborlights Pavilion''' was the original name.  It was located at the site of the current US District Courthouse at Fan Pier.  It was moved a few hundred yards down the street when the courthouse was built.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kronenburg |first= |date=1996 |title=Portable Architecture |url= |location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] |publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]] |page= |isbn=0750623888|author-link= }}</ref>\n* '''Bank of Boston Pavilion'''.<ref>[http://www.bostonpavilion.net/ ''BostonPavilion.net'']</ref>\n* '''BankBoston Pavilion'''.
