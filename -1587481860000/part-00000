Lyrics include themes of patriotism, Nepali virtues, unity, love and nationalism. There is a lot of variety in the music of 1974&nbsp;AD. They have successfully tried various genres of music. Their songs, like \"Nepali,\" \"Sambodhan,\" \"Pahilo Junima,\" \"Parelima,\" \"Samjhi Baschu\" and \"Chudaina Timro Mayale\" and others, were some of the biggest hits in Nepalese music. The song \"Nepali Ho\" from their highest selling album Satabdi has been received as the most patriotic commercial song till date.\n\n== Formation (1994) ==\n\nThe group was formed during the 90s by a group of teachers from Gyanodaya School in [[Lalitpur, Nepal]]. The founding members were guitarist [[Phiroj Shyangden (Nepali Musician)|Phiroj Shyangden]], bassist Nirakar Yakthumba and drummer Bhanu A. During the early days the band played various genres for music like hard rock, heavy metal, rock and blues. Drummer Bhanu A was influenced by blues music. When they played cover tunes he sang Gary Moore numbers like \"Walking by Myself\". They played several gigs in and around Kathmandu where they covered numbers by Bryan Adams, Deep Purple and other rock groups. He is also a good guitarist and his bluesy rock style has inspired many guitarists in Nepal. His style has the flavor of guitarists like Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore and Eddie Van Halen. They mainly performed their own compositions. The hit tune is \"Mayaluleh\" from their debut album \"Time Out\", established 1974 AD as a household name. During this time, future members [[Adrian Pradhan]] and Sanjay Shreshta were involved with their own bands. Adrian used to be in a hard rock band from [[Kalimpong]] called \"The Flame\".\n\n\"The Flame\" held their first concert in Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu during the winter of 1994. They were basically a cover band doing songs from Iron Maiden, Metallica, Extreme, and other rock acts. Adrian Pradhan played rhythm guitar and performed vocals. The influence of early heavy metal can be heard in Adrian's singing style. Later during the late 90s Adrian joined 1974&nbsp;AD as their drummer/vocalist after former drummer Bhanu A went on hiatus. Percussionist Sanjay Shrestha, who used to play the drums for the St Xavier's school band, was involved with Nepali fusion rock act Shristi.\n\nFlute maestro Manoj Singh would soon join 1974&nbsp;AD and enjoy the popularity of the highly successful band and also contribute to the diversity of sound in the band.  During the late 90s local guitar enthusiast Manoj K.C from Dhobighat, Lalitpur joined 1974&nbsp;AD, completing the lineup.  Together they would form a solid act and go on to conquer the hearts of millions of die-hard fans.\n\n== Fame and fortune ==\n\nThe band was very popular in the Kathmandu and Lalitpur rock scene in mid 90s even before they started churning out big hits like \"Mayalule\" and other tunes. But the release of their debut album established them as a household name in Nepali music. Their compositions which includes \nlyrics on patriotism, self pride as a Nepali and love and unity amongst Nepali people are big hits in Nepali pop culture. They have come up with songs that has helped the nation unite and \nexpress the mutual feelings at times of big changes in country as in the form of political and other big events.

The band is currently on tour promoting the new songs.\n\n== Nirantarta - 1974ad Reunion with original members (2019-present) ==\n\nIn an event titled \u2018Nirantarta\u2019, held at Moksh, Jhamshikhel, Kathmandu, Nepal, on 8 July 2019, the band announced the reunion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/69206/|title=Original 1974AD members reunite|last=Poudel|first=Rahat|website=My City|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> with their original lineup, Phiroj Shyangden, Adrian Pradhan, Manoj Kumar KC, Nirakar Yakthumba and Sanjay Shrestha.

It evolved from the British [[Guy Fawkes Night]], which commemorates the failure of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605. Pope Night was most popular in the seaport towns of [[New England Colonies|New England]], especially in [[Boston]], where it was an occasion for drinking, rioting, and [[Anti Elitism|anti-elite]] protest by the [[working class]].\n\nGang violence became part of the tradition in the 1740s, with residents of different Boston neighborhoods battling for the honor of burning the pope's effigy. By the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards the [[American Revolution]] (1765-1783), the class rivalries of Pope Night gave way to [[anti-British sentiment]]. Under the leadership of Pope Night organizer [[Ebenezer Mackintosh]], Boston's [[North End, Boston|North]] and [[South End, Boston|South End]] gangs united in protest against the [[Stamp Act of 1765]]. \n\nLocal authorities made several attempts to crack down on the festivities. In 1775, to avoid offending Canadian allies, [[George Washington]] issued a statement forbidding any troops under his command from participating. The last known Pope Night celebration in Boston took place in 1776, though the tradition continued in other towns well into the 19th century.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known celebration of Pope Night took place on November 5, 1623, in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. A group of sailors built a bonfire, which raged out of control and destroyed several nearby homes. By the late 17th century, annual festivities on November 5 were a New England tradition. Major celebrations were held in Boston, [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]], [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. In 1702, locals in Marblehead held a [[bull-baiting]] and distributed the meat to the poor.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}}\n\n=== Mid-18th century ===\n\nOver the years the celebration became more elaborate. By the 1720s, simple bonfires had been replaced with parades in which effigies of [[the Pope]] and [[the Devil]] were carried through the streets on a platform before being burned.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}} The celebrants came from what were called the \"lower orders\" of society: sailors, laborers, apprentices, lesser artisans, servants, and African-American [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. Active participants were all males; there is no record of any females taking part except as spectators.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=23}} \n\nPope Night was celebrated the most consistently and boisterously in Boston, due in part to the large number of sailors there.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}} In the 18th century, sailors occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder; many were criminals, deserted soldiers, and runaway slaves. As a major seaport, Boston had a large contingent of maritime workers for whom a night of drinking, fighting, and insulting the [[elites]] had great appeal.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=23}} Pope Night gave the common people a chance to express their dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] on the pretext of condemning [[popery]]. The boisterous and often violent festivities were permitted only because the anti-papal theme made them acceptable to the [[ruling class]].{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nAt least two fatal accidents occurred on Pope Night, possibly due to heavy drinking. In 1735, four apprentices drowned while canoeing home from [[Boston Neck]] after the bonfire.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=17}} In 1764, a carriage bearing an effigy of the pope ran over a boy's head, killing him instantly.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}}  \n\n=== Riot acts ===\n\nBoston's elites were appalled by the increasingly rowdy festivities. One resident, complaining to a local newspaper in 1745, referred to the revelers as \"rude and intoxicated Rabble, the very Dregs of the People, black and white\", and urged the authorities to crack down.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=45}} \n\nIn 1748, the Justices of the Peace announced that \"whereas sundry persons have heretofore gone about the streets ... armed wh. clubs & demanding money of ye inhabitants and breaking ye windows of ye who refuse it\", they planned to send out constables to keep the peace. Similar notices were published over the next four years, to no avail. In 1753 the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] passed an act forbidding \"all riotous, tumultuous and disorderly Assemblies\" from \"carrying pageants and other shews through the streets and lanes of the town of Boston and other towns of this province, abusing and insulting the inhabitants\". The court passed similar acts in 1756, 1758, 1763, and 1769, but the locals were determined to have their fun.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=20-21}} \n\nThe 1769 Riot Act imposed penalties for [[Extortion|shaking down]] wealthy residents:\n\n{{quote|Be it enacted, That if any Persons being more than three in Number, and being armed all or either of them with Sticks, Clubs, or any kind of Weapons, or disguised with Vizards (so-called) or painted or discolored Faces, or being in any other Manner disguised shall assemble together having Imagery or Pageantry for a public Shew, Shall by Menaces of otherwise exact, require, demand, or ask, any Money or other Thing of Value from any of the Inhabitants or other Person in the Streets, Lanes, of any Town within this Province ... shall for each Offense forfeit and pay the Sum of Forty Shillings, or suffer imprisonment not exceeding one month; or if the Offender shall be a Negro Servant, he may be whipped not exceeding Ten Stripes.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=49}}}}\n\nAuthorities apparently could not rely on the militia to keep order on Pope Night. A possible explanation is that the militiamen themselves were among the revelers. Local militiamen participated in the market riot of 1737 and the [[Knowles Riot]] of 1747, and instigated the [[Montgomery Guards]] Riot of 1837.{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=35, 70, 123}} Following an accident on Pope Night in 1764 in which a boy was killed, the \"Sheriff, Justices, and Officers of the Militia\" were ordered to destroy the North and South End popes, but were unable to control the crowd, which numbered in the thousands.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}} No mention is made of the militia's rank and file.\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nThe passing of the Stamp Act in March 1765 caused a good deal of unrest in the American colonies. The [[Sons of Liberty]] were a leading group of American dissidents at this time. The [[Loyal Nine]], a group of nine area businessmen, led the Sons of Liberty and were a link between the common people and wealthier classes.{{sfn|Day|Day|1971|p=38}} That summer the Loyal Nine arranged the unification of the North and South End mobs. On Pope Night 1765, townspeople held a \"Union Feast\", with a single procession led jointly by the South End mob leader, Ebenezer Mackintosh, and the North End leader, Samuel Swift.{{sfn|Hindus|1971|p=60}} The two mobs stopped battling each other, and Mackintosh became the leader of the united group.{{sfn|Davidson|1932|p=38}} [[John Hancock]] and other patriot merchants provided them with food, drink, and supplies. In author Alfred Young's view, Pope Night provided the \"scaffolding, symbolism, and leadership\" for resistance to the Stamp Act in 1764\u201365.{{sfn|Young|2001|p=94}}\n\nThe passage in 1774 of the [[Quebec Act]], which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing \"Popish principles and French law\".{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=99}} Such fears were bolstered by opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Night.{{sfn|Fuchs|1990|p=36}} Commenting in 1775, [[George Washington]] was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|p=145}}\n\n{{quote|As the Commander in Chief has been apprized of a design form'd for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the Effigy of the pope\u2014He cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be Officers and Soldiers in this army so void of common sense, as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this Juncture; at a Time when we are solliciting, and have really obtain'd, the friendship and alliance of the people of Canada, whom we ought to consider as Brethren embarked in the same Cause. The defence of the general Liberty of America: At such a juncture, and in such Circumstances, to be insulting their Religion, is so monstrous, as not to be suffered or excused; indeed instead of offering the most remote insult, it is our duty to address public thanks to these our Brethren, as to them we are so much indebted for every late happy Success over the common Enemy in Canada.{{sfn|Washington|1776|p=65}}}}\n\nGenerally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Night, although according to the [[Bostonian Society]] some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776.{{sfn|Bostonian Society|2010}} Sherwood Collins argues that the tradition ended in Boston at this time not only because of Washington's order, but because most of the celebrants were likely [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] who did not stay in Boston while it was held by the British; and, moreover, because it celebrated the failure of a plot against the British king and Parliament, who were now the enemy.{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=404}}\n\nThe tradition continued in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] as late as 1817,{{sfn|Berlant|1991|p=232}} and was still observed in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], in 1892.{{sfn|Albee|1892|pp=335-336}} In the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around [[New York City|New York]], stacks of barrels were burnt on [[Election Day (United States)|election day]] eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.{{sfn|Eggleston|1885|p=400}}\n\n== Festivities ==\n\nAt the height of its popularity, Pope Night in Boston was a three-part ritual consisting of a procession in which effigies of the Pope and other figures were paraded through the streets; a battle between the processions from the North and South Ends; and the burning of the effigies by the victors. Locals would spend weeks preparing their effigies for the celebration. The processions were organized by elected officers who, unlike traditional political leaders, came from the lower classes. One such leader was Ebenezer Mackintosh of the South End, a shoemaker who was also the town's official sealer of leather.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} \n\n=== Procession ===\n\nThe procession was led by young boys who carried small effigies of the pope.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} According to a 1768 broadsheet sold by the \"Printers Boys in Boston\": \n\n<blockquote><poem>The little Popes, they go out First,\n::With little teney Boys:\nIn Frolicks they are full of Gale\n::And laughing make a Noise.{{sfn|Printers Boys|1768}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe boys carved the heads of their \"popes\" from potatoes, and mounted the effigies on shingles or boards, some small enough for a single boy to carry in his hands, others requiring two or three boys to carry through the streets.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} During the day they went door to door with their popes, demanding tributes from the neighbors in a tradition very similar to [[trick-or-treating]].{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=409}}\n\nNext came the large effigies, which were mounted on wheeled platforms, like [[parade floats]]. The publisher [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], who took part in the Pope Night celebrations as a child in the 1750s and 60s, described the floats in his memoir:\n\n{{quote|On the front of these stages, was placed ... a large lantern framed circular at the top and covered with paper. Behind his lantern was placed an effigy of the pope sitting in an armed Chair. Immediately behind him was the imaginary representation of the Devil, standing Erect with extended arms. ...The large Effigies had heads placed on poles which went thro' the bodies & thro' the upper part of the stages which were formed like large boxes, some of them not less than 16 or 18 feet long, 3 or 4 feet wide and 3 or 4 feet in depth. Inside of the Stages and out of sight sat a boy under each effigy whose business it was to move the heads of the Effigies by means of the poles ... from one side to the other as fancy directed.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nThe effigies' heads could also be raised, appearing to peek into second-story windows of nearby houses.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}} The crowd shouted insults at the figures as they passed:\n\n{{quote|<poem>The great Ones next go out, and meet\n::With many a Smart Rebuf:\nThey're hall'd along from Street to Street\n::And call'd hard Names enough.{{sfn|Printers Boys|1768}}</poem>}}\n\nThe floats were typically about ten to twelve feet long,{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=407}} although there are accounts of much larger ones. One float in Newburyport was forty feet long, and so heavy it had to be drawn by several horses; it carried additional effigies of monks and friars as well as several dancers and fiddlers. In Boston, the floats were pulled through the narrow, winding streets by men and boys.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=19}} During the 1760s, when Ebenezer Mackintosh was in charge of the South End procession, he would march ahead of the float, dressed in a blue and gold uniform with a lace hat, carrying a [[speaking trumpet]]. Besides being festive, the gaudy uniform was intended as a mockery of Boston's elites.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nThe \"pope\" was dressed in ornate, antiquated garb, and had an exaggerated [[Roman nose]]. Behind him, the Devil was coated with tar and feathers, and stood holding a key in one hand and a pitchfork in the other.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} After 1701, the display also included an effigy of the exiled Catholic prince [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], nicknamed the \"Old Pretender\",{{sfn|Longley|1933|p=101}} sometimes on a [[gibbet]].{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=46}} Boys dressed up as devils and danced around the figures. The display reflected the prevailing belief among New England Protestants that Catholics were in league with the devil.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} The effigy pope's aristocratic appearance was also symbolic. Dressed in \"gorgeous attire\" with a large white wig and an enormous gold lace hat, the pope became a symbol of wealth as well as popery.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nDuring the procession, masked and costumed revelers would stop at the homes of wealthy residents and threaten to break their windows unless they contributed funds for the festivities.{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=41, 47}} Sometimes they broke the windows just for fun, even after the owner had made a generous donation.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=48}} In Boston there were usually two processions, one from the North End and the other from the South End. According to [[John Rowe (merchant)|John Rowe]] (the Boston merchant for whom [[Rowes Wharf]] is named), there were three processions in 1766.{{sfn|Howe|1910|pp=23-24}} \n\nHistorian Francis Cogliano calls it a \"wonderful irony\" that the anti-papal processions in the colonies were so similar to the [[Carnival]] celebrations in Catholic Europe. Both celebrations gave the lower classes a chance to act out in a disorderly and aggressive fashion, intimidating the elites.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=21-22}} Historian Jack Tager likens the street pageantry to European [[Mummers play|mummery]] or [[:wikt:charivari|charivari]].{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=45}}\n\n=== Battle between the North and South Ends ===\n\nBy the mid-18th century, violence had become an established part of the Pope Night tradition in Boston. When the North and South End processions met, they fought a street battle with each group trying to capture the other's pope. The fighters attacked each other with clubs and [[:wikt:brickbat|brickbats]], often resulting in serious injuries and even death. The publisher [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]] recalled in his memoir that \"altho' persons were seldom killed, yet broken heads were not infrequent\". As a boy, Thomas himself was nearly killed one Pope Night when he was hit in the head with a brickbat.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=20}} Another resident complained to the ''[[Boston Evening Post]]'' in 1745:\n\n{{quote|The rudest and lowest Sailors out of Boston ... fall upon one another with Clubs and Cutlasses, in a Rage and Fury which only Hell could inspire. ...What Madness must seize the two Mobs, united Brethren, even as they would appear against Popery, to fall upon each other, break each other's Bones, or dash one another's Brains out!{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=48-49}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nIn 1752, a sailor named John Crabb was clubbed to death on Pope Night by Thomas Chubb also a sailor, and a slave named Abraham. Chubb was branded on the hand and sentenced to a year in prison for his part in the killing; it is not known what happened to Abraham.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=20}}\n\n=== Bonfire ===\n\nThe location of the bonfire varied from year to year.

It evolved from the British [[Guy Fawkes Night]], which commemorates the failure of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605. Pope Night was most popular in the seaport towns of [[New England Colonies|New England]], especially in [[Boston]], where it was an occasion for drinking, rioting, and [[Anti Elitism|anti-elite]] protest by the [[working class]].\n\nGang violence became part of the tradition in the 1740s, with residents of different Boston neighborhoods battling for the honor of burning the pope's effigy. By the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards the [[American Revolution]] (1765-1783), the class rivalries of Pope Night gave way to [[anti-British sentiment]]. Under the leadership of Pope Night organizer [[Ebenezer Mackintosh]], Boston's [[North End, Boston|North]] and [[South End, Boston|South End]] gangs united in protest against the [[Stamp Act of 1765]]. \n\nLocal authorities made several attempts to crack down on the festivities. In 1775, to avoid offending Canadian allies, [[George Washington]] issued a statement forbidding any troops under his command from participating. The last known Pope Night celebration in Boston took place in 1776, though the tradition continued in other towns well into the 19th century.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known celebration of Pope Night took place on November 5, 1623, in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. A group of sailors built a bonfire, which raged out of control and destroyed several nearby homes. By the late 17th century, annual festivities on November 5 were a New England tradition. Major celebrations were held in Boston, [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]], [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. In 1702, locals in Marblehead held a [[bull-baiting]] and distributed the meat to the poor.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}}\n\n=== Mid-18th century ===\n\nOver the years the celebration became more elaborate. By the 1720s, simple bonfires had been replaced with parades in which effigies of [[the Pope]] and [[the Devil]] were carried through the streets on a platform before being burned.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}} The celebrants came from what were called the \"lower orders\" of society: sailors, laborers, apprentices, lesser artisans, servants, and African-American [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. Active participants were all males; there is no record of any females taking part except as spectators.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=23}} \n\nPope Night was celebrated the most consistently and boisterously in Boston, due in part to the large number of sailors there.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=16}} In the 18th century, sailors occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder; many were criminals, deserted soldiers, and runaway slaves. As a major seaport, Boston had a large contingent of maritime workers for whom a night of drinking, fighting, and insulting the [[elites]] had great appeal.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=23}} Pope Night gave the common people a chance to express their dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] on the pretext of condemning [[popery]]. The boisterous and often violent festivities were permitted only because the anti-papal theme made them acceptable to the [[ruling class]].{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nAt least two fatal accidents occurred on Pope Night, possibly due to heavy drinking. In 1735, four apprentices drowned while canoeing home from [[Boston Neck]] after the bonfire.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=17}} In 1764, a carriage bearing an effigy of the pope ran over a boy's head, killing him instantly.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}}  \n\n=== Riot acts ===\n\nBoston's elites were appalled by the increasingly rowdy festivities. One resident, complaining to a local newspaper in 1745, referred to the revelers as \"rude and intoxicated Rabble, the very Dregs of the People, black and white\", and urged the authorities to crack down.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=45}} \n\nIn 1748, the Justices of the Peace announced that \"whereas sundry persons have heretofore gone about the streets ... armed wh. clubs & demanding money of ye inhabitants and breaking ye windows of ye who refuse it\", they planned to send out constables to keep the peace. Similar notices were published over the next four years, to no avail. In 1753 the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] passed an act forbidding \"all riotous, tumultuous and disorderly Assemblies\" from \"carrying pageants and other shews through the streets and lanes of the town of Boston and other towns of this province, abusing and insulting the inhabitants\". The court passed similar acts in 1756, 1758, 1763, and 1769, but the locals were determined to have their fun.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=20-21}} \n\nThe 1769 Riot Act imposed penalties for [[Extortion|shaking down]] wealthy residents:\n\n{{quote|Be it enacted, That if any Persons being more than three in Number, and being armed all or either of them with Sticks, Clubs, or any kind of Weapons, or disguised with Vizards (so-called) or painted or discolored Faces, or being in any other Manner disguised shall assemble together having Imagery or Pageantry for a public Shew, Shall by Menaces of otherwise exact, require, demand, or ask, any Money or other Thing of Value from any of the Inhabitants or other Person in the Streets, Lanes, of any Town within this Province ... shall for each Offense forfeit and pay the Sum of Forty Shillings, or suffer imprisonment not exceeding one month; or if the Offender shall be a Negro Servant, he may be whipped not exceeding Ten Stripes.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=49}}}}\n\nAuthorities apparently could not rely on the militia to keep order on Pope Night. A possible explanation is that the militiamen themselves were among the revelers. Local militiamen participated in the market riot of 1737 and the [[Knowles Riot]] of 1747, and instigated the [[Montgomery Guards]] Riot of 1837.{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=35, 70, 123}} Following an accident on Pope Night in 1764 in which a boy was killed, the \"Sheriff, Justices, and Officers of the Militia\" were ordered to destroy the North and South End popes, but were unable to control the crowd, which numbered in the thousands.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}} No mention is made of the militia's rank and file.\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nThe passing of the Stamp Act in March 1765 caused a good deal of unrest in the American colonies. The [[Sons of Liberty]] were a leading group of American dissidents at this time. The [[Loyal Nine]], a group of nine area businessmen, led the Sons of Liberty and were a link between the common people and wealthier classes.{{sfn|Day|Day|1971|p=38}} That summer the Loyal Nine arranged the unification of the North and South End mobs. On Pope Night 1765, townspeople held a \"Union Feast\", with a single procession led jointly by the South End mob leader, Ebenezer Mackintosh, and the North End leader, Samuel Swift.{{sfn|Hindus|1971|p=60}} The two mobs stopped battling each other, and Mackintosh became the leader of the united group.{{sfn|Davidson|1932|p=38}} [[John Hancock]] and other patriot merchants provided them with food, drink, and supplies. In author Alfred Young's view, Pope Night provided the \"scaffolding, symbolism, and leadership\" for resistance to the Stamp Act in 1764\u201365.{{sfn|Young|2001|p=94}}\n\nThe passage in 1774 of the [[Quebec Act]], which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing \"Popish principles and French law\".{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=99}} Such fears were bolstered by opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Night.{{sfn|Fuchs|1990|p=36}} Commenting in 1775, [[George Washington]] was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|p=145}}\n\n{{quote|As the Commander in Chief has been apprized of a design form'd for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the Effigy of the pope\u2014He cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be Officers and Soldiers in this army so void of common sense, as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this Juncture; at a Time when we are solliciting, and have really obtain'd, the friendship and alliance of the people of Canada, whom we ought to consider as Brethren embarked in the same Cause. The defence of the general Liberty of America: At such a juncture, and in such Circumstances, to be insulting their Religion, is so monstrous, as not to be suffered or excused; indeed instead of offering the most remote insult, it is our duty to address public thanks to these our Brethren, as to them we are so much indebted for every late happy Success over the common Enemy in Canada.{{sfn|Washington|1776|p=65}}}}\n\nGenerally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Night, although according to the [[Bostonian Society]] some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776.{{sfn|Bostonian Society|2010}} Sherwood Collins argues that the tradition ended in Boston at this time not only because of Washington's order, but because most of the celebrants were likely [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] who did not stay in Boston while it was held by the British; and, moreover, because it celebrated the failure of a plot against the British king and Parliament, who were now the enemy.{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=404}}\n\nThe tradition continued in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] as late as 1817,{{sfn|Berlant|1991|p=232}} and was still observed in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], in 1892.{{sfn|Albee|1892|pp=335-336}} In the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around [[New York City|New York]], stacks of barrels were burnt on [[Election Day (United States)|election day]] eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.{{sfn|Eggleston|1885|p=400}}\n\n== Festivities ==\n\nAt the height of its popularity, Pope Night in Boston was a three-part ritual consisting of a procession in which effigies of the Pope and other figures were paraded through the streets; a battle between the processions from the North and South Ends; and the burning of the effigies by the victors. Locals would spend weeks preparing their effigies for the celebration. The processions were organized by elected officers who, unlike traditional political leaders, came from the lower classes. One such leader was Ebenezer Mackintosh of the South End, a shoemaker who was also the town's official sealer of leather.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} \n\n=== Procession ===\n\nThe procession was led by young boys who carried small effigies of the pope.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} According to a 1768 broadsheet sold by the \"Printers Boys in Boston\": \n\n<blockquote><poem>The little Popes, they go out First,\n::With little teney Boys:\nIn Frolicks they are full of Gale\n::And laughing make a Noise.{{sfn|Printers Boys|1768}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe boys carved the heads of their \"popes\" from potatoes, and mounted the effigies on shingles or boards, some small enough for a single boy to carry in his hands, others requiring two or three boys to carry through the streets.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} During the day they went door to door with their popes, demanding tributes from the neighbors in a tradition very similar to [[trick-or-treating]].{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=409}}\n\nNext came the large effigies, which were mounted on wheeled platforms, like [[parade floats]]. The publisher [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], who took part in the Pope Night celebrations as a child in the 1750s and 60s, described the floats in his memoir:\n\n{{quote|On the front of these stages, was placed ... a large lantern framed circular at the top and covered with paper. Behind his lantern was placed an effigy of the pope sitting in an armed Chair. Immediately behind him was the imaginary representation of the Devil, standing Erect with extended arms. ...The large Effigies had heads placed on poles which went thro' the bodies & thro' the upper part of the stages which were formed like large boxes, some of them not less than 16 or 18 feet long, 3 or 4 feet wide and 3 or 4 feet in depth. Inside of the Stages and out of sight sat a boy under each effigy whose business it was to move the heads of the Effigies by means of the poles ... from one side to the other as fancy directed.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nThe effigies' heads could also be raised, appearing to peek into second-story windows of nearby houses.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=47}} The crowd shouted insults at the figures as they passed:\n\n{{quote|<poem>The great Ones next go out, and meet\n::With many a Smart Rebuf:\nThey're hall'd along from Street to Street\n::And call'd hard Names enough.{{sfn|Printers Boys|1768}}</poem>}}\n\nThe floats were typically about ten to twelve feet long,{{sfn|Collins|1973|p=407}} although there are accounts of much larger ones. One float in Newburyport was forty feet long, and so heavy it had to be drawn by several horses; it carried additional effigies of monks and friars as well as several dancers and fiddlers. In Boston, the floats were pulled through the narrow, winding streets by men and boys.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=19}} During the 1760s, when Ebenezer Mackintosh was in charge of the South End procession, he would march ahead of the float, dressed in a blue and gold uniform with a lace hat, carrying a [[speaking trumpet]]. Besides being festive, the gaudy uniform was intended as a mockery of Boston's elites.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nThe \"pope\" was dressed in ornate, antiquated garb, and had an exaggerated [[Roman nose]]. Behind him, the Devil was coated with tar and feathers, and stood holding a key in one hand and a pitchfork in the other.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} After 1701, the display also included an effigy of the exiled Catholic prince [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], nicknamed the \"Old Pretender\",{{sfn|Longley|1933|p=101}} sometimes on a [[gibbet]].{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=46}} Boys dressed up as devils and danced around the figures. The display reflected the prevailing belief among New England Protestants that Catholics were in league with the devil.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=17-18}} The effigy pope's aristocratic appearance was also symbolic. Dressed in \"gorgeous attire\" with a large white wig and an enormous gold lace hat, the pope became a symbol of wealth as well as popery.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=24}}\n\nDuring the procession, masked and costumed revelers would stop at the homes of wealthy residents and threaten to break their windows unless they contributed funds for the festivities.{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=41, 47}} Sometimes they broke the windows just for fun, even after the owner had made a generous donation.{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=48}} In Boston there were usually two processions, one from the North End and the other from the South End. According to [[John Rowe (merchant)|John Rowe]] (the Boston merchant for whom [[Rowes Wharf]] is named), there were three processions in 1766.{{sfn|Howe|1910|pp=23-24}} \n\nHistorian Francis Cogliano calls it a \"wonderful irony\" that the anti-papal processions in the colonies were so similar to the [[Carnival]] celebrations in Catholic Europe. Both celebrations gave the lower classes a chance to act out in a disorderly and aggressive fashion, intimidating the elites.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|pp=21-22}} Historian Jack Tager likens the street pageantry to European [[Mummers play|mummery]] or [[:wikt:charivari|charivari]].{{sfn|Tager|2001|p=45}}\n\n=== Battle between the North and South Ends ===\n\nBy the mid-18th century, violence had become an established part of the Pope Night tradition in Boston. When the North and South End processions met, they fought a street battle with each group trying to capture the other's pope. The fighters attacked each other with clubs and [[:wikt:brickbat|brickbats]], often resulting in serious injuries and even death. The publisher [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]] recalled in his memoir that \"altho' persons were seldom killed, yet broken heads were not infrequent\". As a boy, Thomas himself was nearly killed one Pope Night when he was hit in the head with a brickbat.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=20}} Another resident complained to the ''[[Boston Evening Post]]'' in 1745:\n\n{{quote|The rudest and lowest Sailors out of Boston ... fall upon one another with Clubs and Cutlasses, in a Rage and Fury which only Hell could inspire ... what Madness must seize the two Mobs, united Brethren, even as they would appear against Popery, to fall upon each other, break each other's Bones, or dash one another's Brains out!{{sfn|Tager|2001|pp=48-49}}}}\n\nIn 1752, a sailor named John Crabb was clubbed to death on Pope Night by Thomas Chubb, also a sailor, and a slave named Abraham. Chubb was branded on the hand and sentenced to a year in prison for his part in the killing; it is not known what happened to Abraham.{{sfn|Cogliano|1993|p=20}}\n\n=== Bonfire ===\n\nThe location of the bonfire varied from year to year. If the North End won the battle, the effigies were burned in a bonfire on [[Copp's Hill]]; if the South End won, the effigies were burned on [[Boston Common]].{{sfn|Howe|1910|pp=23-24}}\n\nIn addition to the Devil, the Pope, the Pretender, and Guy Fawkes, effigies of prominent contemporary figures were often burned on Pope Night.

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery grant]] to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.\n\nIt is the only cemetery in the country to be owned by the [[Crown property|Crown]].<ref>[https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton-cemetery/about-brompton-cemetery having been originally established by a private company the cemetery is now the property of the Crown</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Charles Booth 1889 map - detail showing Lillie Bridge.png|thumb|Charles Booth 1889 map \u2013 detail showing Brompton Cemetery]]\nBrompton Cemetery is adjacent to [[West Brompton station]] in west London, England. The main entrance is at North Lodge, Old Brompton Road in [[West Brompton]], [[SW postcode area|SW5]], in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]. There is another entrance at South Lodge, located on the [[Fulham Road]], [[SW postcode area|SW10]] near the junction with [[Redcliffe Gardens]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery Chapel 09.JPG|thumb|right|Brompton Cemetery Chapel]]\n[[File:Tomb of Frederick Richards Leyland 03.JPG|thumb|Tomb of [[Frederick Richards Leyland]] (the only Grade II* funerary monument in Brompton Cemetery)]]\n[[File:The soldier's section, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The military section, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery - geograph.org.uk - 313288.jpg|thumb|Main avenue]]\n[[File:Outer east section, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Outer east section, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Colonnade, Brompton Cemetery, London.JPG|thumb|Colonnade, Brompton Cemetery, London]]\n[[File:Central roundel, Brompton Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Central roundel, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery, London 98.JPG|thumb|Emmeline Pankhurst's grave]]\n[[File:Brompton Cemetery, London 105.JPG|thumb|angels, Brompton Cemetery]]\n[[File:Valentine Prinsep Monument Brompton.jpg|thumb|right|Monument of [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep]]]]\n[[File:Nellie Farren Grave Brompton.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of [[Nellie Farren]]]]\n\nBy the early years of the 19th century, inner city burial grounds, mostly churchyards, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery. The [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the [[Brigade of the Guards]] has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of [[World War I]] and 79 of [[World War II]], whose graves are registered and maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. A number of veterans are listed in the Notable Interments.<ref name=cwgc>{{cite web|author=r |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2040195/BROMPTON%20CEMETERY |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Although the majority of war graves are in the dedicated railed section to the west \u2013 also containing 19th century services graves \u2013 a number of servicemen's graves are scattered in other areas.

Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5&nbsp;mph limit. The [[byelaws]] are displayed on boards at both entrances.\nThe Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org|title=The Friends of Brompton Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe cemetery has a reputation for being a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising ground]] for gay men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qxmagazine.com/pdf/gayhistory-west.pdf|title=Go west, young man|work=QX Magazine International|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==A connection with Beatrix Potter==\n[[Image:Nutkins 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nutkins gravestone]]\n\n[[Beatrix Potter]], who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery.

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery grant]] to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.\n\nIt is the only cemetery in the country to be owned by the [[Crown property|Crown]].<ref>[https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton-cemetery/about-brompton-cemetery having been originally established by a private company the cemetery is now the property of the Crown</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Charles Booth 1889 map - detail showing Lillie Bridge.png|thumb|Charles Booth 1889 map \u2013 detail showing Brompton Cemetery]]\nBrompton Cemetery is adjacent to [[West Brompton station]] in west London, England.

In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery.

Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5&nbsp;mph limit. The [[byelaws]] are displayed on boards at both entrances.\nThe Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org|title=The Friends of Brompton Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe cemetery has a reputation for being a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising ground]] for gay men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qxmagazine.com/pdf/gayhistory-west.pdf|title=Go west, young man|work=QX Magazine International|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==A connection with Beatrix Potter==\n[[Image:Nutkins 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nutkins gravestone]]\n\n[[Beatrix Potter]], who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery.

The current Programmes at the Sanger Institute are Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation, Cellular Genetics, Human Genetics, Parasites and Microbes and Tree of Life. Studies from all programmes provide insights into human, pathogen, cellular evolution, the phenotypic and hence biological consequences of genome variation and the processes which cause mutations.\n\n===Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme===\nProvides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development. This Programme includes the [[Cancer Genome Project]].\n\n===Cellular Genetics Programme===\nExplores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international [[Human Cell Atlas]] initiative.\n\n===Human Genetics Programme===\nThe Institute's research in [[human genetics]] focuses on the characterisation of [[human genetic variation]] in health and disease. Aside from the Institute's contribution to the [[Human Genome Project]], researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary genetics]]. In January 2008, the launch of the [[1000 Genomes Project]], a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the \"most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1000genomes.org/page.php|title=1000 Genomes: A Deep Catalog of Human Genetic Variation|publisher=1000 Genomes Project|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2010/100621.html|title=1000 Genomes Project releases data from pilot projects on path to providing database for 2,500 human genomes|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project,<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24424120\n| pmc = 4026295\n| year = 2014\n| last1 = Kaye\n| first1 = J\n| title = Managing clinically significant findings in research: The UK10K example\n| journal = European Journal of Human Genetics\n| volume = 22\n| issue = 9\n| pages = 1100\u20134\n| last2 = Hurles\n| first2 = M\n| last3 = Griffin\n| first3 = H\n| last4 = Grewal\n| first4 = J\n| last5 = Bobrow\n| first5 = M | authorlink5 = Martin Bobrow\n| last6 = Timpson\n| first6 = N\n| last7 = Smee\n| first7 = C\n| last8 = Bolton\n| first8 = P\n| last9 = Durbin\n| first9 = R | authorlink9 = Richard M.

The current Programmes at the Sanger Institute are Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation, Cellular Genetics, Human Genetics, Parasites and Microbes and Tree of Life. Studies from all programmes provide insights into human, pathogen, cellular evolution, the phenotypic and hence biological consequences of genome variation and the processes which cause mutations.\n\n===Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme===\nProvides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development. This Programme includes the [[Cancer Genome Project]].\n\n===Cellular Genetics Programme===\nExplores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international [[Human Cell Atlas]] initiative.\n\n===Human Genetics Programme===\nThe Institute's research in [[human genetics]] focuses on the characterisation of [[human genetic variation]] in health and disease. Aside from the Institute's contribution to the [[Human Genome Project]], researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary genetics]]. In January 2008, the launch of the [[1000 Genomes Project]], a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the \"most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1000genomes.org/page.php|title=1000 Genomes: A Deep Catalog of Human Genetic Variation|publisher=1000 Genomes Project|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2010/100621.html|title=1000 Genomes Project releases data from pilot projects on path to providing database for 2,500 human genomes|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project,<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24424120\n| pmc = 4026295\n| year = 2014\n| last1 = Kaye\n| first1 = J\n| title = Managing clinically significant findings in research: The UK10K example\n| journal = European Journal of Human Genetics\n| volume = 22\n| issue = 9\n| pages = 1100\u20134\n| last2 = Hurles\n| first2 = M\n| last3 = Griffin\n| first3 = H\n| last4 = Grewal\n| first4 = J\n| last5 = Bobrow\n| first5 = M | authorlink5 = Martin Bobrow\n| last6 = Timpson\n| first6 = N\n| last7 = Smee\n| first7 = C\n| last8 = Bolton\n| first8 = P\n| last9 = Durbin\n| first9 = R | authorlink9 = Richard M.

It also models developmental disorders to explore which physical aspects might be reversible.\n\n===Pathogens and Microbes Programme===\nInvestigates the common underpinning mechanisms of evolution, infection and resistance to therapy into bolster understanding of [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[parasitism|parasites]], with a particular interest in [[malaria]]. It also explores the effects of genome variation on the biology of [[host (biology)|host]]-[[pathogen]] interactions, in particular host response to infection and the role of microiotia in health and disease. All the genomes after sequencing are made available at the web-based onsite-maintained database, GeneDB.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Tree of Life Programme ===\nThe Tree of Life Programme was created in 2019 to investigate the diversity of complex organisms found in the UK through sequencing and cellular technologies. It also compares and contrasts species' genome sequences to unlock insights into evolution and conservation. This Programme will play a leading role in the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a UK-wide initiative to sequence the genomes of all 66,000 complex species (eukaryotes) in the British Isles.\n\n===Collaborations===\nMuch of the Sanger Institute's research is carried out in partnership with the wider [[scientific community]]; over 90 percent of the Institute's research papers involve collaborations with other organisations.<ref>Figure based on data for 2008 retrieved from SCOPUS website</ref> Significant collaborations include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[1000 Genomes Project]]\n* [[GENCODE]] and [[ENCODE]] (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements)\n* [[International Cancer Genome Consortium]]\n* [[International HapMap Project]]<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = - | first1 = -| last2 = Gibbs | first2 = R.

A new attempt led to the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian [[Serbian campaign of World War I#1915|conquest of Serbia]] and [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegro]]. That led to the Serbian army to [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat through Albania]] and to be evacuated to [[Salonika]] by the Allies. There, they joined with the Franco-British [[Allied Army of the Orient]] and fought a protracted [[trench war]] against Bulgarian forces on the [[Macedonian front]]. The allied army was stationed in Greece, which resulted in the [[National Schism]] on whether Greece should join the Allies or remain neutral, which would benefit the Central Powers. Greece eventually joined the Allies in 1917. In September 1918, the [[Vardar Offensive]] broke through the lines of Bulgaria, which was [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|forced to surrender]], leading to the [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro]].\n\n==Overview==\nA major cause of the war was the hostility between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, which made some of the earliest fighting take place between them. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.\n\n[[Dalmatia]] was a strategic region during the war that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war upon agreeing to the [[Treaty of London, 1915]], which guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.\n\nIn 1917, Greece entered the war for the Allieds, and in 1918, the multinational [[Allied Army of the Orient]], based in northern [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], finally launched an offensive, which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and halted only at the border of [[Hungary]] in November 1918.\n\n==Serbian\u2013Montenegrin campaign==\n{{Main|Serbian campaign of World War I|Montenegrin Campaign of World War I}}\n\nThe Serbian army managed to rebuff the larger [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] because Russia assisted by invading from the north. In 1915, Austro-Hungary placed additional soldiers in the south front and succeed in engaging Bulgaria as an ally.\n\nSoon, the Serbian army was attacked from the north and the east, forcing a [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat to Greece]]. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful, and the Serbian army remained operational in Greece with a newly-established base.\n\n==Albania==\n{{Main|Albania during World War I}}\n\n[[File:Vlora zur Zeit der italienischen Besatzung 1916-1920.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Italian soldiers in [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Albania]] during [[World War I]].

Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]], which guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From 5 to 6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[\u0160ibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.<ref>Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria, recuperating from the [[Balkan Wars]], sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into [[Greek Macedonia]], and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The [[February Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution of February 1917]] had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\n\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the [[Macedonian front]] in the [[Vardar Offensive]]. While Bulgarian forces [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|stopped them]] in [[Dojran]] and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\n\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] abdicated in favour of his son [[Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\n\n==Macedonian front==\nIn 1915, the Austro-Hungarians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.\n\nThe [[Macedonian front]] stabilized roughly around the Greek border after the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force that had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]]. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards [[Salonika]], because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central Powers.\n\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], who led a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, [[Vardar Offensive|attacked out of Greece]]. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austro-Hungarian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\n\nBy October 1918, his army had [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|recaptured all of Serbia]] and was preparing to invade Hungary proper, but the offensive was halted by the Hungarian leadership offering to surrender in November 1918.\n\n==Results==\nThe French and British each kept six divisions on the Greek frontier from 1916 to the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence did not produce major effects and so they mobilized the useful forces to the Western Front. For nearly three years, those divisions accomplished essentially nothing and tied down only half of the Bulgarian army, which would not have gone far from Bulgaria anyway.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn mid 1918, led by General Franchet d'Esperey, those forces were added to conduct a major offensive on the south flank of the Quadruplice (8 French division, 6 British division, 1 Italian division, 12 Serbian division<ref>Bernard SCHNETZLER Les erreurs strat\u00e9giques pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre Mondiale, ECONOMICA, 2011 {{ISBN|2717852255}}</ref>). After the successul offensive launched on the 10th September 1918, they freed Belgrade and forced Bulgaria to Armistice on 29th September. That had a significative effect by threatening Austria-Hungary (which agreed to an rmistice on 4 November 1918) and then the German political leadership.\n\nIn fact, Keegan argued that \"the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the [[Megali Idea|\"Great Idea\"]] - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=World War I|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|isbn=0375700455|location=|pages=307}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=D.

A new attempt led to the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian [[Serbian campaign of World War I#1915|conquest of Serbia]] and [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegro]]. That led to the Serbian army to [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat through Albania]] and to be evacuated to [[Salonika]] by the Allies. There, they joined with the Franco-British [[Allied Army of the Orient]] and fought a protracted [[trench war]] against Bulgarian forces on the [[Macedonian front]]. The allied army was stationed in Greece, which resulted in the [[National Schism]] on whether Greece should join the Allies or remain neutral, which would benefit the Central Powers. Greece eventually joined the Allies in 1917. In September 1918, the [[Vardar Offensive]] broke through the lines of Bulgaria, which was [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|forced to surrender]], leading to the [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro]].\n\n==Overview==\nA major cause of the war was the hostility between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, which made some of the earliest fighting take place between them. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.\n\n[[Dalmatia]] was a strategic region during the war that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war upon agreeing to the [[Treaty of London, 1915]], which guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.\n\nIn 1917, Greece entered the war for the Allieds, and in 1918, the multinational [[Allied Army of the Orient]], based in northern [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], finally launched an offensive, which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and halted only at the border of [[Hungary]] in November 1918.\n\n==Serbian\u2013Montenegrin campaign==\n{{Main|Serbian campaign of World War I|Montenegrin Campaign of World War I}}\n\nThe Serbian army managed to to rebuff the larger [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] because Russia assisted by invading from the north. In 1915, Austro-Hungary placed additional soldiers in the south front and succeed in engaging Bulgaria as an ally.\n\nSoon, the Serbian army was attacked from the north and the east, forcing a [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat to Greece]]. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful, and the Serbian army remained operational in Greece with a newly-established base.\n\n==Albania==\n{{Main|Albania during World War I}}\n\n[[File:Vlora zur Zeit der italienischen Besatzung 1916-1920.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Italian soldiers in [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Albania]] during [[World War I]].

Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]], which guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From 5 to 6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[\u0160ibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.<ref>Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria, recuperating from the [[Balkan Wars]], sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into [[Greek Macedonia]], and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The [[February Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution of February 1917]] had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\n\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the [[Macedonian front]] in the [[Vardar Offensive]]. While Bulgarian forces [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|stopped them]] in [[Dojran]] and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\n\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] abdicated in favour of his son [[Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\n\n==Macedonian front==\nIn 1915, the Austro-Hungarians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.\n\nThe [[Macedonian front]] stabilized roughly around the Greek border after the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force that had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]]. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards [[Salonika]], because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central Powers.\n\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], who led a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, [[Vardar Offensive|attacked out of Greece]]. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austro-Hungarian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\n\nBy October 1918, his army had [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|recaptured all of Serbia]] and was preparing to invade Hungary proper, but the offensive was halted by the Hungarian leadership offering to surrender in November 1918.\n\n==Results==\nThe French and British each kept six divisions on the Greek frontier from 1916 to the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence did not produce major effects and so they mobilized the useful forces to the Western Front. For nearly three years, those divisions accomplished essentially nothing and tied down only half of the Bulgarian army, which would not have gone far from Bulgaria anyway.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn mid 1918, led by General Franchet d'Esperey, those forces were added to conduct a major offensive on the south flank of the Quadruplice (8 French division, 6 British division, 1 Italian division, 12 Serbian division<ref>Bernard SCHNETZLER Les erreurs strat\u00e9giques pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre Mondiale, ECONOMICA, 2011 {{ISBN|2717852255}}</ref>). After the successul offensive launched on the 10th September 1918, they freed Belgrade and forced Bulgaria to Armistice on 29th September. That had a significative effect by threatening Austria-Hungary (which agreed to an rmistice on 4 November 1918) and then the German political leadership.\n\nIn fact, Keegan argued that \"the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the [[Megali Idea|\"Great Idea\"]] - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=World War I|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|isbn=0375700455|location=|pages=307}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=D.

While the concept is similar to that of a [[mixed language|mixed or hybrid language]], creoles are often characterized by a tendency to systematize their inherited grammar (e.g., by eliminating irregularities or regularizing the conjugation of otherwise irregular verbs). Like any language, creoles are characterized by a consistent system of [[grammar]], possess large stable vocabularies, and are [[Language acquisition|acquired]] by children as their [[Nativization|native language]].<ref>Calvet, Louis-Jean.

''Defining creole''. Oxford University Press.</ref> \nCreolistics, or creology, is the study of creole languages and, as such, is a subfield of [[linguistics]]. Someone who engages in this study is called a creolist.\n\nThe precise number of creole languages is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500.  These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French<ref>{{cite web|title=Creole \u2013 Language Information & Resources|url=https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|website=www.alsintl.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620093817/https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|archive-date=June 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> due to the European [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] that arose at that time.<ref>''Linguistics'', ed.

In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is [[Haitian Creole]], with almost ten million native speakers,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valdman|first1=Albert|title=Creole: The national language of Haiti |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html|website=www.indiana.edu|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref> followed by [[Tok Pisin]] with about 4 million, most of whom are second-language speakers.\n\nThe [[lexicon]] (or, roughly, the base or essential vocabulary \u2013 such as \"say\" but not \"said, tell, told\") of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole's construction. However, there are often clear [[phoneme|phonetic]] and [[semantic]] shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.\n\n==Overview==\nA creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children \u2013 a process known as [[nativization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=61}}</ref> The [[pidgin]]-creole life cycle was studied by American linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Robert Hall]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1966}}</ref>\n\nSome linguists, such as Derek Bickerton, posit that creoles share more grammatical similarities with each other than with the languages from which they are phylogenetically derived.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983|pp=116\u2013122}}</ref> However, there is no widely accepted theory that would account for those perceived similarities.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Winford|1997|p=138}}; cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002}}</ref> Moreover, no grammatical feature has been shown to be specific to creoles.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1999}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}</ref><ref name=\"Gil 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}}</ref><ref name=\"Muysken 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lefebvre|2002}}</ref><ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\">{{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|2003}}</ref>\n\nMany of the creoles known today arose in the last 500 years, as a result of the worldwide expansion of European maritime power and trade in the [[Age of Discovery]], which led to extensive [[European colonialism|European colonial empires]]. Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or [[dialect]]s of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become [[Extinct language|extinct]]. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study.<ref name=DeCamp>{{Harvcoltxt|DeCamp|1977}}</ref><ref name=Sebba>{{Harvcoltxt|Sebba|1997}}</ref> Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.\n\nLinguists now recognize that creole formation is a universal phenomenon, not limited to the European colonial period, and an important aspect of language evolution (see {{Harvcoltxt|Vennemann|2003}}). For example, in 1933 [[Sigmund Feist]] postulated [[Germanic substrate hypothesis|a creole origin]] for the [[Germanic languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feist|first=Sigmund|date=1932|title=The Origin of the Germanic Languages and the Indo-Europeanising of North Europe|jstor=408831|journal=Language|volume=8|issue=4|pages=245\u2013254|doi=10.2307/408831}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged in trade colonies among \"users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions.\" Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |first=Salikoko |last=Mufwene |title=Pidgin and Creole Languages |website=Humanities.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044826/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |archive-date=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Etymology===\nThe English term ''creole'' comes from [[wiktionary:cr\u00e9ole|French]] {{Lang-fr|cr\u00e9ole|label=none}}, which is cognate with the [[wiktionary:criollo|Spanish term]] {{Lang-es|criollo|label=none}} and [[wiktionary:crioulo|Portuguese]] {{Lang-pt|crioulo|label=none}}, all descending from the verb ''criar'' ('to breed' or 'to raise'), all coming from Latin {{Lang-la|creare|label=none}} ('to produce, create').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|1988}}.</ref> The specific sense of the term was coined in the 16th and 17th century, during the great expansion in European maritime power and trade that led to the establishment of European colonies in other continents.\n\nThe terms ''criollo'' and ''crioulo'' were originally qualifiers used throughout the Spanish and Portuguese colonies to distinguish the members of an ethnic group who were born and raised locally from those who immigrated as adults. They were most commonly applied to nationals of the colonial power, e.g. to distinguish ''[[Criollo people|espa\u00f1oles criollos]]'' (people born in the colonies from Spanish ancestors) from {{Lang-es|espa\u00f1oles peninsulares|label=none}} (those born in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain). However, in Brazil the term was also used to distinguish between ''negros crioulos'' (blacks born in Brazil from African slave ancestors) and ''negros africanos'' (born in Africa). Over time, the term and its derivatives (Creole, Kr\u00e9ol, Kreyol, [[Krey\u00f2l]], Kriol, [[Krio language|Krio]], etc.) lost the generic meaning and became the proper name of many distinct ethnic groups that developed locally from immigrant communities. Originally, therefore, the term \"creole language\" meant the speech of any of those [[creole peoples]].\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nAs a consequence of colonial European trade patterns, most of the known European-based creole languages arose in coastal areas in the equatorial belt around the world, including the [[Americas]], western [[Africa]], [[Goa]] along the west of [[India]], and along Southeast [[Asia]] up to [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], Reunion, [[Seychelles]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Douglas B.|date=2008-12-01|title=Slave trade merchants of Spanish New Orleans, 1763\u20131803: Clarifying the colonial slave trade to Louisiana in Atlantic perspective|journal=Atlantic Studies|volume=5|issue=3|pages=335\u2013346|doi=10.1080/14788810802445024|issn=1478-8810}}</ref>\n\nMany of those creoles are now extinct, but others still survive in the [[Caribbean]], the north and east coasts of [[South America]] ([[The Guyanas]]), western [[Africa]], [[Australia]] (see [[Australian Kriol language]]), the [[Philippines]] (see [[Chavacano]]) and in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n[[Atlantic Creole]] languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]] languages. [[Indian Ocean]] Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like [[Nubi language|Nubi]] and [[Sango language|Sango]] that are derived solely from non-European languages.\n\n===Social and political status===black pepole speak this language some black pepole don't speak this languge i speak this a little\n\nBecause of the generally low status of the Creole peoples in the eyes of prior European colonial powers, creole languages have generally been regarded as \"degenerate\" languages, or at best as rudimentary \"dialects\" of the politically dominant parent languages. Because of this, the word \"creole\" was generally used by linguists in opposition to \"language\", rather than as a [[qualifier]] for it.<ref name=Meijer>See {{Harvcoltxt|Meijer|Muysken|1977}}.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century [[neogrammarian]] \"tree model\" for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the [[wave model (linguistics)|wave model]], [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt]], the forerunners of modern [[sociolinguistics]]). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the [[comparative method]] in [[historical linguistics]] and in [[creolistics]].<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Meijer /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\">{{Harvcoltxt|Traugott|1977}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timoun Sy\u00e8j (Creole).jpg|thumb|[[Haitian Creole]] in use at car rental counter, USA]]\nBecause of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref>Holm (1988, 1989) <!-- which one? --></ref> At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term \"creole\" or \"creole language\" for any language suspected to have undergone [[creolization]], terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices.\n\nCreolization is widely thought to be a leading influence on the evolution of [[African-American English]] (AAE).  The controversy surrounding African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the American education system, as well as the past use of the word [[Ebonics (word)|''ebonics'']] to refer to it, mirrors the historical negative connotation of the word ''creole''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert L.|date=2016-07-25|title=The Ebonics Controversy|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1177/00957984970233002}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n===Historic classification===\nAccording to their external history, four types of creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] creoles, and creolized pidgins.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=15}}</ref> By the very nature of a creole language, the [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] classification of a particular creole usually is a matter of dispute; especially when the [[pidgin]] precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.\n\nPhylogenetic classification traditionally relies on inheritance of the lexicon, especially of \"core\" terms, and of the grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is ''the'' parent of a creole \u2013 that is, whether a language should be classified as a \"French creole\", \"Portuguese creole\" or \"English creole\", etc. \u2013 often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\" />\n\n===Substrate and superstrate===\nThe terms [[substratum|substrate]] and [[superstratum|superstrate]] are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in [[second language acquisition]] or [[language shift|language replacement]] events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).<ref name=Weinreich>{{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}</ref> The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive as a second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.<ref name=Weinreich />\n\nHowever, there is dispute over the extent to which the terms \"substrate\" and \"superstrate\" are applicable to the genesis or the description of creole languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}</ref> The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1996}}</ref> The substratum-superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in [[Papiamentu]]), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies.<ref name=\"Muysken 2001\"/> On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way.<ref>Recent investigations about substrates and superstrates, in creoles and other languages, includes {{Harvcoltxt|Feist|1932}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Jungemann|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Martinet|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1983}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}.</ref> In the literature on [[Atlantic Creole]]s, \"superstrate\" usually means European and \"substrate\" non-European or African.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}</ref>\n\n===Decreolization===\nSince creole languages rarely attain official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This [[decreolization]] process typically brings about a [[post-creole speech continuum]] characterized by large-scale variation and [[hypercorrection]] in the language.<ref name=DeCamp />\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that creoles have a simpler grammar and more internal variability than older, more established languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html|title=Creole and pidgin language structure in cross-linguistic perspective|date=August 2013|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \u2013 Department of Linguistics}}</ref> However, these notions are occasionally challenged.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=9}}</ref> (See also [[language complexity]].)\n\nPhylogenetic or [[linguistic typology|typological]] comparisons of creole languages have led to divergent conclusions. Similarities are usually higher among creoles derived from related languages, such as the [[languages of Europe]], than among broader groups that include also creoles based on non-[[Indo-European languages]] (like Nubi or Sango). [[French-based creole languages|French-based creoles]] in turn are more similar to each other (and to varieties of French) than to other European-based creoles. It was observed, in particular, that [[definite article]]s are mostly prenominal in [[English-based creole languages]] and English whereas they are generally postnominal in [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] and in the [[Quebec French|variety of French]] that was [[History of Quebec French|exported to what is now Quebec in the 17th and 18th century]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}}.</ref> Moreover, the European languages which gave rise to the creole languages of European colonies all belong to the same subgroup of Western [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and have highly convergent grammars; to the point that [[Sapir Whorf|Whorf]] joined them into a single [[Standard Average European]] language group.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956}}</ref> French and English are particularly close, since English, through extensive borrowing, is typologically closer to French than to other Germanic languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|Maroldt|1977}}</ref> Thus the claimed similarities between creoles may be mere consequences of similar parentage, rather than characteristic features of all creoles.\n\n==Creole genesis==\nThere are a variety of theories on the origin of creole languages, all of which attempt to explain the similarities among them. {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} outline a fourfold classification of explanations regarding creole genesis:\n* Theories focusing on European input\n* Theories focusing on non-European input\n* Gradualist and developmental hypotheses\n* Universalist approaches\n\nIn addition to the precise mechanism of creole genesis, a more general debate has developed whether creole languages are characterized by different mechanisms in opposition to traditional languages (which is McWhorter's 2018 main point)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Creole Debate|last=McWhorter|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=3}}</ref> or whether in that regard creole languages develop by the same mechanisms as any other languages (e.g. DeGraff 2001).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeGraff|first=Michael|date=2001|title=On the origin of creoles|url=|journal=Linguistic Typology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\n===Theories focusing on European input===\n====Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles====\nThe [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] of pidgins and creoles hypothesizes that they are all derived from a single [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], via a West African Pidgin Portuguese of the seventeenth century, [[relexification|relexified]] in the so-called \"slave factories\" of Western Africa that were the source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. This theory was originally formulated by [[Hugo Schuchardt]] in the late nineteenth century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor,<ref>such as in {{Harvcoltxt|Taylor|1977}}</ref> Whinnom,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1956}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1965}}</ref> Thompson,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1961}}</ref> and Stewart.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Stewart|1962}}</ref>  However, this hypothesis is no longer actively investigated, as there are examples of creoles, such as [[Hezhou language|Hezhou]], which evidently have nothing to do with the Lingua Franca.\n\n====Domestic origin hypothesis====\nProposed by {{Harvcoltxt|Hancock |1985}} for the origin of English-based creoles of the West Indies, the Domestic Origin Hypothesis argues that, towards the end of the 16th century, English-speaking traders began to settle in the Gambia and [[Sierra Leone]] rivers as well as in neighboring areas such as the Bullom and Sherbro coasts. These settlers intermarried with the local population leading to mixed populations, and, as a result of this intermarriage, an English pidgin was created. This pidgin was learned by slaves in slave depots, who later on took it to the West Indies and formed one component of the emerging English creoles.\n\n====European dialect origin hypothesis====\nThe [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] are the foremost candidates to being the outcome of \"normal\" [[language change|linguistic change]] and their [[creoleness]] to be sociohistoric in nature and relative to their colonial origin.<ref>There are some similarities in this line of thinking with [[Ian F. Hancock|Hancock's]] domestic origin hypothesis.</ref> Within this theoretical framework, a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] is a language [[phylogenetic]]ally based on [[French language|French]], more specifically on a 17th-century [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French extant in [[Paris]], the French Atlantic harbours, and the nascent French colonies. Supporters of this hypothesis suggest that the non-Creole French dialects still spoken in many parts of the Americas share mutual descent from this single koin\u00e9. These dialects are found in [[Canada]] (mostly in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and in [[Acadian]] communities), [[Louisiana]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]] and as [[Language isolate|isolates]] in other parts of the Americas.<ref>Wittmann (1983, 1995, 2001), {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|Wittmann|1995}}; cf. the article on Quebec French and the History of Quebec French</ref> Approaches under this hypothesis are compatible with [[gradualism]] in [[Language change|change]] and models of [[Creole language#Imperfect L2 learning|imperfect language transmission]] in [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] genesis.\n\n====Foreigner talk and baby talk====\nThe Foreigner Talk (FT) hypothesis argues that a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language in order to address speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called [[baby talk]].<ref>See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Ferguson|1971}}</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} suggest that four different processes are involved in creating Foreigner Talk:\n* Accommodation\n* Imitation\n* Telegraphic condensation\n* Conventions\n\nThis could explain why creole languages have much in common, while avoiding a monogenetic model. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Hinnenkamp|1984}}, in analyzing German Foreigner Talk, claims that it is too inconsistent and unpredictable to provide any model for language learning.\n\nWhile the simplification of input was supposed to account for creoles' simple grammar, commentators have raised a number of criticisms of this explanation:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=73}}</ref>\n# There are a great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins and creoles despite having very different [[lexifier]] languages.<!-- That is actually a fiercely debated point, see elsewhere in the article -->\n# Grammatical simplification can be explained by other processes, i.e. the innate grammar of [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]].<!-- This theory is highly controversial and presupposes the acceptance of some form of psychological nativism \u2013 which most non-Chomskyan linguists reject -->\n# Speakers of a creole's lexifier language often fail to understand, without learning the language, the grammar of a pidgin or creole.\n# Pidgins are more often used amongst speakers of different substrate languages than between such speakers and those of the lexifier language.\n\nAnother problem with the FT explanation is its potential circularity. {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} points out that FT is often based on the imitation of the incorrect speech of the non-natives, that is the pidgin.<!-- Non-native speech is not necessarily pidgin at all! --> Therefore, one may be mistaken in assuming that the former gave rise to the latter.\n\n====Imperfect L2 learning====\nThe imperfect L2 ([[second language]]) learning hypothesis claims that pidgins are primarily the result of the imperfect L2 learning of the dominant lexifier language by the slaves. Research on naturalistic L2 processes has revealed a number of features of \"interlanguage systems\" that are also seen in pidgins and creoles:\n* invariant verb forms derived from the infinitive or the least marked finite verb form;\n* loss of determiners or use as determiners of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs;\n* placement of a negative particle in preverbal position;\n* use of adverbs to express modality;\n* fixed single word order with no inversion in questions;\n* reduced or absent nominal plural marking.\n\nImperfect L2 learning is compatible with other approaches, notably the European dialect origin hypothesis and the universalist models of language transmission.<ref>Based on 19th-century intuitions, approaches underlying the imperfect L2 learning hypothesis have been followed up in the works of {{Harvcoltxt|Schumann|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Anderson|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Seuren|Wekker|1986}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Geeslin|2002}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hamilton|Coslett|2008}}.</ref>\n\n===Theories focusing on non-European input===\nTheories focusing on the substrate, or non-European, languages attribute similarities amongst creoles to the similarities of African substrate languages. These features are often assumed to be transferred from the substrate language to the creole or to be preserved invariant from the substrate language in the creole through a process of [[relexification]]: the substrate language replaces the native [[lexical items]] with lexical material from the superstrate language while retaining the native grammatical categories.<ref>See the article on [[relexification]] for a discussion of the controversy surrounding the retaining of substrate grammatical features through relexification.</ref> The problem with this explanation is that the postulated substrate languages differ amongst themselves and with creoles in meaningful ways. {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}} argues that the number and diversity of African languages and the paucity of a historical record on creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences a matter of chance. {{Harvcoltxt|Dillard|1970}} coined the term \"cafeteria principle\" to refer to the practice of arbitrarily attributing features of creoles to the influence of substrate African languages or assorted substandard dialects of European languages.\n\nFor a representative debate on this issue, see the contributions to {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}; for a more recent view, {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall |2000}}.\n\nBecause of the sociohistoric similarities amongst many (but by no means all) of the creoles, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the plantation system of the European colonies have been emphasized as factors by linguists such as {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1999}}.\n\n===Gradualist and developmental hypotheses===\nOne class of creoles might start as [[pidgin]]s, rudimentary second languages improvised for use between speakers of two or more non-intelligible native languages. Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others. The lexicon of a pidgin is usually small and drawn from the vocabularies of its speakers, in varying proportions. Morphological details like word [[inflection]]s, which usually take years to learn, are omitted; the syntax is kept very simple, usually based on strict word order. In this initial stage, all aspects of the speech \u2013 syntax, lexicon, and pronunciation \u2013 tend to be quite variable, especially with regard to the speaker's background.\n\nIf a pidgin manages to be learned by the children of a community as a native language, it may become fixed and acquire a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. Pidgins can become full languages in only a single [[generation]]. \"Creolization\" is this second stage where the pidgin language develops into a fully developed native language. The vocabulary, too, will develop to contain more and more items according to a rationale of lexical enrichment.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Universalist approaches===\n{{Further|Universal grammar}}\n[[linguistic universal| Universalist]] models stress the intervention of specific general processes during the transmission of language from generation to generation and from speaker to speaker. The process invoked varies: a general tendency towards [[semantic]] [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], first-[[language learning]] driven by universal process, or a general process of [[discourse]] [[organization]]. [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]], proposed in the 1980s, remains the main universalist theory.<ref>\nSee {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1984}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1988}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1991}}\n</ref>\nBickerton claims that creoles are inventions of the children growing up on newly-founded [[plantations]]. Around them, they only heard pidgins spoken, without enough structure to function as [[natural language]]s; and the children used their own [[innate]] linguistic capacities to transform the pidgin input into a full-fledged language. The alleged common features of all creoles would then stem from those innate abilities being universal.\n\n==Recent studies==\nThe last decades have seen the emergence of some new questions about the nature of creoles: in particular, the question of how complex creoles are and the question of whether creoles are indeed \"exceptional\" languages.\n\n===Creole prototype===\nSome features that distinguish creole languages from noncreoles have been proposed (by Bickerton,<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}</ref> for example).\n\n[[John McWhorter]]<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> has proposed the following list of features to indicate a '''creole prototype''':\n* a lack of inflectional morphology (other than at most two or three inflectional affixes),\n* a lack of tone on monosyllabic words, and\n* a lack of semantically opaque word formation.\n\nMcWhorter hypothesizes that these three properties exactly characterize a creole. However, the creole prototype hypothesis has been disputed:\n* [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and David {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} argue that languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Magoua|Magoua French]] and [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] have all these three features but show none of the sociohistoric traits of creole languages.\n* Others (see overview in {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}) have demonstrated creoles that serve as counterexamples to McWhorter's hypothesis \u2013 the existence of [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], for example, or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law |2001}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptionalism===\nBuilding up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\", claiming that every noncreole language's grammar is at least as complex as any creole language's grammar.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> Gil has replied that [[Riau Indonesian]] has a simpler grammar than [[Saramaccan]], the language McWhorter uses as a showcase for his theory.<ref name=\"Gil 2001\"/> The same objections were raised by Wittmann in his 1999 debate with McWhorter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html|title=Prototype as a Typological Yardstick to Creoleness|website=www.nou-la.org}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of progress made in defining creoles in terms of their morphology and syntax has led scholars such as [[Robert Chaudenson]], [[Salikoko Mufwene]], [[Michel DeGraff]], and [[Henri Wittmann]] to question the value of ''creole'' as a typological class; they argue that creoles are structurally no different from any other language, and that ''creole'' is a sociohistoric concept \u2013 not a linguistic one \u2013 encompassing displaced populations and slavery.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}, Wittmann (2001)</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} spell out the idea of creole exceptionalism, claiming that creole languages are an instance of nongenetic language change due to language shift with abnormal transmission. Gradualists question the abnormal transmission of languages in a creole setting and argue that the processes which created today's creole languages are no different from universal patterns of language change.\n\nGiven these objections to ''creole'' as a concept, DeGraff and others question the idea that creoles are exceptional in any meaningful way.<ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\" /><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|2007}}</ref> Additionally, {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2002}} argues that some [[Romance language]]s are potential creoles but that they are not considered as such by linguists because of a historical bias against such a view.\n\n==Controversy==\nCreolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls \"the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness.\"  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.\n\n===\"Creole\", a sociohistoric concept===\n''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref> and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}</ref> In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as \"the most creole of creoles.\"{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.\n\n===\"Creole\", a genuine linguistic concept===\nOn the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.</ref> Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.\n\nTo the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on \"defining creole\", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]</ref> As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.\n\n===Proposed synthesis===\nThe answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}\n\nThe answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.\n\nThough the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Giv\u00f3n|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:\n\n:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''\n:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''\n:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''\n:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''\n\nThe authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into

Someone who engages in this study is called a creolist.\n\nThe precise number of creole languages is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500.  These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French<ref>{{cite web|title=Creole \u2013 Language Information & Resources|url=https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|website=www.alsintl.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620093817/https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|archive-date=June 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> due to the European [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] that arose at that time.<ref>''Linguistics'', ed.

In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is [[Haitian Creole]], with almost ten million native speakers,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valdman|first1=Albert|title=Creole: The national language of Haiti |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html|website=www.indiana.edu|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref> followed by [[Tok Pisin]] with about 4 million, most of whom are second-language speakers.\n\nThe [[lexicon]] (or, roughly, the base or essential vocabulary \u2013 such as \"say\" but not \"said, tell, told\") of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole's construction. However, there are often clear [[phoneme|phonetic]] and [[semantic]] shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.\n\n==Overview==\nA creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children \u2013 a process known as [[nativization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=61}}</ref> The [[pidgin]]-creole life cycle was studied by American linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Robert Hall]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1966}}</ref>\n\nSome linguists, such as Derek Bickerton, posit that creoles share more grammatical similarities with each other than with the languages from which they are phylogenetically derived.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983|pp=116\u2013122}}</ref> However, there is no widely accepted theory that would account for those perceived similarities.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Winford|1997|p=138}}; cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002}}</ref> Moreover, no grammatical feature has been shown to be specific to creoles.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1999}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}</ref><ref name=\"Gil 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}}</ref><ref name=\"Muysken 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lefebvre|2002}}</ref><ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\">{{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|2003}}</ref>\n\nMany of the creoles known today arose in the last 500 years, as a result of the worldwide expansion of European maritime power and trade in the [[Age of Discovery]], which led to extensive [[European colonialism|European colonial empires]]. Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or [[dialect]]s of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become [[Extinct language|extinct]]. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study.<ref name=DeCamp>{{Harvcoltxt|DeCamp|1977}}</ref><ref name=Sebba>{{Harvcoltxt|Sebba|1997}}</ref> Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.\n\nLinguists now recognize that creole formation is a universal phenomenon, not limited to the European colonial period, and an important aspect of language evolution (see {{Harvcoltxt|Vennemann|2003}}). For example, in 1933 [[Sigmund Feist]] postulated [[Germanic substrate hypothesis|a creole origin]] for the [[Germanic languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feist|first=Sigmund|date=1932|title=The Origin of the Germanic Languages and the Indo-Europeanising of North Europe|jstor=408831|journal=Language|volume=8|issue=4|pages=245\u2013254|doi=10.2307/408831}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged in trade colonies among \"users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions.\" Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |first=Salikoko |last=Mufwene |title=Pidgin and Creole Languages |website=Humanities.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044826/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |archive-date=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Etymology===\nThe English term ''creole'' comes from [[wiktionary:cr\u00e9ole|French]] {{Lang-fr|cr\u00e9ole|label=none}}, which is cognate with the [[wiktionary:criollo|Spanish term]] {{Lang-es|criollo|label=none}} and [[wiktionary:crioulo|Portuguese]] {{Lang-pt|crioulo|label=none}}, all descending from the verb ''criar'' ('to breed' or 'to raise'), all coming from Latin {{Lang-la|creare|label=none}} ('to produce, create').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|1988}}.</ref> The specific sense of the term was coined in the 16th and 17th century, during the great expansion in European maritime power and trade that led to the establishment of European colonies in other continents.\n\nThe terms ''criollo'' and ''crioulo'' were originally qualifiers used throughout the Spanish and Portuguese colonies to distinguish the members of an ethnic group who were born and raised locally from those who immigrated as adults. They were most commonly applied to nationals of the colonial power, e.g. to distinguish ''[[Criollo people|espa\u00f1oles criollos]]'' (people born in the colonies from Spanish ancestors) from {{Lang-es|espa\u00f1oles peninsulares|label=none}} (those born in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain). However, in Brazil the term was also used to distinguish between ''negros crioulos'' (blacks born in Brazil from African slave ancestors) and ''negros africanos'' (born in Africa). Over time, the term and its derivatives (Creole, Kr\u00e9ol, Kreyol, [[Krey\u00f2l]], Kriol, [[Krio language|Krio]], etc.) lost the generic meaning and became the proper name of many distinct ethnic groups that developed locally from immigrant communities. Originally, therefore, the term \"creole language\" meant the speech of any of those [[creole peoples]].\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nAs a consequence of colonial European trade patterns, most of the known European-based creole languages arose in coastal areas in the equatorial belt around the world, including the [[Americas]], western [[Africa]], [[Goa]] along the west of [[India]], and along Southeast [[Asia]] up to [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], Reunion, [[Seychelles]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Douglas B.|date=2008-12-01|title=Slave trade merchants of Spanish New Orleans, 1763\u20131803: Clarifying the colonial slave trade to Louisiana in Atlantic perspective|journal=Atlantic Studies|volume=5|issue=3|pages=335\u2013346|doi=10.1080/14788810802445024|issn=1478-8810}}</ref>\n\nMany of those creoles are now extinct, but others still survive in the [[Caribbean]], the north and east coasts of [[South America]] ([[The Guyanas]]), western [[Africa]], [[Australia]] (see [[Australian Kriol language]]), the [[Philippines]] (see [[Chavacano]]) and in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n[[Atlantic Creole]] languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]] languages. [[Indian Ocean]] Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like [[Nubi language|Nubi]] and [[Sango language|Sango]] that are derived solely from non-European languages.\n\n===Social and political status===\nBecause of the generally low status of the Creole peoples in the eyes of prior European colonial powers, creole languages have generally been regarded as \"degenerate\" languages, or at best as rudimentary \"dialects\" of the politically dominant parent languages. Because of this, the word \"creole\" was generally used by linguists in opposition to \"language\", rather than as a [[qualifier]] for it.<ref name=Meijer>See {{Harvcoltxt|Meijer|Muysken|1977}}.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century [[neogrammarian]] \"tree model\" for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the [[wave model (linguistics)|wave model]], [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt]], the forerunners of modern [[sociolinguistics]]). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the [[comparative method]] in [[historical linguistics]] and in [[creolistics]].<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Meijer /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\">{{Harvcoltxt|Traugott|1977}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timoun Sy\u00e8j (Creole).jpg|thumb|[[Haitian Creole]] in use at car rental counter, USA]]\nBecause of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref>Holm (1988, 1989) <!-- which one? --></ref> At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term \"creole\" or \"creole language\" for any language suspected to have undergone [[creolization]], terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices.\n\nCreolization is widely thought to be a leading influence on the evolution of [[African-American English]] (AAE).  The controversy surrounding African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the American education system, as well as the past use of the word [[Ebonics (word)|''ebonics'']] to refer to it, mirrors the historical negative connotation of the word ''creole''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert L.|date=2016-07-25|title=The Ebonics Controversy|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1177/00957984970233002}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n===Historic classification===\nAccording to their external history, four types of creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] creoles, and creolized pidgins.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=15}}</ref> By the very nature of a creole language, the [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] classification of a particular creole usually is a matter of dispute; especially when the [[pidgin]] precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.\n\nPhylogenetic classification traditionally relies on inheritance of the lexicon, especially of \"core\" terms, and of the grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is ''the'' parent of a creole \u2013 that is, whether a language should be classified as a \"French creole\", \"Portuguese creole\" or \"English creole\", etc. \u2013 often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\" />\n\n===Substrate and superstrate===\nThe terms [[substratum|substrate]] and [[superstratum|superstrate]] are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in [[second language acquisition]] or [[language shift|language replacement]] events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).<ref name=Weinreich>{{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}</ref> The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive as a second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.<ref name=Weinreich />\n\nHowever, there is dispute over the extent to which the terms \"substrate\" and \"superstrate\" are applicable to the genesis or the description of creole languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}</ref> The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1996}}</ref> The substratum-superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in [[Papiamentu]]), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies.<ref name=\"Muysken 2001\"/> On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way.<ref>Recent investigations about substrates and superstrates, in creoles and other languages, includes {{Harvcoltxt|Feist|1932}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Jungemann|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Martinet|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1983}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}.</ref> In the literature on [[Atlantic Creole]]s, \"superstrate\" usually means European and \"substrate\" non-European or African.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}</ref>\n\n===Decreolization===\nSince creole languages rarely attain official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This [[decreolization]] process typically brings about a [[post-creole speech continuum]] characterized by large-scale variation and [[hypercorrection]] in the language.<ref name=DeCamp />\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that creoles have a simpler grammar and more internal variability than older, more established languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html|title=Creole and pidgin language structure in cross-linguistic perspective|date=August 2013|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \u2013 Department of Linguistics}}</ref> However, these notions are occasionally challenged.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=9}}</ref> (See also [[language complexity]].)\n\nPhylogenetic or [[linguistic typology|typological]] comparisons of creole languages have led to divergent conclusions. Similarities are usually higher among creoles derived from related languages, such as the [[languages of Europe]], than among broader groups that include also creoles based on non-[[Indo-European languages]] (like Nubi or Sango). [[French-based creole languages|French-based creoles]] in turn are more similar to each other (and to varieties of French) than to other European-based creoles. It was observed, in particular, that [[definite article]]s are mostly prenominal in [[English-based creole languages]] and English whereas they are generally postnominal in [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] and in the [[Quebec French|variety of French]] that was [[History of Quebec French|exported to what is now Quebec in the 17th and 18th century]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}}.</ref> Moreover, the European languages which gave rise to the creole languages of European colonies all belong to the same subgroup of Western [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and have highly convergent grammars; to the point that [[Sapir Whorf|Whorf]] joined them into a single [[Standard Average European]] language group.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956}}</ref> French and English are particularly close, since English, through extensive borrowing, is typologically closer to French than to other Germanic languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|Maroldt|1977}}</ref> Thus the claimed similarities between creoles may be mere consequences of similar parentage, rather than characteristic features of all creoles.\n\n==Creole genesis==\nThere are a variety of theories on the origin of creole languages, all of which attempt to explain the similarities among them. {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} outline a fourfold classification of explanations regarding creole genesis:\n* Theories focusing on European input\n* Theories focusing on non-European input\n* Gradualist and developmental hypotheses\n* Universalist approaches\n\nIn addition to the precise mechanism of creole genesis, a more general debate has developed whether creole languages are characterized by different mechanisms in opposition to traditional languages (which is McWhorter's 2018 main point)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Creole Debate|last=McWhorter|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=3}}</ref> or whether in that regard creole languages develop by the same mechanisms as any other languages (e.g. DeGraff 2001).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeGraff|first=Michael|date=2001|title=On the origin of creoles|url=|journal=Linguistic Typology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\n===Theories focusing on European input===\n====Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles====\nThe [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] of pidgins and creoles hypothesizes that they are all derived from a single [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], via a West African Pidgin Portuguese of the seventeenth century, [[relexification|relexified]] in the so-called \"slave factories\" of Western Africa that were the source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. This theory was originally formulated by [[Hugo Schuchardt]] in the late nineteenth century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor,<ref>such as in {{Harvcoltxt|Taylor|1977}}</ref> Whinnom,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1956}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1965}}</ref> Thompson,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1961}}</ref> and Stewart.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Stewart|1962}}</ref>  However, this hypothesis is no longer actively investigated, as there are examples of creoles, such as [[Hezhou language|Hezhou]], which evidently have nothing to do with the Lingua Franca.\n\n====Domestic origin hypothesis====\nProposed by {{Harvcoltxt|Hancock |1985}} for the origin of English-based creoles of the West Indies, the Domestic Origin Hypothesis argues that, towards the end of the 16th century, English-speaking traders began to settle in the Gambia and [[Sierra Leone]] rivers as well as in neighboring areas such as the Bullom and Sherbro coasts. These settlers intermarried with the local population leading to mixed populations, and, as a result of this intermarriage, an English pidgin was created. This pidgin was learned by slaves in slave depots, who later on took it to the West Indies and formed one component of the emerging English creoles.\n\n====European dialect origin hypothesis====\nThe [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] are the foremost candidates to being the outcome of \"normal\" [[language change|linguistic change]] and their [[creoleness]] to be sociohistoric in nature and relative to their colonial origin.<ref>There are some similarities in this line of thinking with [[Ian F. Hancock|Hancock's]] domestic origin hypothesis.</ref> Within this theoretical framework, a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] is a language [[phylogenetic]]ally based on [[French language|French]], more specifically on a 17th-century [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French extant in [[Paris]], the French Atlantic harbours, and the nascent French colonies. Supporters of this hypothesis suggest that the non-Creole French dialects still spoken in many parts of the Americas share mutual descent from this single koin\u00e9. These dialects are found in [[Canada]] (mostly in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and in [[Acadian]] communities), [[Louisiana]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]] and as [[Language isolate|isolates]] in other parts of the Americas.<ref>Wittmann (1983, 1995, 2001), {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|Wittmann|1995}}; cf. the article on Quebec French and the History of Quebec French</ref> Approaches under this hypothesis are compatible with [[gradualism]] in [[Language change|change]] and models of [[Creole language#Imperfect L2 learning|imperfect language transmission]] in [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] genesis.\n\n====Foreigner talk and baby talk====\nThe Foreigner Talk (FT) hypothesis argues that a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language in order to address speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called [[baby talk]].<ref>See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Ferguson|1971}}</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} suggest that four different processes are involved in creating Foreigner Talk:\n* Accommodation\n* Imitation\n* Telegraphic condensation\n* Conventions\n\nThis could explain why creole languages have much in common, while avoiding a monogenetic model. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Hinnenkamp|1984}}, in analyzing German Foreigner Talk, claims that it is too inconsistent and unpredictable to provide any model for language learning.\n\nWhile the simplification of input was supposed to account for creoles' simple grammar, commentators have raised a number of criticisms of this explanation:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=73}}</ref>\n# There are a great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins and creoles despite having very different [[lexifier]] languages.<!-- That is actually a fiercely debated point, see elsewhere in the article -->\n# Grammatical simplification can be explained by other processes, i.e. the innate grammar of [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]].<!-- This theory is highly controversial and presupposes the acceptance of some form of psychological nativism \u2013 which most non-Chomskyan linguists reject -->\n# Speakers of a creole's lexifier language often fail to understand, without learning the language, the grammar of a pidgin or creole.\n# Pidgins are more often used amongst speakers of different substrate languages than between such speakers and those of the lexifier language.\n\nAnother problem with the FT explanation is its potential circularity. {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} points out that FT is often based on the imitation of the incorrect speech of the non-natives, that is the pidgin.<!-- Non-native speech is not necessarily pidgin at all! --> Therefore, one may be mistaken in assuming that the former gave rise to the latter.\n\n====Imperfect L2 learning====\nThe imperfect L2 ([[second language]]) learning hypothesis claims that pidgins are primarily the result of the imperfect L2 learning of the dominant lexifier language by the slaves. Research on naturalistic L2 processes has revealed a number of features of \"interlanguage systems\" that are also seen in pidgins and creoles:\n* invariant verb forms derived from the infinitive or the least marked finite verb form;\n* loss of determiners or use as determiners of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs;\n* placement of a negative particle in preverbal position;\n* use of adverbs to express modality;\n* fixed single word order with no inversion in questions;\n* reduced or absent nominal plural marking.\n\nImperfect L2 learning is compatible with other approaches, notably the European dialect origin hypothesis and the universalist models of language transmission.<ref>Based on 19th-century intuitions, approaches underlying the imperfect L2 learning hypothesis have been followed up in the works of {{Harvcoltxt|Schumann|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Anderson|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Seuren|Wekker|1986}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Geeslin|2002}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hamilton|Coslett|2008}}.</ref>\n\n===Theories focusing on non-European input===\nTheories focusing on the substrate, or non-European, languages attribute similarities amongst creoles to the similarities of African substrate languages. These features are often assumed to be transferred from the substrate language to the creole or to be preserved invariant from the substrate language in the creole through a process of [[relexification]]: the substrate language replaces the native [[lexical items]] with lexical material from the superstrate language while retaining the native grammatical categories.<ref>See the article on [[relexification]] for a discussion of the controversy surrounding the retaining of substrate grammatical features through relexification.</ref> The problem with this explanation is that the postulated substrate languages differ amongst themselves and with creoles in meaningful ways. {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}} argues that the number and diversity of African languages and the paucity of a historical record on creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences a matter of chance. {{Harvcoltxt|Dillard|1970}} coined the term \"cafeteria principle\" to refer to the practice of arbitrarily attributing features of creoles to the influence of substrate African languages or assorted substandard dialects of European languages.\n\nFor a representative debate on this issue, see the contributions to {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}; for a more recent view, {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall |2000}}.\n\nBecause of the sociohistoric similarities amongst many (but by no means all) of the creoles, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the plantation system of the European colonies have been emphasized as factors by linguists such as {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1999}}.\n\n===Gradualist and developmental hypotheses===\nOne class of creoles might start as [[pidgin]]s, rudimentary second languages improvised for use between speakers of two or more non-intelligible native languages. Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others. The lexicon of a pidgin is usually small and drawn from the vocabularies of its speakers, in varying proportions. Morphological details like word [[inflection]]s, which usually take years to learn, are omitted; the syntax is kept very simple, usually based on strict word order. In this initial stage, all aspects of the speech \u2013 syntax, lexicon, and pronunciation \u2013 tend to be quite variable, especially with regard to the speaker's background.\n\nIf a pidgin manages to be learned by the children of a community as a native language, it may become fixed and acquire a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. Pidgins can become full languages in only a single [[generation]]. \"Creolization\" is this second stage where the pidgin language develops into a fully developed native language. The vocabulary, too, will develop to contain more and more items according to a rationale of lexical enrichment.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Universalist approaches===\n{{Further|Universal grammar}}\n[[linguistic universal| Universalist]] models stress the intervention of specific general processes during the transmission of language from generation to generation and from speaker to speaker. The process invoked varies: a general tendency towards [[semantic]] [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], first-[[language learning]] driven by universal process, or a general process of [[discourse]] [[organization]]. [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]], proposed in the 1980s, remains the main universalist theory.<ref>\nSee {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1984}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1988}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1991}}\n</ref>\nBickerton claims that creoles are inventions of the children growing up on newly-founded [[plantations]]. Around them, they only heard pidgins spoken, without enough structure to function as [[natural language]]s; and the children used their own [[innate]] linguistic capacities to transform the pidgin input into a full-fledged language. The alleged common features of all creoles would then stem from those innate abilities being universal.\n\n==Recent studies==\nThe last decades have seen the emergence of some new questions about the nature of creoles: in particular, the question of how complex creoles are and the question of whether creoles are indeed \"exceptional\" languages.\n\n===Creole prototype===\nSome features that distinguish creole languages from noncreoles have been proposed (by Bickerton,<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}</ref> for example).\n\n[[John McWhorter]]<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> has proposed the following list of features to indicate a '''creole prototype''':\n* a lack of inflectional morphology (other than at most two or three inflectional affixes),\n* a lack of tone on monosyllabic words, and\n* a lack of semantically opaque word formation.\n\nMcWhorter hypothesizes that these three properties exactly characterize a creole. However, the creole prototype hypothesis has been disputed:\n* [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and David {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} argue that languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Magoua|Magoua French]] and [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] have all these three features but show none of the sociohistoric traits of creole languages.\n* Others (see overview in {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}) have demonstrated creoles that serve as counterexamples to McWhorter's hypothesis \u2013 the existence of [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], for example, or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law |2001}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptionalism===\nBuilding up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\", claiming that every noncreole language's grammar is at least as complex as any creole language's grammar.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> Gil has replied that [[Riau Indonesian]] has a simpler grammar than [[Saramaccan]], the language McWhorter uses as a showcase for his theory.<ref name=\"Gil 2001\"/> The same objections were raised by Wittmann in his 1999 debate with McWhorter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html|title=Prototype as a Typological Yardstick to Creoleness|website=www.nou-la.org}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of progress made in defining creoles in terms of their morphology and syntax has led scholars such as [[Robert Chaudenson]], [[Salikoko Mufwene]], [[Michel DeGraff]], and [[Henri Wittmann]] to question the value of ''creole'' as a typological class; they argue that creoles are structurally no different from any other language, and that ''creole'' is a sociohistoric concept \u2013 not a linguistic one \u2013 encompassing displaced populations and slavery.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}, Wittmann (2001)</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} spell out the idea of creole exceptionalism, claiming that creole languages are an instance of nongenetic language change due to language shift with abnormal transmission. Gradualists question the abnormal transmission of languages in a creole setting and argue that the processes which created today's creole languages are no different from universal patterns of language change.\n\nGiven these objections to ''creole'' as a concept, DeGraff and others question the idea that creoles are exceptional in any meaningful way.<ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\" /><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|2007}}</ref> Additionally, {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2002}} argues that some [[Romance language]]s are potential creoles but that they are not considered as such by linguists because of a historical bias against such a view.\n\n==Controversy==\nCreolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls \"the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness.\"  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.\n\n===\"Creole\", a sociohistoric concept===\n''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref> and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}</ref> In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as \"the most creole of creoles.\"{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.\n\n===\"Creole\", a genuine linguistic concept===\nOn the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.</ref> Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.\n\nTo the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on \"defining creole\", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]</ref> As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.\n\n===Proposed synthesis===\nThe answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}\n\nThe answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.\n\nThough the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Giv\u00f3n|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:\n\n:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''\n:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''\n:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''\n:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''\n\nThe authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into
