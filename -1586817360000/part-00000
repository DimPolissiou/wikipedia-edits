It was released in May 1994 as the lead single from the original movie soundtrack ''[[Reality Bites]]'' (1994). The song was written and composed by Loeb herself, while production was handled by Juan Pati\u00f1o and Loeb, who previously produced some of her songs back with Nine Stories. \"Stay\" was originally conceived in 1990 when she formed the band Nine Stories, who were then featured in the song (they were credited separately from Loeb). Loeb's neighbor and friend, actor [[Ethan Hawke]] found out about the song and submitted it to actor [[Ben Stiller]]'s directional film soundtrack ''[[Reality Bites]]'' which was then accepted. Musically, \"Stay\" is a pop rock song that was also influenced by folk music. Lyrically, the song deals with a relationship that is in trouble, but the singer tries to reconcile with her lover.\n\n\"Stay\" received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the lyrical and production side and the song's commercial potential. Several critics had listed the song in some of the best song lists. \"Stay\" ultimately went on to become a number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, earning her the distinction of being the first artist to top the US chart before being signed to any record label. The song was commercially successful in several other countries, including Canada, where it also reached number one, and in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was produced and directed by close friend [[Ethan Hawke]] who lived near her apartment in New York City. For their performance of the song Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories were nominated for a [[37th Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]], but lost to [[All-4-One]]'s \"I Swear\".\n\n==Background==\nBefore \"Stay\" was commercially released, Loeb had previous musical ventures. After graduating from high school in 1986, she went to [[Brown University]], where she graduated in 1990<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lisa-loeb-mn0000296802|title=Lisa Loeb \u2013 Biography, Albums, Streaming Links \u2013 AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> with a degree in [[comparative literature]]. At Brown, she and [[Elizabeth Mitchell (musician)|Elizabeth Mitchell]] formed a band named [[Liz and Lisa]],<ref name=\"hoehome\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lisaloeb.com/|title=Lisa Loeb|publisher=}}</ref> with future singer/songwriter and classmate [[Duncan Sheik]] as a guitarist. The duo released the albums ''Liz and Lisa'' (1989) and ''[[Liz and Lisa - Days Were Different]]'' (1990) independently.<ref name=\"amg\"/> After college, bassist Rick Lassiter and TV and drummer Chad Fisher joined the band. After developing a following together, Loeb and Mitchell parted ways a few years after college. While talking about her past musical ventures, Loeb said; \"When the song came out, though, I had been playing music since I was a little kid and I'd had gigs since high school, and I'd been making recordings for almost 10 years at that point. I didn't realize what an impact having a No. 1 single would have. It connects me with people of different ages, and I get to travel all over the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/lisa-loeb-58947|title=Lisa Loeb|date=28 July 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nShe attended [[Berklee School of Music]] in Boston for a session of summer school, and in 1990 formed a full band called Nine Stories. The band, which was named after the [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|book]] by [[J.D. Salinger]], included Tim Bright on guitar, Jonathan Feinberg on drums, and Joe Quigley on bass. Loeb began working with producer Juan Pati\u00f1o to make the cassette ''[[Purple Tape]]'' in 1992.<ref name=\"amg\"/> It included the earliest recordings of later popular tracks such as \"[[Do You Sleep?]],\" \"Snow Day,\" \"Train Songs,\" and \"It's Over.\"<ref name=\"hoehome\"/> Loeb sold the violet-colored cassette to fans at gigs and sent it to music industry promoters.<ref name=\"amg\"/> Loeb and her band also made a recording of her song \"Stay (I Missed You)\" during the same time.  Loeb originally intended for the song to be used by [[Daryl Hall]], whom she had heard was looking for songs for a solo project; before time the song was finished, however, she had been told Hall no longer needed additional music.  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/with-stay-lisa-loeb-taught-a-generation-how-screwed-1798271315 |title=With 'Stay', Lisa Loeb Taught a Generation How Screwed-Up Love Really Is |last=Patridge |first=Kenneth |publisher=[[The A.

But yeah, it was a story about a breakup I was going through, and that situation where it's gotten into your head too much..\"<ref name=\"songfacts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=507|title=Stay by Lisa Loeb Songfacts|publisher=}}</ref>\n:-Lisa Loeb talking about the inspiration of \"Stay (I Missed You)\"\n| width  = 20em\n| align  = left\n| quoted = 1\n}}\n\nMusically, \"Stay\" is a pop rock song with [[folk rock]] influence. Vocally, according to a publication, \"The tonal shifts in the vocals also are quite affecting. Loeb rants and rails through much of the song with barely contained emotion only to pull back for some tenderness in the refrain. It\u2019s an outstanding performance of an enduring song.\"<ref name=\"americansongwriter\"/> The song is structured around a central passage of sonic catharsis. After the tentative opening, the pace and density of Loeb's roiling litany of self-recrimination increases; the personal pronouns pile up; the accents of the bass and backing voices grow unruly and insistent, like nagging, negative thoughts heaping on one another.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nAccording to Rhik Samadder, Loeb's guitar picks out a simple arpeggio as she admonishes: \"You say I only hear what I want to,\" warning us that this may be the most self-involved song ever written. Almost every line contains a clutch of first person singulars: \"I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up, and this woman was singing my song.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Based on the song's theme the break-up song is not about a relationship with a departed lover, but the relationship with ourselves [...] About accepting that our basic loneliness is unsophisticated and shared, and that we have to abandon the selfish dramas of our malaise to properly love. It's a point of emotional development [...]\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Regarding the lyrical content, Loeb's explained; \"\"I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up, and this woman was singing my song,\" Lisa explains: \"That was when you hear somebody telling your exact story. It's funny, because it wasn't until later, after a couple of major breakups, that I realized when you're depressed and you're going through these breakups, the breakup was supposed to happen. If you're going through difficult times, it's hilarious how you turn on the radio and even the most clich\u00e9 things perfectly capture how you're feeling. And then you realize why people wrote those songs.\"<ref name=\"songfacts\"/>\n\nAccording to ''AmericanSongwriter.com'', \"Loeb's lyrics definitely capture the breathless way of expressing oneself that was common at the time. Considering all of the lines that start with \"And,\" the song can seem like one big run-on sentence. Yet in the midst of all of the breathlessness, she focuses enough to spin out several couplets that really nail the topsy-turvy feeling that romantic mind games can play on you.\"<ref name=\"americansongwriter\"/> According to the publication, they said that the lyric \"Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was/Dying since the day they were born/Well, this is not that/I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown.\" was \"poetic\".<ref name=\"americansongwriter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/09/lisa-loeb-stay-i-missed-you/|title=Lisa Loeb, \"Stay (I Missed You)\"  \u00ab American Songwriter|date=9 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Stay (I Missed You)\" received positive reviews from most [[music critics]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from [[Allmusic]] highlighted the track as an album highlight. He said that the song is \"gentle\" and explained \"That's because ''Tails'' delivers on the promise of \"Stay.\" While the basic folk-rock elements of the song are present, much of the material on the record doesn't sound like her breakthrough hit; there are some distorted guitars here and there, and she even rocks out a little bit.

He said \"\"Stay (I Missed You)\" took her from obscurity to minor celebrity when it was included on the soundtrack of Reality Bites [...] While Loeb never strayed very far from the sweet, gentle template she laid down with \"Stay (I Missed You),\" she always was friendly, melodic, and rather ingratiating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-lisa-loeb-mw0000471655|title=The Very Best Of \u2013 Lisa Loeb \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> From the ''Reality Bites'' soundtrack, \"Stay\" was the only song to be highlighted as an album standout.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-bites-mw0000110087 Reality Bites Soundtrack].

It was released in May 1994 as the lead single from the original movie soundtrack ''[[Reality Bites]]'' (1994). The song was written and composed by Loeb herself, while production was handled by Juan Pati\u00f1o and Loeb, who previously produced some of her songs back with Nine Stories. \"Stay\" was originally conceived in 1990 when she formed the band Nine Stories, who were then featured in the song (they were credited separately from Loeb). Loeb's neighbor and friend, actor [[Ethan Hawke]] found out about the song and submitted it to actor [[Ben Stiller]]'s directional film soundtrack ''[[Reality Bites]]'' which was then accepted. Musically, \"Stay\" is a pop rock song that was also influenced by folk music. Lyrically, the song deals with a relationship that is in trouble, but the singer tries to reconcile with her lover.\n\n\"Stay\" received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the lyrical and production side and the song's commercial potential. Several critics had listed the song in some of the best song lists. \"Stay\" ultimately went on to become a number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, earning her the distinction of being the first artist to top the US chart before being signed to any record label. The song was commercially successful in several other countries, including Canada, where it also reached number one, and in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was produced and directed by close friend [[Ethan Hawke]] who lived near her apartment in New York City. For their performance of the song Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories were nominated for a [[37th Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]], but lost to [[All-4-One]]'s \"I Swear\".\n\n==Background==\nBefore \"Stay\" was commercially released, Loeb had previous musical ventures. After graduating from high school in 1986, she went to [[Brown University]], where she graduated in 1990<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lisa-loeb-mn0000296802|title=Lisa Loeb \u2013 Biography, Albums, Streaming Links \u2013 AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> with a degree in [[comparative literature]]. At Brown, she and [[Elizabeth Mitchell (musician)|Elizabeth Mitchell]] formed a band named [[Liz and Lisa]],<ref name=\"hoehome\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lisaloeb.com/|title=Lisa Loeb|publisher=}}</ref> with future singer/songwriter and classmate [[Duncan Sheik]] as a guitarist. The duo released the albums ''Liz and Lisa'' (1989) and ''[[Liz and Lisa - Days Were Different]]'' (1990) independently.<ref name=\"amg\"/> After college, bassist Rick Lassiter and TV and drummer Chad Fisher joined the band. After developing a following together, Loeb and Mitchell parted ways a few years after college. While talking about her past musical ventures, Loeb said; \"When the song came out, though, I had been playing music since I was a little kid and I\u2019d had gigs since high school, and I\u2019d been making recordings for almost 10 years at that point. I didn\u2019t realize what an impact having a No. 1 single would have. It connects me with people of different ages, and I get to travel all over the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/lisa-loeb-58947|title=Lisa Loeb|date=28 July 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nShe attended [[Berklee School of Music]] in Boston for a session of summer school, and in 1990 formed a full band called Nine Stories. The band, which was named after the [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|book]] by [[J.D. Salinger]], included Tim Bright on guitar, Jonathan Feinberg on drums, and Joe Quigley on bass. Loeb began working with producer Juan Pati\u00f1o to make the cassette ''[[Purple Tape]]'' in 1992.<ref name=\"amg\"/> It included the earliest recordings of later popular tracks such as \u201c[[Do You Sleep?]],\u201d \u201cSnow Day,\u201d \u201cTrain Songs,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Over.\u201d<ref name=\"hoehome\"/> Loeb sold the violet-colored cassette to fans at gigs and sent it to music industry promoters.<ref name=\"amg\"/> Loeb and her band also made a recording of her song \"Stay (I Missed You)\" during the same time.  Loeb originally intended for the song to be used by [[Daryl Hall]], whom she had heard was looking for songs for a solo project; before time the song was finished, however, she had been told Hall no longer needed additional music.  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/with-stay-lisa-loeb-taught-a-generation-how-screwed-1798271315 |title=With \u2018Stay\u2019, Lisa Loeb Taught a Generation How Screwed-Up Love Really Is |last=Patridge |first=Kenneth |publisher=[[The A.

Vocally, according to a publication, \"The tonal shifts in the vocals also are quite affecting. Loeb rants and rails through much of the song with barely contained emotion only to pull back for some tenderness in the refrain. It\u2019s an outstanding performance of an enduring song.\"<ref name=\"americansongwriter\"/> The song is structured around a central passage of sonic catharsis. After the tentative opening, the pace and density of Loeb's roiling litany of self-recrimination increases; the personal pronouns pile up; the accents of the bass and backing voices grow unruly and insistent, like nagging, negative thoughts heaping on one another.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nAccording to Rhik Samadder, Loeb's guitar picks out a simple arpeggio as she admonishes: \"You say I only hear what I want to,\" warning us that this may be the most self-involved song ever written. Almost every line contains a clutch of first person singulars: \"I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up, and this woman was singing my song.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Based on the song's theme the break-up song is not about a relationship with a departed lover, but the relationship with ourselves [...] About accepting that our basic loneliness is unsophisticated and shared, and that we have to abandon the selfish dramas of our malaise to properly love. It's a point of emotional development [...]\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Regarding the lyrical content, Loeb's explained; \"\"I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up, and this woman was singing my song,\" Lisa explains: \"That was when you hear somebody telling your exact story. It's funny, because it wasn't until later, after a couple of major breakups, that I realized when you're depressed and you're going through these breakups, the breakup was supposed to happen. If you're going through difficult times, it's hilarious how you turn on the radio and even the most clich\u00e9 things perfectly capture how you're feeling. And then you realize why people wrote those songs.\"<ref name=\"songfacts\"/>\n\nAccording to ''AmericanSongwriter.com'', \"Loeb\u2019s lyrics definitely capture the breathless way of expressing oneself that was common at the time. Considering all of the lines that start with \u201cAnd,\u201d the song can seem like one big run-on sentence. Yet in the midst of all of the breathlessness, she focuses enough to spin out several couplets that really nail the topsy-turvy feeling that romantic mind games can play on you.\"<ref name=\"americansongwriter\"/> According to the publication, they said that the lyric \u201cSome of us hover when we weep for the other who was/Dying since the day they were born/Well, this is not that/I think that I\u2019m throwing, but I\u2019m thrown.\u201d was \"poetic\".<ref name=\"americansongwriter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/09/lisa-loeb-stay-i-missed-you/|title=Lisa Loeb, \"Stay (I Missed You)\"  \u00ab American Songwriter|date=9 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Stay (I Missed You)\" received positive reviews from most [[music critics]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from [[Allmusic]] highlighted the track as an album highlight. He said that the song is \"gentle\" and explained \"That's because ''Tails'' delivers on the promise of \"Stay.\" While the basic folk-rock elements of the song are present, much of the material on the record doesn't sound like her breakthrough hit; there are some distorted guitars here and there, and she even rocks out a little bit.

He said \"\"Stay (I Missed You)\" took her from obscurity to minor celebrity when it was included on the soundtrack of Reality Bites [...] While Loeb never strayed very far from the sweet, gentle template she laid down with \"Stay (I Missed You),\" she always was friendly, melodic, and rather ingratiating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-lisa-loeb-mw0000471655|title=The Very Best Of \u2013 Lisa Loeb \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> From the ''Reality Bites'' soundtrack, \"Stay\" was the only song to be highlighted as an album standout.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-bites-mw0000110087 Reality Bites Soundtrack].

He stated that Kelly's vocals were amazing and his lyrics seemed sincere, but that it felt like listening to more of a [[persona]] than to an attempt to address a sometimes messy life.<ref name=\"LeRoy\"/> In a mixed review, Neil Z Yeung of [[AllMusic]] gave the album 3 stars, stating the half of the songs on the album were made to be radio hits, and that it was toned down from Kelly's previous two albums.

It features vocals from American rapper [[Kanye West]]. The song was written by Estelle, West, [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir, and [[Keith Harris (record producer)|Keith Harris]]. It was produced by will.i.am, and uses the beat from the song \"Impatient\" from his own third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). \"American Boy\" is a breezy [[disco]]-[[funk]] song that lyrically describes a romance with an American suitor. The song's conception came after Legend, Estelle's mentor, suggested she write a song about meeting an American man.\n\n\"American Boy\" was released by [[Atlantic Records]] as the album's second single on 31 March 2008. The song received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised its fresh sound and production. The song reached the top five in many European and Oceanic markets, and peaked at number-one in Belgium and Estelle's native United Kingdom. It also achieved success in the United States, peaking at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and becoming Estelle's breakout song in the country. The song earned many nominations, and ultimately won a [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. The music video, featuring a variety of celebrity guests, earned a [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Award]] nomination for Best UK Video. Estelle and West performed the song at the [[2008 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]]. \"American Boy\" was featured in the 2009 film  ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]''.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Quote box|width=330px|align=left|quote=\"It\u2019s a song as breezy as air, so carefree its gorgeously channeled vocals practically float off from the grounded four-on-the-floor disco beat and Quincy-Jones-producing-Michael-Jackson funk bass.

It features vocals from American rapper [[Kanye West]]. The song was written by Estelle, West, [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir, and [[Keith Harris (record producer)|Keith Harris]]. It was produced by will.i.am, and uses the beat from the song \"Impatient\" from his own third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). \"American Boy\" is a breezy [[disco]]-[[funk]] song that lyrically describes a romance with an American suitor. The song's conception came after Legend, Estelle's mentor, suggested she write a song about meeting an American man.\n\n\"American Boy\" was released by [[Atlantic Records]] as the album's second single on 31 March, 2008. The song received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised its fresh sound and production. The song reached the top five in many European and Oceanic markets, and peaked at number-one in Belgium and Estelle's native United Kingdom. It also achieved success in the United States, peaking at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and becoming Estelle's breakout song in the country.

He was the son of emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen dynasty]] and of [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance]], heiress to the [[Hauteville family|Norman kings of Sicily]].\n\n[[File:Arms of Swabia.svg|thumb|100px|right|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen.]]\n[[File:Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (Hohenstaufen).svg|thumb|100px|right|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen as Holy Roman Emperor.]]\n[[File:Dominions of Friedrick II (Kingdom of Sicily, Holy Roman Empire, Kingdom of Jerusalem).png|thumb|220px|The dominions of Frederick II.]]\n\nHis political and cultural ambitions were enormous as he ruled a vast area, beginning with Sicily and stretching through Italy all the way north to Germany. As the [[Crusades]] progressed, he acquired control of Jerusalem and styled himself its king. However, the [[Papacy]] became his enemy, and it eventually prevailed. Viewing himself as a direct successor to the [[Roman emperor]]s of antiquity,<ref>\"His dream of universal power made him regard himself as an emperor of classical times and a direct successor to [[Augustus]]\", notes Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:12.</ref> he was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]] from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death; he was also a claimant to the title of [[King of the Romans]] from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. As such, he was [[King of Germany]], [[King of Italy|of Italy]], and [[King of Burgundy|of Burgundy]]. At the age of three, he was crowned [[Kingdom of Sicily|King of Sicily]] as a co-ruler with his mother, [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Hauteville]], the daughter of [[Roger II of Sicily]]. His other royal title was [[King of Jerusalem]] by virtue of marriage and his connection with the [[Sixth Crusade]]. Frequently at war with the papacy, which was hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (the ''Regno'') to the south, he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] three times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and after. [[Pope Gregory IX]] went so far as to call him an [[Antichrist]].\n\nSpeaking six languages (Latin, Sicilian, [[Middle High German]], [[Langues d'o\u00efl]], Greek and Arabic<ref>Cronica, [[Giovanni Villani]] [http://www.elfinspell.com/VillaniBk6a.html Book VI e. 1.] (Rose E.

His [[Sicilians|Sicilian]] royal court in [[Palermo]], beginning around 1220, saw the first use of a literary form of an [[Italo-Romance]] language, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern [[Italian language]].<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ8KB0YifC4C |title=Sicily: An Informal History |last=Sammartino |first=Peter |last2=Roberts |first2=William |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Associated University Presse |isbn=9780845348772}}</ref> He was also the first king to formally outlaw [[trial by ordeal]], which had come to be viewed as superstitious.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore?|url= http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |archivedate=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter his death his line did not survive, and the [[House of Hohenstaufen]] came to an end.

Some chronicles say that Constance gave birth to him in a public square in order to forestall any doubt about his origin such as son of a butcher. Frederick was baptised in [[Assisi]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nAt birth Frederick was named Constantine by his mother.{{sfn|Kantorowicz|1937|p=8}}{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=62}}{{efn|There is some doubt of this because the sources are not exactly contemporary.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} The ''[[Annales Stadenses]]'' and ''[[Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis]]'' both record his birth name.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}}} This name, a masculine form of his mother's name, served to identify him closely with both his Norman heritage and his imperial heritage (through [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor).{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|pp=89\u201390}} It was still his name at the time of his election as [[King of the Romans]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}{{sfn|Kantorowicz|1937|p=11}} He was only given his grandfathers' names, becoming Frederick Roger (or Roger Frederick), at his baptism when he was two years old.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}{{efn|His double name at baptism is recorded by [[Roger of Howden]] and the fact that the order was not important is made clear in the ''[[Annales Casinenses]]''.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}} Houben, however, believes that he was probably only baptized under the name Frederick.{{sfn|Houben|2002|p=174}}}} This dual name served the same purpose as Constantine: emphasising his dual heritage.{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nFrederick's birth was accompanied by gossip and rumour on account of his mother's advanced age. According to [[Albert of Stade]] and [[Salimbene]], he was not the son of Henry and Constance but was presented to Henry as his own after a faked pregnancy. His real father was variously described as a butcher of Jesi, a physician, a miller or a falconer. Frederick's birth was also associated with a prophecy of [[Merlin]]. According to [[Andrea Dandolo]], writing at some distance but probably recording contemporary gossip, Henry doubted reports of his wife's pregnancy and was only convinced by consulting [[Joachim of Fiore]], who confirmed that Frederick was his son by interpretation of Merlin's prophecy and the [[Erythraean Sibyl]]. A later legend claims that Constance gave birth in the public square of Jesi to silence doubters. None of these stories have any validity, although it is clear that Constance took unusual measures to prove her pregnancy and its legitimacy. [[Roger of Howden]] reports that she swore on the gospels before a [[papal legate]] that Frederick was her son and Henry's. It is probable that these public acts of affirmation on account of her age gave rise to some false rumours.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|pp=13\u201316}}\n\n==Early years==\nIn 1196 at [[Frankfurt am Main]] the infant Frederick was elected King of the Romans and thus heir to his father's imperial crown. His rights in Germany were [[German throne dispute|to end up disputed]] by Henry's brother [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]]. At the death of his father in 1197, Frederick was in Italy, traveling towards Germany, when the bad news reached his guardian, [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Spoleto]]. Frederick was hastily brought back to his mother Constance in Palermo, Sicily, where he was crowned king on 17 May 1198, at just three years of age.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nConstance of Sicily was in her own right queen of Sicily, and she established herself as [[regent]]. Upon Constance's death in 1198, [[Pope Innocent III]] succeeded as Frederick's guardian. Frederick's tutor during this period was [[Honorius III|Cencio]], who would become Pope Honorius III.<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1193.htm#Cencio FIU.edu]</ref> [[Markward von Annweiler|Markward of Annweiler]], with the support of Henry's brother, [[Philip of Swabia]], reclaimed the regency for himself and soon after invaded the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1200, with the help of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese ships]], he landed in Sicily and one year later seized the young Frederick.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} He thus ruled Sicily until 1202, when he was succeeded by another German captain, [[William of Capparone]], who kept Frederick under his control in the royal palace of Palermo until 1206. Frederick was subsequently under tutor [[Walter of Palearia]], until, in 1208, he was declared of age. His first task was to reassert his power over Sicily and southern Italy, where local barons and adventurers had usurped most of the authority.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Posse Band 1 b 0063.jpg|thumb|Seals used by Frederick as Emperor (ed.

In southern Italy, Otto became the champion of those noblemen and barons who feared Frederick's increasingly strong measures to check their power, such as the dismissal of the pro-noble Walter of Palearia. The new emperor invaded Italy, where he reached [[Calabria]] without meeting much resistance.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nIn response, Innocent sided against Otto, and in September 1211 at the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] Frederick was elected ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as German King by a rebellious faction backed by the pope. Innocent also excommunicated Otto, who was forced to return to Germany.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Frederick sailed to [[Gaeta]] with a small following. He agreed with the pope on a future separation between the Sicilian and Imperial titles, and named his wife Constance as regent. Passing through [[Lombardy]] and [[Engadin]], he reached [[Konstanz]] in September 1212, preceding Otto by a few hours.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nFrederick was crowned as king on 9 December 1212 in [[Mainz]]. Frederick's authority in Germany remained tenuous, and he was recognized only in southern Germany. In the region of northern Germany, the center of [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] power, Otto continued to hold the reins of royal and imperial power despite his excommunication. Otto's decisive military defeat at the [[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines]] forced him to withdraw to the Guelph hereditary lands where, virtually without supporters, he died in 1218.<ref name=\"Toch381\" />\n\nThe German princes, supported by Innocent III, again elected Frederick king of Germany in 1215, and he was crowned king in [[Aachen]] on 23 July 1215 by one of the three German archbishops. It was not until another five years had passed, and only after further negotiations between Frederick, Innocent III, and [[Pope Honorius III|Honorius III]] \u2013 who succeeded to the papacy after Innocent's death in 1216 \u2013 that Frederick was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Honorius III, on 22 November 1220.<ref name=\"Toch381\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welfs, Hohenstaufen and Habsburgs |first=Michael |last=Toch |encyclopedia=The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 1198 \u2013 c. 1300 |volume=5 |editor-first1=David |editor-last1=Abulafia |editor-first2=Rosamond |editor-last2=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=381}}</ref> At the same time, Frederick's oldest son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry]] took the title of King of the Romans.<ref name=\"Toch381\" />\n\nUnlike most Holy Roman emperors, Frederick spent few years in Germany. In 1218, he helped King [[Philip II of France]] and [[Odo III, Duke of Burgundy]], to bring an end to the [[War of Succession (Champagne)|War of Succession]] in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] (France) by invading [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], capturing and burning [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], capturing [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine]] and forcing him to withdraw his support from [[Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt]]. After his coronation in 1220, Frederick remained either in the Kingdom of Sicily or on [[Crusade]] until 1236, when he made his last journey to Germany. He returned to Italy in 1237 and stayed there for the remaining thirteen years of his life, represented in Germany by his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]].\n\nIn the Kingdom of Sicily, he built on the reform of the laws begun at the [[Assizes of Ariano]] in 1140 by his grandfather [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. His initiative in this direction was visible as early as the [[Assizes of Capua]] (1220, issued soon after his coronation in Rome) but came to fruition in his promulgation of the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] (1231, also known as ''[[Liber Augustalis]]''), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and was a source of inspiration for a long time after. It made the Kingdom of Sicily an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist monarchy]]; it also set a precedent for the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the ''Liber Augustalis'' remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819.\n\n==The Fifth Crusade and early policies in northern Italy==\n[[File:Augustale.jpg|thumb|left|An [[augustale]] coin of Frederick II, from the [[Messina]] mint of Sicily, struck some time after 1231]]\n\nAt the time he was elected King of the Romans, Frederick promised to go on [[Fifth Crusade|crusade]]. He continually delayed, however, and, in spite of his renewal of this vow at his coronation as the King of Germany, he did not travel to [[Egypt]] with the armies of the [[Fifth Crusade]] in 1217. He sent forces to Egypt under the command of [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria]], but constant expectation of his arrival caused papal legate [[Pelagio Galvani|Pelagius]] to reject [[Ayyubid]] sultan [[Al-Kamil]]'s offer to restore the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem to the crusaders in exchange for their withdrawal from Egypt and caused the Crusade to continually stall in anticipation of his ever-delayed arrival. The crusade ended in failure with the loss of [[Damietta]] in 1221.<ref>Madden, Thomas F. ''The New Concise History of the Crusades''.

Those assembled responded with the reformation of the [[Lombard League]], which had already defeated his grandfather [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in the 12th century, and again [[Milan]] was chosen as the league's leader. The Diet was cancelled, however, and the situation was stabilized only through a compromise reached by Honorius between Frederick and the league.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} During his sojourn in northern Italy, Frederick also invested the [[Teutonic Order]] with the territories in what would become [[East Prussia]], starting what was later called the [[Northern Crusade]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n==The Sixth Crusade==\n{{Main|Sixth Crusade}}\n[[File:Al-Kamil Muhammad al-Malik and Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor.jpg|thumb|Frederick II (left) meets [[Al-Kamil]] (right). ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'', c. 1348.]]\nProblems of stability within the empire delayed Frederick's departure on crusade. It was not until 1225, when, by proxy, Frederick had married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]], heiress to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], that his departure seemed assured. Frederick immediately saw to it that his new father-in-law [[John of Brienne]], the current king of Jerusalem, was dispossessed and his rights transferred to the emperor. In August 1227, Frederick set out for the Holy Land from [[Brindisi]] but was forced to return when he was struck down by an epidemic that had broken out. Even the master of the [[Teutonic Knights]], [[Hermann of Salza]], recommended that he return to the mainland to recuperate. On 29 September 1227, Frederick was excommunicated by [[Pope Gregory IX]] for failing to honor his crusading pledge.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nMany contemporary chroniclers doubted the sincerity of Frederick's illness, and their attitude may be explained by their pro-papal leanings. [[Roger of Wendover]], a chronicler of the time, wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=... he went to the Mediterranean sea, and embarked with a small retinue; but after pretending to make for the holy land for three days, he said that he was seized with a sudden illness... this conduct of the emperor redounded much to his disgrace, and to the injury of the whole business of the crusade.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Roger of Wendover|title= Christian Society and the Crusades|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/christiansociety0000pete|chapter-url-access=registration|editor= Peters|year=1971|location=Philadelphia|publisher= Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref>}}\n\nFrederick eventually sailed again from Brindisi in June 1228. The pope, still Gregory IX, regarded that action as a provocation, since, as an excommunicate, Frederick was technically not capable of conducting a Crusade, and he excommunicated the emperor a second time. Frederick reached [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in September. Many of the local nobility, the Templars, and Hospitallers were therefore reluctant to offer overt support. Since the crusading army was already a small force, Frederick negotiated along the lines of a previous agreement he had intended to broker with the [[Ayyubid]] sultan, [[Al-Kamil]]. The [[Treaty of Jaffa and Tell Ajul|treaty]], signed in February 1229, resulted in the [[restitution]] of Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], [[Bethlehem]], and a small coastal strip to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, though there are disagreements as to the extent of the territory returned.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n[[File:Regensburg - Historisches Museum - Friedrich II..JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Frederick II from the Black Tower of [[Regensburg]], {{circa|1280\u20131290}}.]]\nThe treaty also stipulated that the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] were to remain under Muslim control and that the city of Jerusalem would remain without fortifications.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Virtually all other crusaders, including the Templars and Hospitallers, condemned this deal as a political ploy on the part of Frederick to regain his kingdom while betraying the cause of the Crusaders. Al-Kamil, who was nervous about possible war with his relatives who ruled [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]], wished to avoid further trouble from the Christians, at least until his domestic rivals were subdued.\n\nThe crusade ended in a truce and in Frederick's coronation as [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] on 18 March 1229, although this was technically improper. Frederick's wife Isabella, the heiress, had died, leaving their infant son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]] as rightful king. There is also disagreement as to whether the \"coronation\" was a coronation at all, as a letter written by Frederick to [[Henry III of England]] suggests that the crown he placed on his own head was in fact the imperial crown of the Romans.\n\nAt his coronation, he may have worn the red silk mantle that had been crafted during the reign of Roger II.{{cn|date=March 2019}} It bore an Arabic inscription indicating that the robe dated from the year 528 in the Muslim calendar, and incorporated a generic benediction, wishing its wearer \"vast prosperity, great generosity and high splendor, fame and magnificent endowments, and the fulfillment of his wishes and hopes. May his days and nights go in pleasure without end or change.\" This coronation robe can be found today in the ''Schatzkammer'' of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.\n\nIn any case, [[Gerald of Lausanne]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], did not attend the ceremony; indeed, the next day the [[Bishop of Caesarea]] arrived to place the city under interdict on the patriarch's orders. Frederick's further attempts to rule over the Kingdom of Jerusalem were met by resistance on the part of the barons, led by [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut]]. In the mid-1230s, Frederick's viceroy was forced to leave Acre, and in 1244, following a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1244)|siege]], Jerusalem itself was lost again to a new Muslim offensive.\n\nWhilst Frederick's seeming bloodless recovery of Jerusalem for the cross brought him great prestige in some European circles, his decision to complete the crusade while excommunicated provoked Church hostility. Although in 1230 the Pope lifted Frederick's excommunication at the [[Treaty of Ceprano (1230)|Treaty of Ceprano]], this decision was taken for a variety of reasons related to the political situation in Europe. Of Frederick's crusade, [[Philip of Novara]], a chronicler of the period, said, \"The emperor left Acre [after the conclusion of the truce]; hated, cursed, and vilified.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Peters |title=The History of Philip of Novara |encyclopedia=Christian Society and the Crusades |location=Philadelphia |year=1971}}</ref> Overall this crusade, arguably the first successful one since the [[First Crusade]], was adversely affected by the manner in which Frederick carried out negotiations without the support of the church. He left behind a kingdom in the Levant torn between his agents and the local nobility, a civil war known as the [[War of the Lombards]].\n\nThe itinerant [[Joachimite]] preachers and many radical [[Franciscan]]s, the [[Franciscan Spirituals|Spirituals]], supported Frederick. Against the interdict pronounced on his lands, the preachers condemned the Pope and continued to minister the sacraments and grant absolutions. Brother Arnold in [[Swabia]] proclaimed the [[Second Coming]] for 1260, at which time Frederick would then confiscate the riches of Rome and distribute them among the poor, the \"only true Christians.\"<ref>[[Marvin Harris]], ''Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches'', Chapter 10 <!-- pp. 196 and 197 out of 235 in my translated edition. --></ref>\n\n==The war against the Pope and Henry's revolt==\nDuring Frederick's stay in the Holy Land, his regent, Rainald of Spoleto, had attacked the [[Marche]] and the [[Duchy of Spoleto]]. Gregory IX recruited an army under [[John of Brienne]] and, in 1229, invaded southern Italy. His troops overcame an initial resistance at [[Montecassino]] and reached [[Apulia]]. Frederick arrived at Brindisi in June 1229. He quickly recovered the lost territories, and tried and condemned the rebel barons, but avoided crossing the borders of the Papal States.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} \n\nThe war came to an end with the [[Treaty of Ceprano (1230)|Treaty of Ceprano]] in the summer of 1230; the emperor personally met Gregory IX at [[Anagni]], making some concessions to the church in Sicily.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} He also issued the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] (August 1231), as an attempt to solve the political and administrative problems of the country, which had dramatically been shown by the recent war.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nWhile he may have temporarily made his peace with the pope, Frederick found the German princes another matter. Frederick's son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]] (who was born 1211 in Sicily, son of Frederick's first wife [[Constance of Aragon]]) had caused their discontent with an aggressive policy against their privileges. This forced Henry to a complete capitulation, and the ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' (\"Statutes in favor of the princes\"), issued at Worms, deprived the emperor of much of his sovereignty in Germany.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Frederick summoned Henry to a meeting, which was held at [[Aquileia]] in 1232. Henry confirmed his submission, but Frederick was nevertheless compelled to confirm the ''Statutum'' at [[Cividale]] soon afterwards.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nThe situation for Frederick was also problematic in Lombardy, after all the emperor's attempts to restore the imperial authority in Lombardy with the help of Gregory IX (at the time, ousted from Rome by a revolt) turned to nothing in 1233. In the meantime Henry in Germany had returned to an anti-princes policy, against his father's will: Frederick thus obtained his excommunication from Gregory IX (July 1234). Henry tried to muster an opposition in Germany and asked the Lombard cities to block the Alpine passes. In May 1235, Frederick went to Germany, taking no army with him: as soon as July, however, he was able to force his son to renounce to the crown all his lands, at Worms, and then imprisoned him.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nIn Germany the Hohenstaufen and the Guelphs reconciled in 1235. [[Otto the Child]], the grandson of [[Henry the Lion]], had been deposed as Duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1180, conveying the allodial Guelphic possessions to Frederick, who in return [[enfeoffed]] Otto with the same lands and additional former imperial possessions as the newly established Duke of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], ending the unclear status of the German Guelphs, who had been left without title and rank after 1180.\n\n==The war for Lombardy and Italy==\n[[File:Cortenuova1237.JPG|thumb|260px|right|The victorious [[Battle of Cortenuova]] against the [[Lombard League|2nd Lombard League]] (1237), ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).]]\n[[File:Federico II platba.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Frederick II's troops paid with leather coins during the sieges of [[Siege of Brescia|Brescia]] and [[siege of Faenza|Faenza]],<ref name=WIP>{{cite book|title=Medieval European Coinage: Vol. 14 |first=Philip |last=Gierson |year=1998 |place=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).]]\n\nWith peace north of the Alps, Frederick raised an army from the German princes to suppress the rebel cities in Lombardy. Gregory tried to stop the invasion with diplomatic moves, but in vain. During his descent to Italy, Frederick had to divert his troops to quell a rebellion of [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]]. At [[Vienna]], in February 1237, he obtained the title of [[King of the Romans]] for his 9-year-old son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nAfter the failure of the negotiations between the Lombard cities, the pope and the imperial diplomats, Frederick invaded Lombardy from [[Verona]]. In November 1237 he won the decisive [[Battle of Cortenuova|battle in Cortenuova]] over the Lombard League. Frederick celebrated it with a triumph in [[Cremona]] in the manner of an ancient [[Roman emperor]], with the captured ''[[carroccio]]'' (later sent to the commune of Rome) and an elephant. He rejected any suit for peace, even from [[Milan]], which had sent a great sum of money. This demand of total surrender spurred further resistance from Milan, [[Brescia]], [[Bologna]], and [[Piacenza]], and in October 1238 he was forced to raise the [[siege of Brescia]], in the course of which his enemies had tried unsuccessfully to capture him.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nFrederick received the news of his excommunication by Gregory IX in the first months of 1239<ref name=\"bressler\">{{cite book | last = Bressler | first = Richard | title = Frederick II : the wonder of the world | publisher = Westholme | location = Yardley, Pennsylvania | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781594161094 }}</ref>{{rp|149}} while his court was in [[Padua]]<ref>Busk, pp. 455-458.</ref> The emperor responded by expelling the [[Minorite|Franciscans]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] from Lombardy and electing his son [[Enzo of Sardinia|Enzo]] as Imperial vicar for Northern Italy.<ref name=\"csun\">{{Cite web|title=Sede Vacante 1241\u20131243 |last=Adams |first=John P |work=csun.edu |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2014 |url= http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1241-b.html}}</ref> Enzo soon annexed the [[Romagna]], [[March of Ancona|Marche]], and the [[Duchy of Spoleto]], nominally part of the [[Papal States]].

In January 1240, Frederick triumphantly entered [[Foligno]] followed by [[Viterbo]], whence he aimed to finally conquer Rome to restore the ancient splendours of the Empire. Frederick's plan to attack Rome at that time, however, did not come to fruition as he chose to leave for southern Italy where a papal incited rebellion flared in Apulia. In southern Italy, Frederick attacked and razed [[Citt\u00e0 Sant'Angelo|St Angelo]] and [[Benevento]].<ref>Busk, pp. 8-11.</ref>\n\n[[File:ChronicaMajora-Giglio1241-MatthewParis-HenryIII(1259).PNG|thumb|right|320px|[[Battle of Giglio (1241)|Battle of Giglio]], against [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] (1241), miniature in ''[[Chronica Maiora]]'' (1259).]]\n\nIn the meantime the [[Ghibelline]] city of [[Ferrara]] had fallen, and Frederick swept his way northwards capturing [[Ravenna]] and, after [[Siege of Faenza|another long siege]], [[Faenza]]. The people of [[Forl\u00ec]], which had kept its Ghibelline stance even after the collapse of [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] power, offered their loyal support during the capture of the rival city: as a sign of gratitude, they were granted an augmentation of the communal coat-of-arms with the Hohenstaufen eagle, together with other privileges.

He was a member of a noble Imperial family and had some relatives in Frederick's camp, so the Emperor was initially happy with his election. Innocent, however, was to become his fiercest enemy. Negotiations began in the summer of 1243, but the situation changed as [[Viterbo]] rebelled, instigated by the intriguing local cardinal [[Ranieri Capocci]]. Frederick could not afford to lose his main stronghold near Rome, so he [[Siege of Viterbo|besieged the city]].{{sfn|Kamp|1975}}\n\nInnocent convinced the rebels to sign a peace but, after Frederick withdrew his garrison, Ranieri had them slaughtered on 13 November. Frederick was enraged. The new Pope was a master diplomat, and Frederick signed a peace treaty, which was soon broken. Innocent showed his true Guelph face, and, together with most of the Cardinals, fled via Genoese galleys to [[Liguria]], arriving on 7 July. His aim was to reach [[Lyon]], where a new council was being held since 24 June 1245.{{sfn|Kamp|1975}}\n\nDespite initially appearing that the council could end with a compromise, the intervention of Ranieri, who had a series of insulting pamphlets published against Frederick (in which, among other things, he defined the emperor as a heretic and an Antichrist), led the prelates towards a less accommodating solution.{{sfn|Kamp|1975}} One month later, Innocent IV declared Frederick to be deposed as emperor, characterising him as a \"friend of Babylon's sultan,\" \"of Saracen customs,\" \"provided with a harem guarded by [[eunuchs]],\" like the schismatic emperor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], and in sum a \"heretic.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120510045457/http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum13.htm#Bull#Bull Papal bull of excommunication of Frederick II]</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick-ii-excommunicated-by-pope-innocent-iv1.jpg|left|thumb|Frederick II being excommunicated by [[Pope Innocent IV]]]]\n\nThe Pope backed [[Heinrich Raspe]], [[landgrave of Thuringia]], as rival for the imperial crown and set in motion a plot to kill Frederick and Enzo, with the support of the pope's brother-in-law Orlando de Rossi, another friend of Frederick. The plotters were unmasked by the count of [[Caserta]], however, and the city of [[Altavilla Silentina|Altavilla]], where they had found shelter, was razed. The guilty were blinded, mutilated, and burnt alive or hanged. An attempt to invade the Kingdom of Sicily, under the command of Ranieri, was halted at [[Spello]] by Marino of Eboli, Imperial vicar of Spoleto.\n\nInnocent also sent a flow of money to Germany to cut off Frederick's power at its source. The [[archbishops of Cologne]] and [[archbishop of Mainz|Mainz]] also declared Frederick deposed, and in May 1246 Heinrich Raspe was chosen as the new king. On 5 August 1246 Heinrich, thanks to the Pope's money, managed to defeat an army of Conrad, son of Frederick, near [[Frankfurt]]. Frederick strengthened his position in Southern Germany, however, acquiring the [[Duchy of Austria]], whose duke had died without heirs. A year later Heinrich died, and the new [[anti-king]] was [[William II of Holland]].\n\nBetween February and March 1247 Frederick settled the situation in Italy by means of the diet of [[Terni]], naming his relatives or friends as vicars of the various lands. He married his son Manfred to the daughter of [[Amadeus IV of Savoy|Amedeo di Savoia]] and secured the submission of the marquis of [[Monferrato]]. On his part, Innocent asked protection from the King of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], but the king was a friend of the Emperor and believed in his desire for peace. A papal army under the command of [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]] never reached Lombardy, and the Emperor, accompanied by a massive army, held the next diet in [[Turin]].\n\n==Battle of Parma==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | footer = \n | image1 = Federico II Parma.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The unexpected sally of the Guelph cavalry from Parma against Vittoria{{cn|date=March 2019}}<!--Nuova Cronica??-->\n | image2 = Enzo Codice Chigi.JPG\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = [[Battle of Fossalta]] against the [[Lombard League|2nd Lombard League]] (1249), ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).\n }}\n\nAn unexpected event was to change the situation dramatically. In June 1247 the important Lombard city of Parma expelled the Imperial functionaries and sided with the Guelphs. Enzo was not in the city and could do nothing more than ask for help from his father, who came back to lay siege to the rebels, together with his friend [[Ezzelino III da Romano]], tyrant of [[Verona]]. The besieged languished as the Emperor waited for them to surrender from starvation. He had a wooden city, which he called \"Vittoria\", built around the walls.\n\nOn 18 February 1248, during one of these absences, the camp was suddenly assaulted and taken, and in the ensuing [[Battle of Parma]] the Imperial side was routed. Frederick lost the Imperial treasure and with it any hope of maintaining the impetus of his struggle against the rebellious communes and against the pope, who began plans for a crusade against Sicily. Frederick soon recovered and rebuilt an army, but this defeat encouraged resistance in many cities that could no longer bear the fiscal burden of his regime: Romagna, Marche and Spoleto were lost.\n\nIn February 1249 Frederick fired his advisor and prime minister, the famous jurist and poet [[Pier delle Vigne]], on charges of peculation and [[embezzlement]]. Some historians suggest that Pier was planning to betray the Emperor, who, according to [[Matthew of Paris]], cried when he discovered the plot. Pier, blinded and in chains, died in Pisa, possibly by his own hand. Even more shocking for Frederick was the capture of his natural son [[Enzo of Sardinia]] by the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] at the [[Battle of Fossalta]], in May 1249. Enzo was held in a palace in Bologna, where he remained captive until his death in 1272.\n\nFrederick lost another son, Richard of [[Chieti]]. The struggle continued: the Empire lost [[Como]] and [[Modena]], but regained [[Ravenna]]. An army sent to invade the Kingdom of Sicily under the command of Cardinal Pietro Capocci was crushed in the Marche at the [[Battle of Cingoli]] in 1250. In the first month of that year the indomitable Ranieri of Viterbo died and the Imperial ''condottieri'' again reconquered Romagna, the Marche and Spoleto; and [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad, King of the Romans]], scored several victories in Germany against William of Holland.\n\n[[File:Tomb of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor - Cathedral of Palermo - Italy 2015.jpg|thumb|left|155px|The sarcophagus of Frederick II in the [[Cathedral of Palermo]]]]\n\nFrederick did not take part in of any of these campaigns. He had been ill and likely felt tired. Despite the betrayals and the setbacks he had faced in his last years, Frederick died peacefully, wearing the habit of a [[Cistercian]] monk, on 13 December 1250 in [[Castel Fiorentino]] (territory of [[Torremaggiore]]), in [[Apulia]], after an attack of [[dysentery]].\n\nAt the time of his death, his preeminent position in Europe was challenged but not lost: his testament left his legitimate son Conrad the Imperial and Sicilian crowns. Manfred received the principality of [[Taranto]] and the government of the Kingdom, Henry the [[Kingdom of Arles]] or that of [[Jerusalem]], while the son of [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]] was entrusted with the Duchy of Austria and the [[March of Styria]]. Frederick's will stipulated that all the lands he had taken from the Church were to be returned to it, all the prisoners freed, and the taxes reduced, provided this did not damage the Empire's prestige.\n\nHowever, upon Conrad's death a mere four years later, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell from power and the [[Holy Roman Empire#Interregnum|Great Interregnum]] began, lasting until 1273, one year after the last Hohenstaufen, Enzo, had died in his prison. During this time, a legend developed that Frederick was [[King asleep in mountain|not truly dead but merely sleeping]] in the [[Kyffh\u00e4user]] Mountains and would one day awaken to reestablish his empire. Over time, this legend largely transferred itself to his grandfather, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also known as ''Barbarossa'' (\"Redbeard\").<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Medieval Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmedieva0000davi|url-access=registration|author=Ralph Henry Carless Davis, Robert Ian Moore|year=1957}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2014}}\n\nHis [[sarcophagus]] (made of red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]) lies in the [[cathedral of Palermo]] beside those of his parents (Henry VI and Constance) as well as his grandfather, the [[Normans|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily]].

They argue that Frederick understood himself as a Christian monarch in the sense of a [[Byzantine emperor]], thus as God's \"[[viceroy]]\" on earth.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Whatever his personal feelings toward religion, certainly submission to the pope did not enter into the matter in the slightest.

David Abulafia, in a biography subtitled \"A Medieval Emperor,\" argues that Frederick's reputation as an enlightened figure ahead of his time is undeserved, and that Frederick was mostly a conventionally Christian monarch who sought to rule in a conventional medieval manner.{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=436}}\n\n==Family==\nFrederick left numerous children, legitimate and illegitimate:\n\n===Legitimate issue===\n* First wife: [[Constance of Aragon, Holy Roman Empress|Constance of Aragon]] (1179 \u2013 23 June 1222).<ref name=\"Runciman26\">Steven Runciman, ''The Sicilian Vespers'', (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 26.</ref> Marriage: 15 August 1209, at [[Messina]], Sicily.\n** [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry (VII)]] (1211 \u2013 12 February 1242).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" />\n* Second wife: [[Yolande of Jerusalem]] (1212 \u2013 25 April 1228).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" /> Marriage: 9 November 1225, at [[Brindisi]], Apulia.\n** Margareta (November 1226 \u2013 August 1227).\n** [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (25 April 1228 \u2013 21 May 1254).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" />\n* Third wife: [[Isabella of England]] (1214 \u2013 1 December 1241).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" /> Marriage: 15 July 1235, at Worms, Germany.\n** Jordan (born during the Spring of 1236, failed to survive the year);<ref>Thomas Curtis Van Cleve's ''The Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen: Immutator Mundi'' (Oxford, 1972). p. 381: \"Certainly there is some evidence that a son, Jordanus, was born in the year 1236, and died shortly afterwards, but the only son of Frederick II and Isabella of England whose birth can be firmly established was a second Henry, born in 1238, and named after his uncle, Henry III, the King of England.\"</ref> this child was given the baptismal name Jordanus as he was baptized with water brought for that purpose from the Jordan river.\n** Agnes (b and d. 1237).\n** Henry (18 February 1238 \u2013 May 1253), named after [[Henry III of England]], his uncle; appointed Governor of Sicily and promised to become [[List of kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] after his father died, but he, too, died within three years and was never crowned.

Frequently at war with the papacy, which was hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (the ''Regno'') to the south, he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] three times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and after. [[Pope Gregory IX]] went so far as to call him an [[Antichrist]].\n\nSpeaking six languages (Latin, Sicilian, [[Middle High German]], [[Langues d'o\u00efl]], Greek and Arabic<ref>Cronica, [[Giovanni Villani]] [http://www.elfinspell.com/VillaniBk6a.html Book VI e. 1.] (Rose E. Selfe's English translation)</ref>), Frederick was an avid patron of science and the arts. He played a major role in promoting literature through the [[Sicilian School]] of poetry. His [[Sicilians|Sicilian]] royal court in [[Palermo]], beginning around 1220, saw the first use of a literary form of an [[Italo-Romance]] language, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern [[Italian language]].<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ8KB0YifC4C |title=Sicily: An Informal History |last=Sammartino |first=Peter |last2=Roberts |first2=William |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Associated University Presse |isbn=9780845348772}}</ref> He was also the first king to formally outlaw [[trial by ordeal]], which had come to be viewed as superstitious.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore?|url= http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |archivedate=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter his death his line did not survive, and the [[House of Hohenstaufen]] came to an end.

He was known as the ''puer Apuliae'' (son of [[Apulia]]).{{efn|The name is the chapter heading for his early years in Kantorowicz.}} His mother [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]] gave birth to him at the age of 40, and [[Boccaccio]] related in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' about the empress: as a Sicilian princess and paternal aunt of [[William II of Sicily]], a prediction that \"her marriage would destroy Sicily\" led to her confinement in a convent as a nun from childhood to remain celibate{{dubious|reason=The article on her says this is not true.|date=April 2020}} and her late engagement to Henry at the age of 30. Some chronicles say that Constance gave birth to him in a public square in order to forestall any doubt about his origin such as son of a butcher. Frederick was baptised in [[Assisi]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nAt birth Frederick was named Constantine by his mother.{{sfn|Kantorowicz|1937|p=8}}{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=62}}{{efn|There is some doubt of this because the sources are not exactly contemporary.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} The ''[[Annales Stadenses]]'' and ''[[Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis]]'' both record his birth name.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}}} This name, a masculine form of his mother's name, served to identify him closely with both his Norman heritage and his imperial heritage (through [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor).{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|pp=89\u201390}} It was still his name at the time of his election as [[King of the Romans]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}{{sfn|Kantorowicz|1937|p=11}} He was only given his grandfathers' names, becoming Frederick Roger (or Roger Frederick), at his baptism when he was two years old.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}}{{efn|His double name at baptism is recorded by [[Roger of Howden]] and the fact that the order was not important is made clear in the ''[[Annales Casinenses]]''.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|p=20}} Houben, however, believes that he was probably only baptized under the name Frederick.{{sfn|Houben|2002|p=174}}}} This dual name served the same purpose as Constantine: emphasising his dual heritage.{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nFrederick's birth was accompanied by gossip and rumour on account of his mother's advanced age. According to [[Albert of Stade]] and [[Salimbene]], he was not the son of Henry and Constance but was presented to Henry as his own after a faked pregnancy. His real father was variously described as a butcher of Jesi, a physician, a miller or a falconer. Frederick's birth was also associated with a prophecy of [[Merlin]]. According to [[Andrea Dandolo]], writing at some distance but probably recording contemporary gossip, Henry doubted reports of his wife's pregnancy and was only convinced by consulting [[Joachim of Fiore]], who confirmed that Frederick was his son by interpretation of Merlin's prophecy and the [[Erythraean Sibyl]]. A later legend claims that Constance gave birth in the public square of Jesi to silence doubters. None of these stories have any validity, although it is clear that Constance took unusual measures to prove her pregnancy and its legitimacy. [[Roger of Howden]] reports that she swore on the gospels before a [[papal legate]] that Frederick was her son and Henry's. It is probable that these public acts of affirmation on account of her age gave rise to some false rumours.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1972|pp=13\u201316}}\n\n==Early years==\nIn 1196 at [[Frankfurt am Main]] the infant Frederick was elected King of the Romans and thus heir to his father's imperial crown. His rights in Germany were [[German throne dispute|to end up disputed]] by Henry's brother [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]]. At the death of his father in 1197, Frederick was in Italy, traveling towards Germany, when the bad news reached his guardian, [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Spoleto]]. Frederick was hastily brought back to his mother Constance in Palermo, Sicily, where he was crowned king on 17 May 1198, at just three years of age.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nConstance of Sicily was in her own right queen of Sicily, and she established herself as [[regent]]. Upon Constance's death in 1198, [[Pope Innocent III]] succeeded as Frederick's guardian. Frederick's tutor during this period was [[Honorius III|Cencio]], who would become Pope Honorius III.<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1193.htm#Cencio FIU.edu]</ref> [[Markward von Annweiler|Markward of Annweiler]], with the support of Henry's brother, [[Philip of Swabia]], reclaimed the regency for himself and soon after invaded the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1200, with the help of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese ships]], he landed in Sicily and one year later seized the young Frederick.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} He thus ruled Sicily until 1202, when he was succeeded by another German captain, [[William of Capparone]], who kept Frederick under his control in the royal palace of Palermo until 1206. Frederick was subsequently under tutor [[Walter of Palearia]], until, in 1208, he was declared of age. His first task was to reassert his power over Sicily and southern Italy, where local barons and adventurers had usurped most of the authority.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Posse Band 1 b 0063.jpg|thumb|Seals used by Frederick as Emperor (ed.

In southern Italy, Otto became the champion of those noblemen and barons who feared Frederick's increasingly strong measures to check their power, such as the dismissal of the pro-noble Walter of Palearia. The new emperor invaded Italy, where he reached [[Calabria]] without meeting much resistance.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nIn response, Innocent sided against Otto, and in September 1211 at the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] Frederick was elected ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as German King by a rebellious faction backed by the pope. Innocent also excommunicated Otto, who was forced to return to Germany.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Frederick sailed to [[Gaeta]] with a small following. He agreed with the pope on a future separation between the Sicilian and Imperial titles, and named his wife Constance as regent. Passing through [[Lombardy]] and [[Engadin]], he reached [[Konstanz]] in September 1212, preceding Otto by a few hours.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nFrederick was crowned as king on 9 December 1212 in [[Mainz]]. Frederick's authority in Germany remained tenuous, and he was recognized only in southern Germany. In the region of northern Germany, the center of [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] power, Otto continued to hold the reins of royal and imperial power despite his excommunication. Otto's decisive military defeat at the [[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines]] forced him to withdraw to the Guelph hereditary lands where, virtually without supporters, he died in 1218.<ref name=\"Toch381\" />\n\nThe German princes, supported by Innocent III, again elected Frederick king of Germany in 1215, and he was crowned king in [[Aachen]] on 23 July 1215 by one of the three German archbishops. It was not until another five years had passed, and only after further negotiations between Frederick, Innocent III, and [[Pope Honorius III|Honorius III]] \u2013 who succeeded to the papacy after Innocent's death in 1216 \u2013 that Frederick was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Honorius III, on 22 November 1220.<ref name=\"Toch381\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welfs, Hohenstaufen and Habsburgs |first=Michael |last=Toch |encyclopedia=The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 1198 \u2013 c. 1300 |volume=5 |editor-first1=David |editor-last1=Abulafia |editor-first2=Rosamond |editor-last2=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=381}}</ref> At the same time, Frederick's oldest son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry]] took the title of King of the Romans.<ref name=\"Toch381\" />\n\nUnlike most Holy Roman emperors, Frederick spent few years in Germany. In 1218, he helped King [[Philip II of France]] and [[Odo III, Duke of Burgundy]], to bring an end to the [[War of Succession (Champagne)|War of Succession]] in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] (France) by invading [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], capturing and burning [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], capturing [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine]] and forcing him to withdraw his support from [[Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt]]. After his coronation in 1220, Frederick remained either in the Kingdom of Sicily or on [[Crusade]] until 1236, when he made his last journey to Germany. He returned to Italy in 1237 and stayed there for the remaining thirteen years of his life, represented in Germany by his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]].\n\nIn the Kingdom of Sicily, he built on the reform of the laws begun at the [[Assizes of Ariano]] in 1140 by his grandfather [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. His initiative in this direction was visible as early as the [[Assizes of Capua]] (1220, issued soon after his coronation in Rome) but came to fruition in his promulgation of the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] (1231, also known as ''[[Liber Augustalis]]''), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and was a source of inspiration for a long time after. It made the Kingdom of Sicily an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist monarchy]]; it also set a precedent for the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the ''Liber Augustalis'' remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819.\n\n==The Fifth Crusade and early policies in northern Italy==\n[[File:Augustale.jpg|thumb|left|An [[augustale]] coin of Frederick II, from the [[Messina]] mint of Sicily, struck some time after 1231]]\n\nAt the time he was elected King of the Romans, Frederick promised to go on [[Fifth Crusade|crusade]]. He continually delayed, however, and, in spite of his renewal of this vow at his coronation as the King of Germany, he did not travel to [[Egypt]] with the armies of the [[Fifth Crusade]] in 1217. He sent forces to Egypt under the command of [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria]], but constant expectation of his arrival caused papal legate [[Pelagio Galvani|Pelagius]] to reject [[Ayyubid]] sultan [[Al-Kamil]]'s offer to restore the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem to the crusaders in exchange for their withdrawal from Egypt and caused the Crusade to continually stall in anticipation of his ever-delayed arrival. The crusade ended in failure with the loss of [[Damietta]] in 1221.<ref>Madden, Thomas F. ''The New Concise History of the Crusades''.

Those assembled responded with the reformation of the [[Lombard League]], which had already defeated his grandfather [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in the 12th century, and again [[Milan]] was chosen as the league's leader. The Diet was cancelled, however, and the situation was stabilized only through a compromise reached by Honorius between Frederick and the league.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} During his sojourn in northern Italy, Frederick also invested the [[Teutonic Order]] with the territories in what would become [[East Prussia]], starting what was later called the [[Northern Crusade]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n==The Sixth Crusade==\n{{Main|Sixth Crusade}}\n[[File:Al-Kamil Muhammad al-Malik and Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor.jpg|thumb|Frederick II (left) meets [[Al-Kamil]] (right). ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'', c. 1348.]]\nProblems of stability within the empire delayed Frederick's departure on crusade. It was not until 1225, when, by proxy, Frederick had married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]], heiress to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], that his departure seemed assured. Frederick immediately saw to it that his new father-in-law [[John of Brienne]], the current king of Jerusalem, was dispossessed and his rights transferred to the emperor. In August 1227, Frederick set out for the Holy Land from [[Brindisi]] but was forced to return when he was struck down by an epidemic that had broken out. Even the master of the [[Teutonic Knights]], [[Hermann of Salza]], recommended that he return to the mainland to recuperate. On 29 September 1227, Frederick was excommunicated by [[Pope Gregory IX]] for failing to honor his crusading pledge.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nMany contemporary chroniclers doubted the sincerity of Frederick's illness, and their attitude may be explained by their pro-papal leanings. [[Roger of Wendover]], a chronicler of the time, wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=... he went to the Mediterranean sea, and embarked with a small retinue; but after pretending to make for the holy land for three days, he said that he was seized with a sudden illness... this conduct of the emperor redounded much to his disgrace, and to the injury of the whole business of the crusade.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Roger of Wendover|title= Christian Society and the Crusades|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/christiansociety0000pete|chapter-url-access=registration|editor= Peters|year=1971|location=Philadelphia|publisher= Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref>}}\n\nFrederick eventually sailed again from Brindisi in June 1228. The pope, still Gregory IX, regarded that action as a provocation, since, as an excommunicate, Frederick was technically not capable of conducting a Crusade, and he excommunicated the emperor a second time. Frederick reached [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in September. Many of the local nobility, the Templars, and Hospitallers were therefore reluctant to offer overt support. Since the crusading army was already a small force, Frederick negotiated along the lines of a previous agreement he had intended to broker with the [[Ayyubid]] sultan, [[Al-Kamil]]. The [[Treaty of Jaffa and Tell Ajul|treaty]], signed in February 1229, resulted in the [[restitution]] of Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], [[Bethlehem]], and a small coastal strip to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, though there are disagreements as to the extent of the territory returned.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\n[[File:Regensburg - Historisches Museum - Friedrich II..JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Frederick II from the Black Tower of [[Regensburg]], {{circa|1280\u20131290}}.]]\nThe treaty also stipulated that the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] were to remain under Muslim control and that the city of Jerusalem would remain without fortifications.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Virtually all other crusaders, including the Templars and Hospitallers, condemned this deal as a political ploy on the part of Frederick to regain his kingdom while betraying the cause of the Crusaders. Al-Kamil, who was nervous about possible war with his relatives who ruled [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]], wished to avoid further trouble from the Christians, at least until his domestic rivals were subdued.\n\nThe crusade ended in a truce and in Frederick's coronation as [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] on 18 March 1229, although this was technically improper. Frederick's wife Isabella, the heiress, had died, leaving their infant son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]] as rightful king. There is also disagreement as to whether the \"coronation\" was a coronation at all, as a letter written by Frederick to [[Henry III of England]] suggests that the crown he placed on his own head was in fact the imperial crown of the Romans.\n\nAt his coronation, he may have worn the red silk mantle that had been crafted during the reign of Roger II.{{cn|date=March 2019}} It bore an Arabic inscription indicating that the robe dated from the year 528 in the Muslim calendar, and incorporated a generic benediction, wishing its wearer \"vast prosperity, great generosity and high splendor, fame and magnificent endowments, and the fulfillment of his wishes and hopes. May his days and nights go in pleasure without end or change.\" This coronation robe can be found today in the ''Schatzkammer'' of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.\n\nIn any case, [[Gerald of Lausanne]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], did not attend the ceremony; indeed, the next day the [[Bishop of Caesarea]] arrived to place the city under interdict on the patriarch's orders. Frederick's further attempts to rule over the Kingdom of Jerusalem were met by resistance on the part of the barons, led by [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut]]. In the mid-1230s, Frederick's viceroy was forced to leave Acre, and in 1244, following a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1244)|siege]], Jerusalem itself was lost again to a new Muslim offensive.\n\nWhilst Frederick's seeming bloodless recovery of Jerusalem for the cross brought him great prestige in some European circles, his decision to complete the crusade while excommunicated provoked Church hostility. Although in 1230 the Pope lifted Frederick's excommunication at the [[Treaty of Ceprano (1230)|Treaty of Ceprano]], this decision was taken for a variety of reasons related to the political situation in Europe. Of Frederick's crusade, [[Philip of Novara]], a chronicler of the period, said, \"The emperor left Acre [after the conclusion of the truce]; hated, cursed, and vilified.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Peters |title=The History of Philip of Novara |encyclopedia=Christian Society and the Crusades |location=Philadelphia |year=1971}}</ref> Overall this crusade, arguably the first successful one since the [[First Crusade]], was adversely affected by the manner in which Frederick carried out negotiations without the support of the church. He left behind a kingdom in the Levant torn between his agents and the local nobility, a civil war known as the [[War of the Lombards]].\n\nThe itinerant [[Joachimite]] preachers and many radical [[Franciscan]]s, the [[Franciscan Spirituals|Spirituals]], supported Frederick. Against the interdict pronounced on his lands, the preachers condemned the Pope and continued to minister the sacraments and grant absolutions. Brother Arnold in [[Swabia]] proclaimed the [[Second Coming]] for 1260, at which time Frederick would then confiscate the riches of Rome and distribute them among the poor, the \"only true Christians.\"<ref>[[Marvin Harris]], ''Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches'', Chapter 10 <!-- pp. 196 and 197 out of 235 in my translated edition. --></ref>\n\n==The war against the Pope and Henry's revolt==\nDuring Frederick's stay in the Holy Land, his regent, Rainald of Spoleto, had attacked the [[Marche]] and the [[Duchy of Spoleto]]. Gregory IX recruited an army under [[John of Brienne]] and, in 1229, invaded southern Italy. His troops overcame an initial resistance at [[Montecassino]] and reached [[Apulia]]. Frederick arrived at Brindisi in June 1229. He quickly recovered the lost territories, and tried and condemned the rebel barons, but avoided crossing the borders of the Papal States.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} \n\nThe war came to an end with the [[Treaty of Ceprano (1230)|Treaty of Ceprano]] in the summer of 1230; the emperor personally met Gregory IX at [[Anagni]], making some concessions to the church in Sicily.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} He also issued the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] (August 1231), as an attempt to solve the political and administrative problems of the country, which had dramatically been shown by the recent war.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nWhile he may have temporarily made his peace with the pope, Frederick found the German princes another matter. Frederick's son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]] (who was born 1211 in Sicily, son of Frederick's first wife [[Constance of Aragon]]) had caused their discontent with an aggressive policy against their privileges. This forced Henry to a complete capitulation, and the ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' (\"Statutes in favor of the princes\"), issued at Worms, deprived the emperor of much of his sovereignty in Germany.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Frederick summoned Henry to a meeting, which was held at [[Aquileia]] in 1232. Henry confirmed his submission, but Frederick was nevertheless compelled to confirm the ''Statutum'' at [[Cividale]] soon afterwards.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nThe situation for Frederick was also problematic in Lombardy, after all the emperor's attempts to restore the imperial authority in Lombardy with the help of Gregory IX (at the time, ousted from Rome by a revolt) turned to nothing in 1233. In the meantime Henry in Germany had returned to an anti-princes policy, against his father's will: Frederick thus obtained his excommunication from Gregory IX (July 1234). Henry tried to muster an opposition in Germany and asked the Lombard cities to block the Alpine passes. In May 1235, Frederick went to Germany, taking no army with him: as soon as July, however, he was able to force his son to renounce to the crown all his lands, at Worms, and then imprisoned him.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nIn Germany the Hohenstaufen and the Guelphs reconciled in 1235. [[Otto the Child]], the grandson of [[Henry the Lion]], had been deposed as Duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1180, conveying the allodial Guelphic possessions to Frederick, who in return [[enfeoffed]] Otto with the same lands and additional former imperial possessions as the newly established Duke of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], ending the unclear status of the German Guelphs, who had been left without title and rank after 1180.\n\n==The war for Lombardy and Italy==\n[[File:Cortenuova1237.JPG|thumb|260px|right|The victorious [[Battle of Cortenuova]] against the [[Lombard League|2nd Lombard League]] (1237), ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).]]\n[[File:Federico II platba.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Frederick II's troops paid with leather coins during the sieges of [[Siege of Brescia|Brescia]] and [[siege of Faenza|Faenza]],<ref name=WIP>{{cite book|title=Medieval European Coinage: Vol. 14 |first=Philip |last=Gierson |year=1998 |place=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).]]\n\nWith peace north of the Alps, Frederick raised an army from the German princes to suppress the rebel cities in Lombardy. Gregory tried to stop the invasion with diplomatic moves, but in vain. During his descent to Italy, Frederick had to divert his troops to quell a rebellion of [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]]. At [[Vienna]], in February 1237, he obtained the title of [[King of the Romans]] for his 9-year-old son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]].{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nAfter the failure of the negotiations between the Lombard cities, the pope and the imperial diplomats, Frederick invaded Lombardy from [[Verona]]. In November 1237 he won the decisive [[Battle of Cortenuova|battle in Cortenuova]] over the Lombard League. Frederick celebrated it with a triumph in [[Cremona]] in the manner of an ancient [[Roman emperor]], with the captured ''[[carroccio]]'' (later sent to the commune of Rome) and an elephant. He rejected any suit for peace, even from [[Milan]], which had sent a great sum of money. This demand of total surrender spurred further resistance from Milan, [[Brescia]], [[Bologna]], and [[Piacenza]], and in October 1238 he was forced to raise the [[siege of Brescia]], in the course of which his enemies had tried unsuccessfully to capture him.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}}\n\nFrederick received the news of his excommunication by Gregory IX in the first months of 1239<ref name=\"bressler\">{{cite book | last = Bressler | first = Richard | title = Frederick II : the wonder of the world | publisher = Westholme | location = Yardley, Pennsylvania | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781594161094 }}</ref>{{rp|149}} while his court was in [[Padua]]<ref>Busk, pp. 455-458.</ref> The emperor responded by expelling the [[Minorite|Franciscans]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] from Lombardy and electing his son [[Enzo of Sardinia|Enzo]] as Imperial vicar for Northern Italy.<ref name=\"csun\">{{Cite web|title=Sede Vacante 1241\u20131243 |last=Adams |first=John P |work=csun.edu |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2014 |url= http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1241-b.html}}</ref> Enzo soon annexed the [[Romagna]], [[March of Ancona|Marche]], and the [[Duchy of Spoleto]], nominally part of the [[Papal States]].

In January 1240, Frederick triumphantly entered [[Foligno]] followed by [[Viterbo]], whence he aimed to finally conquer Rome to restore the ancient splendours of the Empire. Frederick's plan to attack Rome at that time, however, did not come to fruition as he chose to leave for southern Italy where a papal incited rebellion flared in Apulia. In southern Italy, Frederick attacked and razed [[Citt\u00e0 Sant'Angelo|St Angelo]] and [[Benevento]].<ref>Busk, pp. 8-11.</ref>\n\n[[File:ChronicaMajora-Giglio1241-MatthewParis-HenryIII(1259).PNG|thumb|right|320px|[[Battle of Giglio (1241)|Battle of Giglio]], against [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] (1241), miniature in ''[[Chronica Maiora]]'' (1259).]]\n\nIn the meantime the [[Ghibelline]] city of [[Ferrara]] had fallen, and Frederick swept his way northwards capturing [[Ravenna]] and, after [[Siege of Faenza|another long siege]], [[Faenza]]. The people of [[Forl\u00ec]], which had kept its Ghibelline stance even after the collapse of [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] power, offered their loyal support during the capture of the rival city: as a sign of gratitude, they were granted an augmentation of the communal coat-of-arms with the Hohenstaufen eagle, together with other privileges.

He was a member of a noble Imperial family and had some relatives in Frederick's camp, so the Emperor was initially happy with his election. Innocent, however, was to become his fiercest enemy. Negotiations began in the summer of 1243, but the situation changed as [[Viterbo]] rebelled, instigated by the intriguing local cardinal [[Ranieri Capocci]]. Frederick could not afford to lose his main stronghold near Rome, so he [[Siege of Viterbo|besieged the city]].{{sfn|Kamp|1975}}\n\nInnocent convinced the rebels to sign a peace but, after Frederick withdrew his garrison, Ranieri had them slaughtered on 13 November. Frederick was enraged. The new Pope was a master diplomat, and Frederick signed a peace treaty, which was soon broken. Innocent showed his true Guelph face, and, together with most of the Cardinals, fled via Genoese galleys to [[Liguria]], arriving on 7 July. His aim was to reach [[Lyon]], where a new council was being held since 24 June 1245.{{sfn|Kamp|1975}}\n\nDespite initially appearing that the council could end with a compromise, the intervention of Ranieri, who had a series of insulting pamphlets published against Frederick (in which, among other things, he defined the emperor as a heretic and an Antichrist), led the prelates towards a less accommodating solution.{{sfn|Kamp|1975}} One month later, Innocent IV declared Frederick to be deposed as emperor, characterising him as a \"friend of Babylon's sultan,\" \"of Saracen customs,\" \"provided with a harem guarded by [[eunuchs]],\" like the schismatic emperor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], and in sum a \"heretic.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120510045457/http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum13.htm#Bull#Bull Papal bull of excommunication of Frederick II]</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick-ii-excommunicated-by-pope-innocent-iv1.jpg|left|thumb|Frederick II being excommunicated by [[Pope Innocent IV]]]]\n\nThe Pope backed [[Heinrich Raspe]], [[landgrave of Thuringia]], as rival for the imperial crown and set in motion a plot to kill Frederick and Enzo, with the support of the pope's brother-in-law Orlando de Rossi, another friend of Frederick. The plotters were unmasked by the count of [[Caserta]], however, and the city of [[Altavilla Silentina|Altavilla]], where they had found shelter, was razed. The guilty were blinded, mutilated, and burnt alive or hanged. An attempt to invade the Kingdom of Sicily, under the command of Ranieri, was halted at [[Spello]] by Marino of Eboli, Imperial vicar of Spoleto.\n\nInnocent also sent a flow of money to Germany to cut off Frederick's power at its source. The [[archbishops of Cologne]] and [[archbishop of Mainz|Mainz]] also declared Frederick deposed, and in May 1246 Heinrich Raspe was chosen as the new king. On 5 August 1246 Heinrich, thanks to the Pope's money, managed to defeat an army of Conrad, son of Frederick, near [[Frankfurt]]. Frederick strengthened his position in Southern Germany, however, acquiring the [[Duchy of Austria]], whose duke had died without heirs. A year later Heinrich died, and the new [[anti-king]] was [[William II of Holland]].\n\nBetween February and March 1247 Frederick settled the situation in Italy by means of the diet of [[Terni]], naming his relatives or friends as vicars of the various lands. He married his son Manfred to the daughter of [[Amadeus IV of Savoy|Amedeo di Savoia]] and secured the submission of the marquis of [[Monferrato]]. On his part, Innocent asked protection from the King of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], but the king was a friend of the Emperor and believed in his desire for peace. A papal army under the command of [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]] never reached Lombardy, and the Emperor, accompanied by a massive army, held the next diet in [[Turin]].\n\n==Battle of Parma==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | footer = \n | image1 = Federico II Parma.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The unexpected sally of the Guelph cavalry from Parma against Vittoria{{cn|date=March 2019}}<!--Nuova Cronica??-->\n | image2 = Enzo Codice Chigi.JPG\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = [[Battle of Fossalta]] against the [[Lombard League|2nd Lombard League]] (1249), ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (c. 1348).\n }}\n\nAn unexpected event was to change the situation dramatically. In June 1247 the important Lombard city of Parma expelled the Imperial functionaries and sided with the Guelphs. Enzo was not in the city and could do nothing more than ask for help from his father, who came back to lay siege to the rebels, together with his friend [[Ezzelino III da Romano]], tyrant of [[Verona]]. The besieged languished as the Emperor waited for them to surrender from starvation. He had a wooden city, which he called \"Vittoria\", built around the walls.\n\nOn 18 February 1248, during one of these absences, the camp was suddenly assaulted and taken, and in the ensuing [[Battle of Parma]] the Imperial side was routed. Frederick lost the Imperial treasure and with it any hope of maintaining the impetus of his struggle against the rebellious communes and against the pope, who began plans for a crusade against Sicily. Frederick soon recovered and rebuilt an army, but this defeat encouraged resistance in many cities that could no longer bear the fiscal burden of his regime: Romagna, Marche and Spoleto were lost.\n\nIn February 1249 Frederick fired his advisor and prime minister, the famous jurist and poet [[Pier delle Vigne]], on charges of peculation and [[embezzlement]]. Some historians suggest that Pier was planning to betray the Emperor, who, according to [[Matthew of Paris]], cried when he discovered the plot. Pier, blinded and in chains, died in Pisa, possibly by his own hand. Even more shocking for Frederick was the capture of his natural son [[Enzo of Sardinia]] by the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] at the [[Battle of Fossalta]], in May 1249. Enzo was held in a palace in Bologna, where he remained captive until his death in 1272.\n\nFrederick lost another son, Richard of [[Chieti]]. The struggle continued: the Empire lost [[Como]] and [[Modena]], but regained [[Ravenna]]. An army sent to invade the Kingdom of Sicily under the command of Cardinal Pietro Capocci was crushed in the Marche at the [[Battle of Cingoli]] in 1250. In the first month of that year the indomitable Ranieri of Viterbo died and the Imperial ''condottieri'' again reconquered Romagna, the Marche and Spoleto; and [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad, King of the Romans]], scored several victories in Germany against William of Holland.\n\n[[File:Tomb of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor - Cathedral of Palermo - Italy 2015.jpg|thumb|left|155px|The sarcophagus of Frederick II in the [[Cathedral of Palermo]]]]\n\nFrederick did not take part in of any of these campaigns. He had been ill and likely felt tired. Despite the betrayals and the setbacks he had faced in his last years, Frederick died peacefully, wearing the habit of a [[Cistercian]] monk, on 13 December 1250 in [[Castel Fiorentino]] (territory of [[Torremaggiore]]), in [[Apulia]], after an attack of [[dysentery]].\n\nAt the time of his death, his preeminent position in Europe was challenged but not lost: his testament left his legitimate son Conrad the Imperial and Sicilian crowns. Manfred received the principality of [[Taranto]] and the government of the Kingdom, Henry the [[Kingdom of Arles]] or that of [[Jerusalem]], while the son of [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]] was entrusted with the Duchy of Austria and the [[March of Styria]]. Frederick's will stipulated that all the lands he had taken from the Church were to be returned to it, all the prisoners freed, and the taxes reduced, provided this did not damage the Empire's prestige.\n\nHowever, upon Conrad's death a mere four years later, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell from power and the [[Holy Roman Empire#Interregnum|Great Interregnum]] began, lasting until 1273, one year after the last Hohenstaufen, Enzo, had died in his prison. During this time, a legend developed that Frederick was [[King asleep in mountain|not truly dead but merely sleeping]] in the [[Kyffh\u00e4user]] Mountains and would one day awaken to reestablish his empire. Over time, this legend largely transferred itself to his grandfather, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also known as ''Barbarossa'' (\"Redbeard\").<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Medieval Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmedieva0000davi|url-access=registration|author=Ralph Henry Carless Davis, Robert Ian Moore|year=1957}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2014}}\n\nHis [[sarcophagus]] (made of red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]) lies in the [[cathedral of Palermo]] beside those of his parents (Henry VI and Constance) as well as his grandfather, the [[Normans|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily]].

Lansing and English, two British historians, argue that medieval Palermo has been overlooked in favor of Paris and London:\n{{bquote|One effect of this approach has been to privilege historical winners, [and] aspects of medieval Europe that became important in later centuries, above all the nation state.... Arguably the liveliest cultural innovation in the 13th century was Mediterranean, centered on Frederick II's polyglot court and administration in Palermo.... Sicily and the Italian South in later centuries suffered a long slide into overtaxed poverty and marginality. Textbook narratives therefore focus not on medieval Palermo, with its Muslim and Jewish bureaucracies and Arabic-speaking monarch, but on the historical winners, Paris and London.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carol Lansing and Edward D.

They argue that Frederick understood himself as a Christian monarch in the sense of a [[Byzantine emperor]], thus as God's \"[[viceroy]]\" on earth.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} Whatever his personal feelings toward religion, certainly submission to the pope did not enter into the matter in the slightest. This was in line with the Hohenstaufen ''Kaiser-Idee'', the ideology claiming the Holy Roman Emperor to be the legitimate successor to the [[Roman Empire|Roman Emperors]].\n\n[[File:StrasbourgCath BasCoteN 04a.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Stained glass]] windows from the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], [[Alsace]], [[Bas-Rhin]], France, dated circa 1210\u20131270, depicting [[emperors of the Holy Roman Empire]]: [[Philip of Swabia]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], and Frederick II]]\n\n20th-century treatments of Frederick vary from the sober (Wolfgang St\u00fcrner) to the dramatic ([[Ernst Kantorowicz]]).{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} However, all agree on Frederick II's significance as Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Kamp|1995}} In the judgment of British historian Geoffrey Barraclough, Frederick's extensive concessions to German princes{{snd}}which he made in the hopes of securing his base for his Italian projects{{snd}}undid the political power of his predecessors and postponed German unity for centuries.\n\nHowever, the modern approach to Frederick II tends to be focused on the continuity between Frederick and his predecessors as Kings of Sicily and Holy Roman Emperors, and the similarities between him and other thirteenth-century monarchs. David Abulafia, in a biography subtitled \"A Medieval Emperor,\" argues that Frederick's reputation as an enlightened figure ahead of his time is undeserved, and that Frederick was mostly a conventionally Christian monarch who sought to rule in a conventional medieval manner.{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=436}}\n\n==Family==\nFrederick left numerous children, legitimate and illegitimate:\n\n===Legitimate issue===\n* First wife: [[Constance of Aragon, Holy Roman Empress|Constance of Aragon]] (1179 \u2013 23 June 1222).<ref name=\"Runciman26\">Steven Runciman, ''The Sicilian Vespers'', (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 26.</ref> Marriage: 15 August 1209, at [[Messina]], Sicily.\n** [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry (VII)]] (1211 \u2013 12 February 1242).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" />\n* Second wife: [[Yolande of Jerusalem]] (1212 \u2013 25 April 1228).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" /> Marriage: 9 November 1225, at [[Brindisi]], Apulia.\n** Margareta (November 1226 \u2013 August 1227).\n** [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (25 April 1228 \u2013 21 May 1254).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" />\n* Third wife: [[Isabella of England]] (1214 \u2013 1 December 1241).<ref name=\"Runciman26\" /> Marriage: 15 July 1235, at Worms, Germany.\n** Jordan (born during the Spring of 1236, failed to survive the year);<ref>Thomas Curtis Van Cleve's ''The Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen: Immutator Mundi'' (Oxford, 1972). p. 381: \"Certainly there is some evidence that a son, Jordanus, was born in the year 1236, and died shortly afterwards, but the only son of Frederick II and Isabella of England whose birth can be firmly established was a second Henry, born in 1238, and named after his uncle, Henry III, the King of England.\"</ref> this child was given the baptismal name Jordanus as he was baptized with water brought for that purpose from the Jordan river.\n** Agnes (b and d. 1237).\n** Henry (18 February 1238 \u2013 May 1253), named after [[Henry III of England]], his uncle; appointed Governor of Sicily and promised to become [[List of kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] after his father died, but he, too, died within three years and was never crowned.
