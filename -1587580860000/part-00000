This means that building a new configuration cannot overwrite previous configurations.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190706084138/http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/hotos-final.pdf |first1=Eelco |last1=Dolstra |first2=Armijn |last2=Hemel |title=Purely Functional System Configuration Management |date=2007}}</ref>\n\nA NixOS system is configured by writing a specification of the functionality that the user wants on their machine in a global configuration file. For instance, here is a minimal configuration of a machine running an SSH daemon:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nixos.org/nixos/about.html |title=About NixOS|publisher=Nixos.org|accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"nix\">\n{\n  boot.loader.grub.device = \"/dev/sda\";\n  fileSystems.\"/\".device = \"/dev/sda1\";\n  services.sshd.enable = true;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAfter changing the configuration file, the system can be updated using the <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> command. This command does everything necessary to apply the new configuration, including downloading and compiling packages and generating configuration files.\n\n=== Reliable upgrades ===\nSince Nix files are [[Purely functional programming|pure]] and [[Declarative programming|declarative]], evaluating them will always produce the same result, regardless of what packages or configuration files are on the system. Thus, upgrading a system is as reliable as reinstalling from scratch.\n\n=== Atomic upgrades ===\nNixOS has a transactional approach to configuration management making configuration changes such as upgrades [[Atomic operation|atomic]]. This means that if the upgrade to a new configuration is interrupted \u2013 say, the power fails half-way through \u2013 the system will still be in a consistent state: it will either boot in the old or the new configuration. In other systems, a machine might end up in an inconsistent state, and may not even boot anymore.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115184012/https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/atomic-hotswup2008-final.pdf |title=Atomic Upgrading of Distributed Systems |first1=Sander |last1=van der Burg |first2=Eelco |last2=Dolstra |first3=Merijn |last3=de Jonge |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Rollbacks ===\nIf after a system update the new configuration is undesirable, it can be rolled back using a special command (<code>nixos-rebuild switch --rollback</code>).  Every system configuration version automatically shows up at the system boot menu. If the new configuration crashes or does not boot properly, an older version can be selected. Rollbacks are lightweight operations that do not involve files being restored from copies.\n\n=== Reproducible system configurations ===\nNixOS's declarative configuration model makes it easy to reproduce a system configuration on another machine. Copying the configuration file to the target machine and running the system update command generates the same system configuration (kernel, applications, system services, and so on) except for parts of the system not managed by the package manager such as user data.\n\n=== Source-based model, with binaries ===\nThe Nix build language used by NixOS specifies how to build packages from source. This makes it easy to adapt the system to user needs. However, building from source being a slow process, the package manager automatically downloads pre-built binaries from a cache server when they are available. This gives the flexibility of a source-based package management model with the efficiency of a binary model.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926081048/https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/secsharing-ase2005-final.pdf |title=Secure Sharing Between Untrusted Users in a Transparent Source/Binary Deployment Model |first=Eelco |last=Dolstra |date=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Consistency ===\nThe Nix package manager ensures that the running system is consistent with the logical specification of the system, meaning that it will rebuild all packages that need to be rebuilt. For instance, if the kernel is changed then the package manager will ensure that external kernel modules will be rebuilt. Similarly, when a library is updated it ensures that all the system packages use the new version, even packages statically linked to it.\n\n=== Multi-user package management ===\nThere is no need for special privileges to install software in NixOS. In addition to the system-wide profile, every user has a dedicated profile in which they can install packages. Nix also allows multiple versions of a package to coexist, so different users can have different versions of the same package installed in their respective profiles. If two users install the same version of a package, only one copy will be built or downloaded, and Nix's security model ensures that this is secure.\n\n== Implementation ==\nNixOS is based on the Nix package manager that stores all packages in isolation from each other in the package store.\n\nInstalled packages are identified by a cryptographic hash of all input used for their build. Changing the build instructions of a package modifies its hash and that will result in a different package installed in the package store. This system is also used to manage configuration files ensuring that newer configurations are not overwriting older ones.\n\nAn implication of this is that NixOS doesn't follow the [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]].  The only exceptions are a symlink <kbd>/bin/sh</kbd> to the version of [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] in the Nix store (like this: <code>/nix/store/s/5rnfzla9kcx4mj5zdc7nlnv8na1najvg-bash-4.3.43/</code>); and while NixOS does have an <kbd>/etc</kbd> directory to keep system-wide configuration files, most files in that directory are symlinks to generated files in <kbd>/nix/store</kbd> such as <code>/nix/store/s2sjbl85xnrc18rl4fhn56irkxqxyk4p-sshd_config</code>. Not using global directories such as <kbd>/bin</kbd> is part of what allows multiple versions of a package to coexist.\n\n== Reception ==\nJesse Smith reviewed NixOS 15.09 for DistroWatch Weekly.<ref>[https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20151123#nixos DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 637, 23 November 2015]</ref> Smith wrote:\n{{quote|I very much like the way NixOS takes the worry out of upgrading packages by placing each change in its own \"generation\" and I found, from the end user's point of view, NixOS worked just the same as any other Linux distribution.

For instance, here is a minimal configuration of a machine running an SSH daemon:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nixos.org/nixos/about.html |title=About NixOS|publisher=Nixos.org|accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"nix\">\n{\n  boot.loader.grub.device = \"/dev/sda\";\n  fileSystems.\"/\".device = \"/dev/sda1\";\n  services.sshd.enable = true;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAfter changing the configuration file, the system can be updated using the <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> command. This command does everything necessary to apply the new configuration, including downloading and compiling packages and generating configuration files.\n\n=== Reliable upgrades ===\nSince Nix files are [[Purely functional programming|pure]] and [[Declarative programming|declarative]], evaluating them will always produce the same result, regardless of what packages or configuration files are on the system. Thus, upgrading a system is as reliable as reinstalling from scratch.\n\n=== Atomic upgrades ===\nNixOS has a transactional approach to configuration management making configuration changes such as upgrades [[Atomic operation|atomic]]. This means that if the upgrade to a new configuration is interrupted \u2013 say, the power fails half-way through \u2013 the system will still be in a consistent state: it will either boot in the old or the new configuration. In other systems, a machine might end up in an inconsistent state, and may not even boot anymore.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115184012/https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/atomic-hotswup2008-final.pdf |title=Atomic Upgrading of Distributed Systems |first1=Sander |last1=van der Burg |first2=Eelco |last2=Dolstra |first3=Merijn |last3=de Jonge |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Rollbacks ===\nIf after a system update the new configuration is undesirable, it can be rolled back using a special command (<code>nixos-rebuild switch --rollback</code>).  Every system configuration version automatically shows up at the system boot menu. If the new configuration crashes or does not boot properly, an older version can be selected. Rollbacks are lightweight operations that do not involve files being restored from copies.\n\n=== Reproducible system configurations ===\nNixOS's declarative configuration model makes it easy to reproduce a system configuration on another machine. Copying the configuration file to the target machine and running the system update command generates the same system configuration (kernel, applications, system services, and so on) except for parts of the system not managed by the package manager such as user data.\n\n=== Source-based model, with binaries ===\nThe Nix build language used by NixOS specifies how to build packages from source. This makes it easy to adapt the system to user needs. However, building from source being a slow process, the package manager automatically downloads pre-built binaries from a cache server when they are available. This gives the flexibility of a source-based package management model with the efficiency of a binary model.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926081048/https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/secsharing-ase2005-final.pdf |title=Secure Sharing Between Untrusted Users in a Transparent Source/Binary Deployment Model |first=Eelco |last=Dolstra |date=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Consistency ===\nThe Nix package manager ensures that the running system is consistent with the logical specification of the system, meaning that it will rebuild all packages that need to be rebuilt. For instance, if the kernel is changed then the package manager will ensure that external kernel modules will be rebuilt. Similarly, when a library is updated it ensures that all the system packages use the new version, even packages statically linked to it.\n\n=== Multi-user package management ===\nThere is no need for special privileges to install software in NixOS. In addition to the system-wide profile, every user has a dedicated profile in which they can install packages. Nix also allows multiple versions of a package to coexist, so different users can have different versions of the same package installed in their respective profiles. If two users install the same version of a package, only one copy will be built or downloaded, and Nix's security model ensures that this is secure.\n\n== Implementation ==\nNixOS is based on the Nix package manager that stores all packages in isolation from each other in the package store.\n\nInstalled packages are identified by a cryptographic hash of all input used for their build. Changing the build instructions of a package modifies its hash and that will result in a different package installed in the package store. This system is also used to manage configuration files ensuring that newer configurations are not overwriting older ones.\n\nAn implication of this is that NixOS doesn't follow the [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]].  The only exceptions are a symlink <kbd>/bin/sh</kbd> to the version of [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] in the Nix store (like this: <code>/nix/store/s/5rnfzla9kcx4mj5zdc7nlnv8na1najvg-bash-4.3.43/</code>); and while NixOS does have an <kbd>/etc</kbd> directory to keep system-wide configuration files, most files in that directory are symlinks to generated files in <kbd>/nix/store</kbd> such as <code>/nix/store/s2sjbl85xnrc18rl4fhn56irkxqxyk4p-sshd_config</code>. Not using global directories such as <kbd>/bin</kbd> is part of what allows multiple versions of a package to coexist.\n\n== Reception ==\nJesse Smith reviewed NixOS 15.09 for DistroWatch Weekly.<ref>[https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20151123#nixos DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 637, 23 November 2015]</ref> Smith wrote:\n{{quote|I very much like the way NixOS takes the worry out of upgrading packages by placing each change in its own \"generation\" and I found, from the end user's point of view, NixOS worked just the same as any other Linux distribution.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft.

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\".

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft.

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\".

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat.

Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an ''intragroup'' context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between \u201cme\u201d and \u201cothers in the group\u201d) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.\n\nThe self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous.<ref name=\" Haslam, et al.

They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative ''ingroup'' homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of [[minority group]]s would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.<ref name=\"Simon & Brown (1987).\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Bernd | last2 = Brown | first2 = Rupert | year = 1987 | title = Perceived intragroup homogeneity in minority-majority contexts | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 703\u2013711 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.703}}</ref>\n\nWithin the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members.

The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.<ref name=\"Rubin2004\" /> The implications of this effect on [[stereotyping]] have been noted.<ref name=\"Rubin & Badea (2007)\">{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Mark|last2=Badea|first2=Constantina|date=2007|title=Why Do People Perceive Ingroup Homogeneity on Ingroup Traits and Outgroup Homogeneity on Outgroup Traits?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=33|issue=1|pages=31\u201342|doi=10.1177/0146167206293190|pmid=17178928}}</ref> \n\n==Empirical support==\nAn example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.<ref name=\"Park & Rothbart (1982).\">{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Bernadette | last2 = Rothbart | first2 = Myron | year = 1982 | title = Perception of out-group homogeneity and level of social categorization | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1051\u20131068 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.6.1051}}</ref>\n\n===Racial investigation===\n{{Main|Cross-race effect}}\n\nIn an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.<ref name=\"Chance & Goldstein (1981).\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chance | first1 = June| last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Alvin | year = 1981 | title = Depth of processing in response to own and other race faces | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 475\u2013480 | doi=10.1177/014616728173017}}</ref>\n\n==Explanations==\nThis bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Linville|first=Patricia W.|last2=Fischer |first2=Gregory W.|last3=Salovey|first3=Peter|title=Perceived distributions of the characteristics of in-group and out-group members: Empirical evidence and a computer simulation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989 | volume=57| issue=2| pages=165\u2013188| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.165|pmid=2760805}}</ref> but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as \"men\" and \"women\" who obviously interact frequently.<ref name=Rubin2004/>\n\nElsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Bernadette|last2=Judd |first2=Charles M.|title=Measures and models of perceived group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1990|volume=59|issue=2|pages=173\u2013191|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.173}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Thomas M.|last2=Carpenter |first2=Sandra L. |last3=Sedikides |first3=Constantine| last4=Li|first4=Fan|title=Differential processing of in-group and outgroup information.| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| date=1993| volume=64| issue=1| pages=21\u201334| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.21}}</ref>  However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous.  Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Lee| first=Yueh-Ting| last2=Ottati | first2=Victor| title=Determinants of ingroup and outgroup perceptions of heterogeneity: An investigation of Sino-American stereotypes.| journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology| date=1993| volume=24| issue=3| pages=298\u2013318| doi=10.1177/0022022193243003}}</ref>  Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.<ref name=\"De Cremer 138\u2013146\">{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title=    Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138\u2013146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}</ref>\n\n===Self-categorization theory ===\n\n[[Self-categorization theory]] attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups.<ref name=\"Haslam et al. (1996).\"/><ref name=\"McGarty, C (1999).\">{{cite book |last=McGarty |first=C. |year=1999 |title=Categorization in social psychology |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi |isbn=0-7619-5953-X }}</ref> For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an ''intragroup'' context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between \u201cme\u201d and \u201cothers in the group\u201d) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.\n\nThe self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous.<ref name=\" Haslam, et al. (1995).\">{{cite journal |last=Haslam |first=S. A. |last2=Oakes |first2=P. J. |last3=Turner |first3=J.

(1996).\"/> The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].<ref name=\"McGarty, C (1999).\"/>\n\n===Social identity theory ===\n\nAnother body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of [[social identity theory]].<ref name=\"Haslam et al. (1996).\"/> While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative ''ingroup'' homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of [[minority group]]s would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.<ref name=\"Simon & Brown (1987).\">{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Bernd | last2 = Brown | first2 = Rupert | year = 1987 | title = Perceived intragroup homogeneity in minority-majority contexts | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 703\u2013711 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.703}}</ref>\n\nWithin the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members. This too was empirically supported.<ref name=\"Simon (1992).\">{{cite journal | pages = 1\u201330 |doi=10.1080/14792779243000005|title=The Perception of Ingroup and Outgroup Homogeneity: Reintroducing the Intergroup Context|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|volume=3|year=1992|last1=Simon|first1=Bernd}}</ref> Recent research also has reaffirmed that this effect of in-group homogeneity on in-group defining dimensions and out-group homogeneity on out-group defining dimensions may occur because people use their ratings of perceived group variability to express the extent to which social groups possess specific characteristics.<ref name=\"Rubin & Badea (2007)\"/> Like the self-categorization theory account, this recent research also suggests that the effect may occur ''independent'' of the motivational concerns described in social identity theory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = The central tendency of a social group can affect ratings of its intragroup variability in the absence of social identity concerns | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 410\u2013415 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2010.01.001 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n*[[Common ingroup identity]]\n* [[Cross-race effect]]\n* [[Discrimination]]\n* [[Group attribution error]]\n* [[Group-serving bias]]\n* [[In-group favoritism]]\n* [[List of biases in judgment and decision making]]\n* [[Trait ascription bias]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Mullen|first1=Brian|last2=Hu|first2=Li-Tze|title=Perceptions of Ingroup and Outgroup Variability: A Meta-Analytic Integration|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=10|issue=3|year=1989|pages=233\u2013252|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1003_3}}\n*{{cite book |last=Quattrone |first=G.

Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\n*In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners is not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw is also held to determine which semi-final winner is designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue).<section end=Format />\n\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city are not scheduled to play at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Manchester United's UEFA Champions League home leg vs Barcelona has been reversed |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-champions-league-draw-15972728 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=15 March 2019 |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref> To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams are drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season is reversed from the original draw.<ref>{{cite web |title=Champions League quarter-final and semi-final draws: all you need to know |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2589810.html |work=UEFA |date=13 March 2019 |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Schedule==\nThe schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in [[Nyon]], Switzerland).<ref name=\"calendar\"/>\n\nFollowing the first set of round of 16 second leg matches, the competition was postponed indefinitely due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]].<ref name=\"week postponed\">{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=2641054.html |title=All of this week's UEFA matches postponed |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=15 March 2020 |access-date=15 March 2020|quote=due to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe and related decisions made by different governments, all UEFA club competitions matches scheduled this week are postponed  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408084832/https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=2641054.html |archivedate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"suspended\">{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2641071.html |title=UEFA postpones EURO 2020 by 12 months |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=17 March 2020 |access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref> The final, originally scheduled to take place on 30 May 2020, was officially postponed on 23 March 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2641114.html |title=UEFA Club Finals postponed |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=23 March 2020 |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> A working group was set up by UEFA to decide the calendar of the remainder of the season.<ref name=\"working group\">{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=2641077.html |title=Resolution of the European football family on a coordinated response to the impact of the COVID-19 on competitions |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=17 March 2020 |access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Round\n!Draw date\n!First leg\n!Second leg\n|-\n|Round of 16\n|16 December 2019, 12:00\n|18\u201319 & 25\u201326 February 2020\n|10\u201311 March & TBD 2020{{efn|Second week of matches originally scheduled for 17\u201318 March 2020}}\n|-\n|Quarter-finals{{efn|Quarter-final first legs originally scheduled for 7\u20138 April, and second legs 14\u201315 April 2020}}\n|rowspan=\"3\"|TBD{{efn|Quarter-final, semi-final and final draws originally scheduled for 20 March 2020, 12:00}}\n|TBD\n|TBD\n|-\n|Semi-finals{{efn|Semi-final first legs originally scheduled for 28\u201329 April, and second legs 5\u20136 May 2020}}\n|TBD\n|TBD\n|-\n|Final\n|colspan=\"2\"|TBD at [[Atat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium]], [[Istanbul]]{{efn|Final originally scheduled for 30 May 2020}}\n|}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Round of 16==\n<section begin=R16 />\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 16 December 2019, 12:00 [[Central European Time|CET]].<ref name=\"R16_draw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/draws/2020/2001141/ |title=UEFA Champions League round of 16 draw |publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref><section end=R16 />\n\n===Summary===\n<section begin=R16 />\nThe first legs were played as scheduled on 18, 19, 25 and 26 February, as were the first set of second legs on 10 and 11 March 2020.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg.

However, someone at Cartoon Network passed the pitch along to [[Adult Swim]], around the same time that Seth MacFarlane told Seth Green and Matthew Senreich to pitch the show to Adult Swim.\n\nThe show mocks popular culture, referencing [[toy]]s, [[Film|movie]]s, [[television]], [[game]]s, popular fads, and more obscure references like anime cartoons and older television programs, much in the same vein as comedy sketch shows like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"askmeninterview\">{{cite web | url=http://ie.askmen.com/celebs/interview_300/328_seth-green-interview.html| title= Seth Green Interview | publisher= askmen.com| accessdate= 2013-05-02}}</ref> It employs [[stop motion]] animation of [[toy]]s, [[action figure]]s, [[Clay animation|claymation]], and various other objects, such as tongue depressors, [[The Game of Life]] pegs, and popsicle sticks.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/episodes/3902/Robot_Chicken_Constantine_Dark_Tip.html |title=Video Games, Game Reviews & News |publisher=G4tv.com |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref>\n\nOne particular motif involves the idea of fantastical characters being placed in a more realistic world or situation (such as [[Stretch Armstrong]] requiring a corn syrup transplant after losing his abilities because of aging, [[Optimus Prime]] performing a prostate cancer [[Public service announcement|PSA]] for the humans, and [[Godzilla]] having problems in the bedroom).<ref name=\"askmeninterview\"/> The program aired a 30-minute episode dedicated to ''[[Star Wars]]'' which premiered June 17, 2007, in the US, featuring the voices of ''Star Wars'' notables [[George Lucas]], [[Mark Hamill]] (from a [[List of Robot Chicken episodes#6|previous episode]]), [[Billy Dee Williams]], and [[Ahmed Best]].<ref name=usa>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-06-12-robot-chicken_N.htm|title='Robot Chicken' digs its satirical talons into 'Star Wars'|accessdate=2008-11-02|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Mike Snider|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref> The ''Star Wars'' episode was nominated for a 2008 [[Emmy]] Award as Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour).\n\nThe show airs in the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s [[Adult Swim UK|Adult Swim]] block, in Canada on [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]]'s [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)#The Detour on Teletoon and F-Night|TELETOON at Night]] block, in [[Australia]] on [[The Comedy Channel]]'s Adult Swim block, in Russia on 2x2's Adult Swim block, in Germany on TNT Series' Adult Swim block, and in [[Latin America]] on the [[I.Sat]] Adult Swim block (after the Adult Swim block was canceled from [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]] Latin America in 2008).

Midway through the opening sequence, the titular chicken turns his laser eye towards the camera, and the title appears amidst the \"laser effects\" as [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] can be heard screaming \"It's alive!\" \u00e0 la ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. Claypool also composed and performed the show's theme song. The mad scientist then straps the re-animated Robot Chicken into a chair, uses [[calipers]] to hold his eyes open, and forces him to watch a bank of television monitors (with allusions to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''); this scene [[segue]]s into the body of the show, which resembles someone frequently changing TV channels.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn the episode \"1987\", [[Michael Ian Black]] claims in the \"Best Robot Chicken Ever\" sketch that this sequence tells the viewers that they are the chicken, being forced to watch the skits. As a result, the show does not actually focus on the Robot Chicken until the 100th episode, when he finally makes his escape and later kills the mad scientist when he takes his hen girlfriend Cluckerella.\n\nBeginning in the sixth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with a role reversal (after the events of the show's 100th episode). The Robot Chicken comes upon the body of the scientist, which has been decapitated. He decides to do to the scientist what the mad scientist did to him: add robotic parts to him, turn him into a cyborg, and give him a laser eye (although he gives the scientist a blue eye instead of a red one, which necessitates a change in the title background color), then strap him to the same chair he was strapped to and force him to watch the same TV monitors while the chicken and his girlfriend share a kiss.<ref name=\"adultswim1\">{{cite web |url=http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/robot-chicken-opening.html |title=Robot Chicken Opening \u2013 Robot Chicken \u2013 Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928025934/http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/robot-chicken-opening.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the eighth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with the Robot Chicken being uncovered in snow, frozen in a block of ice, by robots. Taken to a futuristic laboratory, the Robot Chicken is taken out of [[suspended animation]] by a masked scientist, revealed to be a [[Lineal descendant|descendant]] of the mad scientist who first reanimated the Robot Chicken. The descendant mad scientist then proceeds to force the Robot Chicken to watch a wall of projected images with different shows, as his [[ancestor]] did before him. This new opening was necessary following the plot of last season's episode \"Chipotle Miserables\" in which the mad scientist's son rips out his father's remaining eye to open a door controlled by an optical [[biometric]] reader, and then creates a posse of reanimated cyborg animals, as well as a cyborg homeless person. The posse then proceeds to kidnap all 5 living Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]]. The Robot Chicken and mad scientist then team up to rescue the presidents, after which, the Robot Chicken flies away, free.\n\nBeginning in the tenth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with the Nerd being turned into a cyborg by both the Robot Chicken and the mad scientist and being forced to watch the skits while they high five. This is a result of the previous season finale where the Nerd dies from a cliff jump stunt in order to get the show renewed. The letters TEN in the title have been also highlighted as to mark the show reaching ten seasons.\n\n==Characters==\nWhile ''Robot Chicken'' uses a variety of famous real people and fictional characters, it also has original characters created exclusively for the show.\n\n*'''Robot Chicken''' (vocal effects by [[Seth Green]]) - The show's titular character. He is a cyborg chicken with a red laser eye revived by a mad scientist. In the 100th episode, he was freed by a maid and later kills his creator after he kidnaps his girlfriend.\n\n*'''Cluckerella''' (vocal effects by Seth Green) - The Robot Chicken's girlfriend. She wears a dress and has hair and lipstick.\n\n*'''The Mad Scientist''' (voiced by [[Les Claypool]]) - A scientist who revived the Robot Chicken. He has wild hair and an evil grin. Starting with season 3, his name was revealed to be Fritz Huhnmorder, which was seen at the gravestone. He was killed by the Robot Chicken after the events of the 100th episode only for him to be revived as a cyborg.\n\n*'''The Nerd''' (voiced by Seth Green) - A boy with square-framed glasses. He appears in many episodes and often ends up in wild situations in famous media. He died in the season 9 finale only for him to get revived as a cyborg.\n\n*'''Bitch Pudding''' (voiced by [[Katee Sackhoff]]) - A parody of [[Strawberry Shortcake]]. She is a violent woman and often kills people. She has a season 7 episode dedicated to her, \"Bitch Pudding Special\".\n\n*'''Unicorn''' (voiced by [[George Lowe]]) - A white [[unicorn]] with perverted tendencies.\n\n*'''Mo-Larr''' (voiced by [[Michael Ian Black]]) - A dentist who takes care of [[Skeletor]].\n\n*'''Composite Santa''' (voiced by [[Christian Slater]]) - A monster who is half [[Santa Claus]], half [[snowman]].\n\n*'''Humping Robot''' - A robot who humps machines (most commonly a [[washing machine]]).\n\n*'''MC Broccoli''' (voiced by Seth Green) - An anthropomorphic [[broccoli]] who is a rapper.\n\n*'''Blooper Host''' (voiced by [[Jamie Kaler]]) - The host of the blooper sketches, who often does stupid things such as killing himself at the end. He often says tongue-in-cheek phrases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Robot Chicken episodes}}\n{{:List of Robot Chicken episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|DVD title\n!colspan=\"3\"|Release date\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ep #\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Discs\n|-\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|[[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|Region 2\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|Region 4\n|-\n|[[Robot Chicken (season 1)|Season One]]\n|March 28, 2006\n|September 29, 2008 \n|April 4, 2007\n|1\u201320\n|2\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: left\"|This two-disc boxset includes all 20 episodes from Season 1 in production order.

However, someone at Cartoon Network passed the pitch along to [[Adult Swim]], around the same time that Seth MacFarlane told Seth Green and Matthew Senreich to pitch the show to Adult Swim.\n\nThe show mocks popular culture, referencing [[toy]]s, [[Film|movie]]s, [[television]], [[game]]s, popular fads, and more obscure references like anime cartoons and older television programs, much in the same vein as comedy sketch shows like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"askmeninterview\">{{cite web | url=http://ie.askmen.com/celebs/interview_300/328_seth-green-interview.html| title= Seth Green Interview | publisher= askmen.com| accessdate= 2013-05-02}}</ref> It employs [[stop motion]] animation of [[toy]]s, [[action figure]]s, [[Clay animation|claymation]], and various other objects, such as tongue depressors, [[The Game of Life]] pegs, and popsicle sticks.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/episodes/3902/Robot_Chicken_Constantine_Dark_Tip.html |title=Video Games, Game Reviews & News |publisher=G4tv.com |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref>\n\nOne particular motif involves the idea of fantastical characters being placed in a more realistic world or situation (such as [[Stretch Armstrong]] requiring a corn syrup transplant after losing his abilities because of aging, [[Optimus Prime]] performing a prostate cancer [[Public service announcement|PSA]] for the humans, and [[Godzilla]] having problems in the bedroom).<ref name=\"askmeninterview\"/> The program aired a 30-minute episode dedicated to ''[[Star Wars]]'' which premiered June 17, 2007, in the US, featuring the voices of ''Star Wars'' notables [[George Lucas]], [[Mark Hamill]] (from a [[List of Robot Chicken episodes#6|previous episode]]), [[Billy Dee Williams]], and [[Ahmed Best]].<ref name=usa>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-06-12-robot-chicken_N.htm|title='Robot Chicken' digs its satirical talons into 'Star Wars'|accessdate=2008-11-02|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Mike Snider|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref> The ''Star Wars'' episode was nominated for a 2008 [[Emmy]] Award as Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour).\n\nThe show airs in the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s [[Adult Swim UK|Adult Swim]] block, in Canada on [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]]'s [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)#The Detour on Teletoon and F-Night|TELETOON at Night]] block, in [[Australia]] on [[The Comedy Channel]]'s Adult Swim block, in Russia on 2x2's Adult Swim block, in Germany on TNT Series' Adult Swim block, and in [[Latin America]] on the [[I.Sat]] Adult Swim block (after the Adult Swim block was canceled from [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]] Latin America in 2008).

Midway through the opening sequence, the titular chicken turns his laser eye towards the camera, and the title appears amidst the \"laser effects\" as [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] can be heard screaming \"It's alive!\" \u00e0 la ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. Claypool also composed and performed the show's theme song. The mad scientist then straps the re-animated Robot Chicken into a chair, uses [[calipers]] to hold his eyes open, and forces him to watch a bank of television monitors (with allusions to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''); this scene [[segue]]s into the body of the show, which resembles someone frequently changing TV channels.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn the episode \"1987\", [[Michael Ian Black]] claims in the \"Best Robot Chicken Ever\" sketch that this sequence tells the viewers that they are the chicken, being forced to watch the skits. As a result, the show does not actually focus on the Robot Chicken until the 100th episode, when he finally makes his escape and later kills the mad scientist when he takes his hen girlfriend Cluckerella.\n\nBeginning in the sixth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with a role reversal (after the events of the show's 100th episode). The Robot Chicken comes upon the body of the scientist, which has been decapitated. He decides to do to the scientist what the mad scientist did to him: add robotic parts to him, turn him into a cyborg, and give him a laser eye (although he gives the scientist a blue eye instead of a red one, which necessitates a change in the title background color), then strap him to the same chair he was strapped to and force him to watch the same TV monitors while the chicken and his girlfriend share a kiss.<ref name=\"adultswim1\">{{cite web |url=http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/robot-chicken-opening.html |title=Robot Chicken Opening \u2013 Robot Chicken \u2013 Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928025934/http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/robot-chicken-opening.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the eighth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with the Robot Chicken being uncovered in snow, frozen in a block of ice, by robots. Taken to a futuristic laboratory, the Robot Chicken is taken out of [[suspended animation]] by a masked scientist, revealed to be a [[Lineal descendant|descendant]] of the mad scientist who first reanimated the Robot Chicken. The descendant mad scientist then proceeds to force the Robot Chicken to watch a wall of projected images with different shows, as his [[ancestor]] did before him. This new opening was necessary following the plot of last season's episode \"Chipotle Miserables\" in which the mad scientist's son rips out his father's remaining eye to open a door controlled by an optical [[biometric]] reader, and then creates a posse of reanimated cyborg animals, as well as a cyborg homeless person. The posse then proceeds to kidnap all 5 living Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]]. The Robot Chicken and mad scientist then team up to rescue the presidents, after which, the Robot Chicken flies away, free.\n\nBeginning in the tenth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with the Nerd being turned into a cyborg by both the Robot Chicken and the mad scientist and being forced to watch the skits while they high five. This is a result of the previous season finale where the Nerd dies from a cliff jump stunt in order to get the show renewed. The letters TEN in the title have been also highlighted as to mark the show reaching ten seasons.\n\n==Characters==\nWhile ''Robot Chicken'' uses a variety of famous real people and fictional characters, it also has original characters created exclusively for the show.\n\n*'''Robot Chicken''' (vocal effects by [[Seth Green]]) - The show's titular character. He is a cyborg chicken with a red laser eye revived by a mad scientist. In the 100th episode, he was freed by a maid and later kills his creator after he kidnaps his girlfriend.\n\n*'''Cluckerella''' (vocal effects by Seth Green) - The Robot Chicken's girlfriend. She wears a dress and has hair and lipstick.\n\n*'''The Mad Scientist''' (voiced by [[Les Claypool]]) - A scientist who revived the Robot Chicken. He has wild hair and an evil grin. Starting with season 3, his name was revealed to be Fritz Huhnmorder, which was seen at the gravestone. He was killed by the Robot Chicken after the events of the 100th episode only for him to be revived as a cyborg.\n\n*'''The Nerd''' (voiced by Seth Green) - A boy with square-framed glasses. He appears in many episodes and often ends up in wild situations in famous media. He died in the season 9 finale only for him to get revived as a cyborg.\n\n*'''Bitch Pudding''' (voiced by [[Katee Sackhoff]]) - A parody of [[Strawberry Shortcake]]. She is a violent woman and often kills people. She has a season 7 episode dedicated to her, \"Bitch Pudding Special\".\n\n*'''Unicorn''' (voiced by [[George Lowe]]) - A white [[unicorn]] with perverted tendencies.\n\n*'''Mo-Larr''' (voiced by [[Michael Ian Black]]) - A dentist who takes care of [[Skeletor]].\n\n*'''Composite Santa''' (voiced by [[Christian Slater]]) - A monster who is half [[Santa Claus]], half [[snowman]].\n\n*'''Humping Robot''' - A robot who humps machines (most commonly a [[washing machine]]).\n\n*'''MC Broccoli''' (voiced by Seth Green) - An anthropomorphic [[broccoli]] who is a rapper.\n\n*'''Blooper Host''' (voiced by [[Jamie Kaler]]) - The host of the blooper sketches, who often does stupid things such as killing himself at the end. He often says tongue-in-cheek phrases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Robot Chicken episodes}}\n{{:List of Robot Chicken episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|DVD title\n!colspan=\"3\"|Release date\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ep #\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Discs\n|-\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|[[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|Region 2\n! style=\"width:17%;\"|Region 4\n|-\n|[[Robot Chicken (season 1)|Season One]]\n|March 28, 2006\n|September 29, 2008 \n|April 4, 2007\n|1\u201320\n|2\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: left\"|This two-disc boxset includes all 20 episodes from Season 1 in production order.

\n([[masters degree|masters' level]]) specializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or ''Machshavah''. \n[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\n[[Machon Tal]], <ref name =\"tal\">[https://www.jct.ac.il/%d7%a7%d7%9e%d7%a4%d7%95%d7%a1%d7%99%d7%9d/%d7%a7%d7%9e%d7%a4%d7%95%d7%a1-%d7%98%d7%9c/%d7%9e%d7%93%d7%a8%d7%a9%d7%aa-%d7%98%d7%9c/%d7%90%d7%95%d7%93%d7%95%d7%aa \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea-\u05d8\u05dc], jct.ac.il</ref> associated with JCT, the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offers degrees in engineering and management. \n\nMost Haredi and Hasidic seminaries likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

These are usually structured around continuing / [[adult education]], and accept both men and women.
