A [[leading man]] for most of his career, he specialized in [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and [[film noir]] throughout the 1950s, in films such as [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950), [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956). He became noted for supporting roles in the 1960s, perhaps most memorably as General Jack D. Ripper in Kubrick's ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964).\n\nHayden's success continued into the [[New Hollywood]] era, with roles such as Irish-American policeman [[Captain McCluskey (The Godfather)|Captain McCluskey]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), alcoholic novelist Roger Wade in [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and elderly peasant Leo Dalc\u00f2 in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' (1976).

It went on the cover of a magazine prompting Paramount Pictures to call and offer a screen test. Hayden did a test in New York with Jeanne Cagney, James Cagney's sister. Hayden:\n<blockquote>I was completely lost, ignorant, nervous. But the next thing I knew, Paramount made me a seven-year contract beginning at $250 a week, which was astronomical. I got my lovely old mother and bought a car, and we drove to California... I was so lost then I didn't think to analyze it. I said, 'This is nuts, but, damned, it's pleasant.' I had only one plan in mind: to get $5,000. I knew where there was a schooner, and then I'd haul ass.<ref name=\"globe\">Sterling Hayden's a seadog at heart Peary, Gerald.

In it, he reminisces about turning points in his life:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe sun beats down and you pace, you pace and you pace. Your mind flies free and you see yourself as an actor, condemned to a treadmill wherein men and women conspire to breathe life into a screenplay that allegedly depicts life as it was in the old wild West. You see yourself coming awake any one of a thousand mornings between the spring of 1954, and that of 1958\u2014alone in a double bed in a big white house deep in suburban Sherman Oaks, not far from Hollywood.\n\nThe windows are open wide, and beyond these is the backyard swimming pool inert and green, within a picket fence. You turn and gaze at a pair of desks not far from the double bed. This is your private office, the place that shelters your fondest hopes: these desks so neat, patiently waiting for the day that never comes, the day you'll sit down at last and begin to write.\n\nWhy did you never write? Why, instead, did you grovel along, through the endless months and years, as a motion\u2011picture actor? What held you to it, to something you so vehemently professed to despise? Could it be that you secretly liked it\u2014that the big dough and the big house and the high life meant more than the aura you spun for those around you to see?\n\n\"Hayden's wild,\" they said. \"He's kind of nuts\u2014but you've got to hand it to him. He doesn't give a damn about the loot or the stardom or things like that\u2014something to do with his seafaring, or maybe what he went through in the war . . .\"<ref name=wanderer/>{{rp|151}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1964 Hayden appeared in ''[[A Carol for Another Christmas]]'' on TV.

He became noted for supporting roles in the 1960s, perhaps most memorably as General Jack D. Ripper in Kubrick's ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964).\n\nHayden's success continued into the [[New Hollywood]] era, with roles such as Irish-American policeman [[Captain McCluskey (The Godfather)|Captain McCluskey]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), alcoholic novelist Roger Wade in [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and elderly peasant Leo Dalc\u00f2 in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' (1976).

It went on the cover of a magazine prompting Paramount Pictures to call and offer a screen test. Hayden did a test in New York with Jeanne Cagney, James Cagney's sister. Hayden:\n<blockquote>I was completely lost, ignorant, nervous. But the next thing I knew, Paramount made me a seven-year contract beginning at $250 a week, which was astronomical. I got my lovely old mother and bought a car, and we drove to California... I was so lost then I didn't think to analyze it. I said, 'This is nuts, but, damned, it's pleasant.' I had only one plan in mind: to get $5,000. I knew where there was a schooner, and then I'd haul ass.<ref name=\"globe\">Sterling Hayden's a seadog at heart Peary, Gerald.

He enlisted in the army, trained in Scotland, but broke his ankle and was let out.<ref name=\"names\"/>\n\nHe returned to the US and tried to buy a half-interest in a schooner but could not raise the money. He joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a private, under the name John Hamilton, an alias he never used otherwise. While at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], he was recommended for [[Officer Candidate School]].\n\nAfter graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and was transferred to service as an undercover agent with [[William J.

Hayden, who also participated in the Naples\u2013Foggia campaign and established air crew rescue teams in enemy-occupied territory, became a first lieutenant on September 13, 1944, and a captain on February 14, 1945.\n\nHe received the [[Silver Star]] (for gallantry in action in the Balkans and Mediterranean; \"Lt.

It was only a minor hit but was highly regarded critically and established Hayden as a leading man.\n\nHe played a minister who doubts his faith in ''[[Journey into Light]]'' (1952), then supported [[Bette Davis]] as ''[[The Star (1952 film)|The Star]]'' (1952).

In it, he reminisces about turning points in his life:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe sun beats down and you pace, you pace and you pace. Your mind flies free and you see yourself as an actor, condemned to a treadmill wherein men and women conspire to breathe life into a screenplay that allegedly depicts life as it was in the old wild West. You see yourself coming awake any one of a thousand mornings between the spring of 1954, and that of 1958\u2014alone in a double bed in a big white house deep in suburban Sherman Oaks, not far from Hollywood.\n\nThe windows are open wide, and beyond these is the backyard swimming pool inert and green, within a picket fence. You turn and gaze at a pair of desks not far from the double bed. This is your private office, the place that shelters your fondest hopes: these desks so neat, patiently waiting for the day that never comes, the day you'll sit down at last and begin to write.\n\nWhy did you never write? Why, instead, did you grovel along, through the endless months and years, as a motion\u2011picture actor? What held you to it, to something you so vehemently professed to despise? Could it be that you secretly liked it\u2014that the big dough and the big house and the high life meant more than the aura you spun for those around you to see?\n\n\"Hayden's wild,\" they said. \"He's kind of nuts\u2014but you've got to hand it to him. He doesn't give a damn about the loot or the stardom or things like that\u2014something to do with his seafaring, or maybe what he went through in the war . . .\"<ref name=wanderer/>{{rp|151}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1964 Hayden appeared in ''[[A Carol for Another Christmas]]'' on TV.

He led the movement from 1926 until his death in 1957.\n\nRokeach inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov Rokeach]], upon the latter's death in 1926. Known for his piety and mysticism, Rokeach was called the \"Wonder Rabbi\" by Jews and gentiles alike for the [[miracle]]s he performed. \n\nHis reign as Rebbe saw the devastation of the Belz community, along with that of many other Hasidic sects in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and elsewhere in [[Poland]] during [[the Holocaust]]. During the Holocaust, Rebbe Aharon was high on the list of [[Gestapo]] targets as a high-profile Rebbe. With the support and financial assistance of Belzer Hasidim in Mandatory Palestine, England and the United States, he and his half-brother, Rabbi [[Mordechai Rokeach|Mordechai of Bilgoray]], managed to escape from Poland into Hungary, then into Turkey, Lebanon, and finally into [[Mandatory Palestine]] in February 1944. After Rabbi Mordechai's sudden death in November 1949, Rokeach raised his half-brother's year-old son, [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (fifth Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov]], and groomed him to succeed him as Belzer Rebbe.\n\n==Early life==\nRokeach was the first child born to his parents, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach and Basha Ruchama Twersky, after 12 years of marriage. He was named after his mother's great-grandfather, Rebbe Aharon of Chernobyl, although his father later revealed that he intended to name the boy after Rabbi Aharon of Karlin. Aharon had a younger sister, Chana Rachel, who later married Rabbi Pinchas Twersky of Ostilla.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nRokeach's mother died on 18 March 1884 when he was 4 years old.<ref name=\"rescue\" /> His grandfather, Rebbe [[Yehoshua Rokeach]], the second Belzer Rebbe, took the boy under his wing and oversaw his spiritual development. As he grew, he spent much of his day ensconced in Torah learning and ate and slept little. He also concealed his accomplishments with a modesty that would last throughout his lifetime.\n\nWhen his grandfather died on 30 January 1894, Rokeach's father became the third Belzer Rebbe. Rebbe Yissachar Dov remarried to Chaya Devora Pecsenik and had another seven children. Rokeach was 22 years old when his half-brother Mordechai was born.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nWhen he came of age, Rokeach married his cousin, Malka, the daughter of his father's elder brother Shmuel, the Rav of [[Sokal]]. After his marriage, he lived with his father-in-law for several years. His strict regime of seclusion, deprivation and asceticism caused him to become seriously weakened, whereupon his doctors recommended a complete change of locale and sent him to a spa. Though he recuperated at the health resort of Kreniec, he still ate little, and his chronic [[sleep deprivation]] made it difficult for him to stand or walk quickly. On Shabbat, however, he would stand upright, walk quickly, and partake in the Shabbat meals with obvious pleasure.<ref name=\"rescue\" /> \n\nHe and his wife had five sons and four daughters. Several apparently healthy children died at birth, while those that survived were sickly and weak. Two daughters were both hearing- and speech-impaired. One daughter, Mirel, died in 1938; the rest were killed by the Nazis with their families.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nWhen Rokeach's father, Rebbe Yissachar Dov, died in [[Belz]] on [[Shabbat|Friday night]], 30 October 1926, his 46-year-old son accepted the mantle of leadership at the funeral held after Shabbat.\n\n==Becoming the Rebbe==\nWhile he continued to live a Spartan and reclusive existence, Rokeach revealed himself to be a warm and caring leader. He read each ''[[kvitel]]'' with great interest and prayed for the petitioner's salvation and success. At first he tried to limit the number of petitioners who sought his counsel and blessing to five per night, saying, \"I simply can't take these ''tzoros'' (tribulations) of ''Klal Yisrael''!\" as he felt each problem as deeply as if it were his own. But eventually he allowed many petitioners to see him nightly.<ref name = \"rescue\" /> \n\nAlthough the position of Belzer rav included being rabbi of the local township, Rokeach said he could not spare any more time. Two [[bet din|dayanim]] were appointed for this task, and they consulted with Rokeach only on difficult [[halakha|halakhic]] questions.\n\n==Escape from Europe==\nDuring World War II, Belzer Hasidim both inside and outside [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied Europe saw saving the Rebbe as their primary goal.

He led the movement from 1926 until his death in 1957.\n\nRebbe Aharon inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov Rokeach]], upon the latter's death in 1926. Known for his piety and mysticism, Rebbe Aharon was called the \"Wonder Rabbi\" by Jews and gentiles alike for the [[miracle]]s he performed. \n\nHis reign as Rebbe saw the devastation of the Belz community, along with that of many other Hasidic sects in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and elsewhere in [[Poland]] during [[the Holocaust]]. During the Holocaust, Rebbe Aharon was high on the list of [[Gestapo]] targets as a high-profile Rebbe. With the support and financial assistance of Belzer Hasidim in Mandatory Palestine, England and the United States, he and his half-brother, Rabbi [[Mordechai Rokeach|Mordechai of Bilgoray]], managed to escape from Poland into Hungary, then into Turkey, Lebanon, and finally into [[Mandatory Palestine]] in February 1944. After Rabbi Mordechai's sudden death in November 1949, Rebbe Aharon raised his half-brother's year-old son, [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (fifth Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov]], and groomed him to succeed him as Belzer Rebbe.\n\n==Early life==\nAharon was the first child born to his parents, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach and Basha Ruchama Twersky, after 12 years of marriage. He was named after his mother's great-grandfather, Rebbe Aharon of Chernobyl, although his father later revealed that he intended to name the boy after Rabbi Aharon of Karlin. Aharon had a younger sister, Chana Rachel, who later married Rabbi Pinchas Twersky of Ostilla.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nAharon's mother died on 18 March 1884 when Aharon was 4 years old.<ref name=\"rescue\" /> His grandfather, Rebbe [[Yehoshua Rokeach]], the second Belzer Rebbe, took the boy under his wing and oversaw his spiritual development. As he grew, Aharon spent much of his day ensconced in Torah learning and ate and slept little. He also concealed his accomplishments with a modesty that would last throughout his lifetime.\n\nWhen his grandfather died on 30 January 1894, Aharon's father became the third Belzer Rebbe. Rebbe Yissachar Dov remarried to Chaya Devora Pecsenik and had another seven children. Rebbe Aharon was 22 years old when his half-brother Mordechai was born.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nWhen he came of age, Rebbe Aharon married his cousin, Malka, the daughter of his father's elder brother Shmuel, the Rav of [[Sokal]]. After his marriage, Aharon lived with his father-in-law for several years. His strict regime of seclusion, deprivation and asceticism caused him to become seriously weakened, whereupon his doctors recommended a complete change of locale and sent him to a spa. Though he recuperated at the health resort of Kreniec, he still ate little, and his chronic [[sleep deprivation]] made it difficult for him to stand or walk quickly. On Shabbat, however, he would stand upright, walk quickly, and partake in the Shabbat meals with obvious pleasure.<ref name=\"rescue\" /> \n\nHe and his wife had five sons and four daughters. Several apparently healthy children died at birth, while those that survived were sickly and weak. Two daughters were both hearing- and speech-impaired. One daughter, Mirel, died in 1938; the rest were killed by the Nazis with their families.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nWhen Aharon's father, Rebbe Yissachar Dov, died in [[Belz]] on [[Shabbat|Friday night]], 30 October 1926, his 46-year-old son accepted the mantle of leadership at the funeral held after Shabbat.\n\n==Becoming the Rebbe==\nWhile he continued to live a Spartan and reclusive existence, Rebbe Aharon revealed himself to be a warm and caring leader. He read each ''[[kvitel]]'' with great interest and prayed for the petitioner's salvation and success. At first he tried to limit the number of petitioners who sought his counsel and blessing to five per night, saying, \"I simply can't take these ''tzoros'' (tribulations) of ''Klal Yisrael''!\" as he felt each problem as deeply as if it were his own. But eventually he allowed many petitioners to see him nightly.<ref name = \"rescue\" /> \n\nAlthough the position of Belzer rav included being rabbi of the local township,  Rebbe Aharon said he could not spare any more time. Two [[bet din|dayanim]] were appointed for this task, and they consulted with Rebbe Aharon only on difficult [[halakha|halakhic]] questions.\n\n==Escape from Europe==\nDuring World War II, Belzer Hasidim both inside and outside [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied Europe saw saving the Rebbe as their primary goal. They spirited Rebbe Aharon &mdash; who insisted on being accompanied by his half-brother, Rabbi Mordechai &mdash; out of Belz into [[Wi\u015bnicz]], then into the [[Bochnia]] Ghetto, then into the [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]], and then back into the Bochnia Ghetto, narrowly avoiding Gestapo roundups and deportations.<ref name=\"rescue\" />\n\nIn their most hair-raising escape attempt, the brothers were driven out of occupied Poland and into Hungary by a Hungarian [[counter-intelligence]] agent who was friendly to Jews.

As the New Year arrives and the reviewers find their favorite joints already booked, the fairy brothel owner introduces them to a dream eater brothel where they can revisit their choice of succu-girls inside their dreams.|\n| Viewers_1           = \n| OriginalAirDate_6   = \n| OriginalAirDate_7   = \n| OriginalAirDate_8   = \n| OriginalAirDate_9   = \n| Viewers_5           = \n| Viewers_2           = \n| Viewers_3           = \n| Viewers_4           = \n| OriginalAirDate_4   = \n| Viewers_6           = \n| Viewers_7           = \n| Viewers_8           = \n| OriginalAirDate_5   = \n| Title_8             = \n| OriginalAirDate_3   = \n| OriginalAirDate_2   = \n| OriginalAirDate_1   = \n| Title_9             = \n| Title_7             = \n| Title_6             = \n| Title_5             = \n| Title_4             = \n| Title_3             = \n| Title_2             = \n| Title_1             = \n| Viewers             = \n| WrittenBy           = \n| DirectedBy          = \n| EpisodeNumber2      = \n| Viewers_9           = \n}}\n|}\n\n==Reception==\nIn August 2017, the manga was awarded the \"DLsite Award\" by [[Media Factory]]'s manga news magazine ''Da Vinci'' and the streaming service [[Niconico]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-08-27/gaku-kuze-uramichi-oniisan-aka-akasaka-kaguya-sama-love-is-war-win-tsugi-ni-kuru-manga-awards/.120469 |title=Gaku Kuze's Uramichi Oniisan, Aka Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War Win Tsugi ni Kuru Manga Awards |last=Sherman |first=Jennifer |date=August 27, 2017 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=June 28, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.fujimishobo.co.jp/sp/201709ishuzoku/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|https://isyuzoku.com/|Anime official website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ANN|manga|21098}}\n\n{{Passione}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Interspecies Reviewers}}\n[[Category:2020 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga controversies]]\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:Censored television series]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fujimi Shobo manga]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category:LGBT in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:Passione (company)]]\n[[Category:Sex comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Television censorship in Japan]]\n[[Category:Yen Press titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese sex comedy manga and anime series}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Interspecies Reviewers\n| image           = Interspecies Reviewers, volume 1.jpg\n| caption         = Cover of the first manga ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volume\n| ja_kanji        = \u7570\u7a2e\u65cf\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba\n| ja_romaji       = Ishuzoku Rebyu\u0101zu\n| genre           = [[Fantasy]], [[sex comedy]]<ref name=\"12ep\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Interspecies Reviewers - The Fall 2018 Manga Guide |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2018-11-30/the-fall-2018-manga-guide/interspecies-reviewers/.140194 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 7, 2020 |date=November 30, 2018 |quote=Probably the biggest strike against this book is that it aspires to be a sex comedy but seems to have left out the comedy part.
