They also spend more time outside and are thus more exposed to it. <ref name=\"Harris, MAY 29, 2015\">{{Cite news|last1=HARRIS|first1=GARDINER|title=Holding Your Breath in India|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/opinion/sunday/holding-your-breath-in-india.html?_r=0|work=SundayReview, New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=29 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on adults===\nPoor air quality is a cause of reduced lung capacity, headaches, sore throats, coughs, fatigue, lung cancer, and early death.<ref name=\"Summary of risk assessment\"/><ref name=\"Harris, MAY 29, 2015\"/>\n\n== Smog in Delhi ==\n{{Infobox event\n|title=Smog in Delhi\n|image=Low visibility due to Smog at New Delhi Railway station 31st Dec 2017 after 9AM DSCN8829 1.jpg\n|caption=Low visibility due to [[:en:Smog|Smog]] at [[:en:New Delhi railway station|New Delhi railway station]] 31 December 2017.

It received mostly positive reviews, as well as one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] win, six [[Annie Award]] nominations, and two additional Emmy Award nominations during its run. The series finale, \"Chowder Grows Up\", aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series follows an aspiring young chef apprentice named Chowder and his day-to-day adventures in Chef Mung Daal's [[catering]] company. Although he means well, Chowder often finds himself in predicaments due to his [[Gourmand|perpetual appetite]] and his nature as a [[wikt:scatterbrain|scatterbrain]]. It is animated with both [[traditional animation]] as well as short [[stop motion]] and [[puppet]] sequences that are inter-cut into episodes and the end credits. Stop motion sequences are produced by [[Screen Novelties]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{fanpov|section|date=December 2019}}\nEach character is named after a type of food or dish.\n\n===Main===\n*'''Chowder''' (voiced by [[Nicky Jones (actor)|Nicky Jones]]): A 12-year-old chubby purple {{not a typo|[[cat]]/[[bear]]/[[rabbit]]}}<ref name=CNUKfacts>{{cite web|title=Character Facts of the Week: Chowder|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-chowder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910053503/http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-chowder|archivedate=September 10, 2014|date=March 20, 2012|quote=Chowder is a mix between a cat, bear, and rabbit.}}</ref> hybrid who serves as an apprentice under the chef [[Mung Daal]], Chowder lives with Mung Daal and his wife, Truffles, in a room at the top of the catering business. Chowder wants to become a great chef, but he is very impulsive and scatterbrained and often gives in to his urges. He is always hungry and eats anything, even a customer's order. Chowder can also regurgitate objects, and he is used as a storage container by the other characters. According to Greenblatt, he is a composite of a cat, a bear and a rabbit, and his species was verified in at least one episode.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Puckerberry Overlords|series=Chowder|airdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> C.

Shnitzel is the \"[[straight man]]\" to the other more excitable characters and is frequently agitated. He gets stuck with menial labor or cleanup duty, as well as the heavy lifting because he is extremely strong. Although usually angered by Chowder's antics, Shnitzel really has a soft spot for Chowder, as he cries when it was thought that Chowder has vanished forever.<ref name=\"radda\"/><ref name=\"chowder-prem\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/10/just-two-weeks-until-chowder-premiere.html|title=Just Two Weeks Until Chowder Premiere|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118022353/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/10/just-two-weeks-until-chowder-premiere.html|archive-date=November 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Shnitzel for the debut episode \"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\" and was replaced at the last moment by DiMaggio due to Richardson being busy with other projects at the time.<ref name=\"radda\"/> In the final episode, Schnitzel has left the catering company and live a happy life with his wife, Endive.\n*'''Truffles Daal''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]): A [[mushroom]] [[pixie]]/[[fairy]] and Mung Daal's wife who handles the business side of Mung's catering business.

H. Greenblatt): Chowder's pet, who lives in a cage next to his bed. Kimchi is an anthropomorphic flatus (due to the unpleasant odor of [[kimchi]]). He likes things with odors unpleasant for the other characters, and he \"talks\" by making flatulent sounds. Kimchi was first seen in the episode \"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\". Kimchi is usually shown with a blank personality but in \"Stinky Love\" it is shown that he has an opinion.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> What happens to Kimchi in the final episode is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that he still lives with Chowder.\n*'''Gazpacho''' (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]): A [[woolly mammoth]] storekeeper who sells strange [[produce]] and ingredients at the farmer's market. He does his best to offer advice to Chowder when needed. He lives with his overbearing mother, who never appears on screen, but is present at the end of episode \"Gazpacho!\". In \"The Spookiest House in Marzipan\" it is hinted at that Gazpacho has no mother, and that he actually suffers with [[dissociative identity disorder]], but creator Greenblatt says this was merely to \"pay homage to ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''\". Gazpacho shows no interest in moving out and improving his own life. Gazpacho's worst enemies are [[ninja]]s. Greenblatt named him after the cold soup [[gazpacho]]; Greenblatt said that he did not know why, but the name suited the character immediately.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gazpacho closed the stand, and became a nomad. He later pursued his dream and open a Comedy Night Club.\n*'''Panini''' (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): A 12-year-old pink [[cabbit]] who has a crush on Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the feelings and responds with \"I'm not your boyfriend!\" whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. Endive, and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her [[bullying|bully]] Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to [[Angelica Pickles]] from ''[[Rugrats]]''.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|title=Early Endive & Panini Designs|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 15, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054958/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|archive-date=July 14, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not fit in with the rounded shapes in ''Chowder''. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini \"cuter and sweeter\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough to fall in love with females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder \"in a more fun way\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. Panini's name literally means \"sandwiches\" in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans. In the final episode Panini married Chowder, and is currently a mother of 50, she then promised Chowder to stop having more. It\u2019s also likely that she took over Truffles old job.\n*'''Gorgonzola''' (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green [[rat]] apprentice candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder having a better job than him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|title=Gorgonzola|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107091545/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|archive-date=November 7, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since [[blue cheese]] was one of the few foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name \"[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]\" for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green [[opossum]] or a green [[rat]]. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode ''Sniffleball''. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gorgonzola runs a very successful company, most likely involving candle holding.\n*'''Ms. Endive''' (voiced by [[Mindy Sterling]]): An [[obesity|obese]], intelligent, and somewhat snobbish 46-year-old female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This is shown in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\" where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode \"Chowder's Girlfriend\", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fianc\u00e9 did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, \"Chowder's Girlfriend\". The creator describes her as [[Martha Stewart]] with [[Oompa-Loompa]] colors.<ref name=\"endive\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|title=Ms. Endive|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=April 19, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118022158/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|archive-date=November 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt chose to name her after the [[endive]] since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy.<ref name=\"food\"/> Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the final episode, Endive is living a happy life with her Husband, Schnitzel.\n\n===Recurring===\n*'''Kiwi''' (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a [[photorealistic]] pink creature who always gives advice to Chowder and his friends and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. His name is revealed (for the first and only time ever in the show's run) in the episode \"Brain Grub\", where it is known that after Chowder alters the animated universe, Kiwi is reduced to selling used cars.\n*'''Ceviche''' (voiced by Elan Garfias): A young yellow (and somewhat androgynous) [[goat]] apprentice to Pat\u00e9 and Panini's best friend, Ceviche was introduced in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\". He practices aerobic-style dancing and is very charitable and kind to others. Because of his admirable attitude and amazing talents (as well as good looks, as it was shown on one episode that he has a well-sculpted body) he is well-liked.  He is good friends with Panini and will make unwanted advances upon her, which are either refused or unnoticed. Ceviche is also a close friend to Chowder. He has a crush on Panini.  He speaks in a [[wikt:monotone|monotonous]] voice and serves as [[deadpan]] humor for the show.\n*'''Pat\u00e9''' (voiced by John DiMaggio): A tall, well-sculpted [[humanoid]] ballet dance master and operatic singer with a deep voice, grass-green hair, a small black hat, and exaggerated lips who is the mentor of Ceviche. Pat\u00e9 was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show ''Chowder's Girlfriend'' (Episode #1b), where he sings \"I'm Not Your Boyfriend\" on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) in front of an audience. His name, however, was revealed for the first time on ''The Apprentice Games'' (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.\n*'''Chestnut''' (originally voiced by [[Tone L\u014dc]], then [[John DiMaggio]]): Like the food, Chestnut is small and tough. He is a tiny, [[blue]] horned [[devil]]-like creature with a deep, gravelly voice and, to many character's surprise, is physically very strong.  Because of his size, he uses everyday objects as other things (e.g. using a briefcase for a hydrofoil, or a hat as a vacation home). He sings small songs to himself, usually consisting of his catchphrase of \"Dinka-loo, dinka-lee.\" He is teacher of the BLTs, a parody of the [[SAT]]s. He always refers to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] when speaking.\n*'''Reuben''' (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]): A pig who is a [[confidence trick|conman]] and steals from others.\n*'''Mr. Fugu''' (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]): A sentient floating balloon who is said to be Mung's most frequent customer. He is proven to be more greedy than Chowder and never shares any food with him. He is often seen with his valet, Foie Gras, a [[Maneki-neko]] (meows provided by [[George Takei]]) holding Mr. Fugu's string as he cannot control his flotation.\n*'''Sgt. Hoagie''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): He is a [[dog]] who is a police officer in Marzipan City. In ''The Hot Date'', he was going out on a date after several years and asked the other cops for advice.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chowder episodes}}\n{{:List of Chowder episodes}}\nA total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled \"The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend\". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special \"The Apprentice Games\". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with \"The Arborians/The Garage Sale\", and ending with \"A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown\", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with \"The Blast Raz\", and ending with the series finale, entitled \"Chowder Grows Up\", which aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:ChowderPuppets.jpg|thumb|The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal]]\nDuring his time working on Nickelodeon's ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/> Some of the inspiration comes from [[Dr. Seuss]], with other inspiration from [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/><ref name=\"armada\">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |title=Meet the Master Chef&nbsp;\u2013 C.H.

Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on ''Chowder'' before the show made it to air in 2007.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/>\n\n==Production and format==\nEpisodes are produced in seasons which consist of twenty 24-minute episodes. Each episode is produced with a 30-second puppet sequence that is meant to run over the ending credits.<ref name=\"season2\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/06/let-new-chowders-begin.html|title=Let the New Chowders Begin!!|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 3, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708054506/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/06/let-new-chowders-begin.html|archive-date=July 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Episodes can be purchased from the [[iTunes Store]] in the United States which are delivered with the sequences as are episodes which are available on Cartoon Network's VOD website also within the United States.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/><ref name=\"puppets\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-puppets.html|title=More Puppets|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=February 7, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=March 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203005913/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-puppets.html|archive-date=December 3, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of the unusual design features of the show is the patterns used on the clothing or players.

These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Chowder'' was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2009, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action ''[[Destroy, Build, Destroy]]'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | title=Tumblr | access-date=November 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103638/http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | archive-date=November 16, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> On his blog, C.H.

Chowder can also regurgitate objects, and he is used as a storage container by the other characters.

Shnitzel is the \"[[straight man]]\" to the other more excitable characters and is frequently agitated.

She is an extreme [[Four Temperaments#choleric|choleric]].

H. Greenblatt): Chowder's pet, who lives in a cage next to his bed. Kimchi is an anthropomorphic flatus (due to the unpleasant odor of [[kimchi]]). He likes things with odors unpleasant for the other characters, and he \"talks\" by making flatulent sounds. Kimchi was first seen in the episode \"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\". Kimchi is usually shown with a blank personality but in \"Stinky Love\" it is shown that he has an opinion.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> What happens to Kimchi in the final episode is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that he still lives with Chowder.\n*'''Gazpacho''' (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]): A [[woolly mammoth]] storekeeper who sells strange [[produce]] and ingredients at the farmer's market. He does his best to offer advice to Chowder when needed. He lives with his overbearing mother, who never appears on screen, but is present at the end of episode \"Gazpacho!\". In \"The Spookiest House in Marzipan\" it is hinted at that Gazpacho has no mother, and that he actually suffers with [[dissociative identity disorder]], but creator Greenblatt says this was merely to \"pay homage to ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''\". Gazpacho shows no interest in moving out and improving his own life. Gazpacho's worst enemies are [[ninja]]s. Greenblatt named him after the cold soup [[gazpacho]]; Greenblatt said that he did not know why, but the name suited the character immediately.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gazpacho closed the stand, and became a nomad. He later pursued his dream and open a Comedy Night Club.\n*'''Panini''' (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): A 12-year-old pink [[cabbit]] who has a crush on Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the feelings and responds with \"I'm not your boyfriend!\" whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. Endive, and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her [[bullying|bully]] Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to [[Angelica Pickles]] from ''[[Rugrats]]''.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|title=Early Endive & Panini Designs|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 15, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054958/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|archive-date=July 14, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not fit in with the rounded shapes in ''Chowder''. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini \"cuter and sweeter\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough to fall in love with females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder \"in a more fun way\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. Panini's name literally means \"sandwiches\" in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans. In the final episode Panini married Chowder, and is currently a mother of 50, she then promised Chowder to stop having more. It\u2019s also likely that she took over Truffles old job.\n*'''Gorgonzola''' (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green [[rat]] apprentice candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder having a better job than him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|title=Gorgonzola|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107091545/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|archive-date=November 7, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since [[blue cheese]] was one of the few foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name \"[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]\" for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green [[opossum]] or a green [[rat]]. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode ''Sniffleball''. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gorgonzola runs a very successful company, most likely involving candle holding.\n*'''Ms. Endive''' (voiced by [[Mindy Sterling]]): An [[obesity|obese]], intelligent, and somewhat snobbish 46-year-old female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This is shown in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\" where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode \"Chowder's Girlfriend\", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fianc\u00e9 did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, \"Chowder's Girlfriend\". The creator describes her as [[Martha Stewart]] with [[Oompa-Loompa]] colors.<ref name=\"endive\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|title=Ms. Endive|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=April 19, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118022158/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|archive-date=November 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt chose to name her after the [[endive]] since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy.<ref name=\"food\"/> Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the final episode, Endive is living a happy life with her Husband, Schnitzel.\n\n===Recurring===\n*'''Kiwi''' (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a [[photorealistic]] pink creature who always gives advice to Chowder and his friends and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. His name is revealed (for the first and only time ever in the show's run) in the episode \"Brain Grub\", where it is known that after Chowder alters the animated universe, Kiwi is reduced to selling used cars.\n*'''Ceviche''' (voiced by Elan Garfias): A young yellow (and somewhat androgynous) [[goat]] apprentice to Pat\u00e9 and Panini's best friend, Ceviche was introduced in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\". He practices aerobic-style dancing and is very charitable and kind to others. Because of his admirable attitude and amazing talents (as well as good looks, as it was shown on one episode that he has a well-sculpted body) he is well-liked.  He is good friends with Panini and will make unwanted advances upon her, which are either refused or unnoticed. Ceviche is also a close friend to Chowder. He has a crush on Panini.  He speaks in a [[wikt:monotone|monotonous]] voice and serves as [[deadpan]] humor for the show.\n*'''Pat\u00e9''' (voiced by John DiMaggio): A tall, well-sculpted [[humanoid]] ballet dance master and operatic singer with a deep voice, grass-green hair, a small black hat, and exaggerated lips who is the mentor of Ceviche. Pat\u00e9 was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show ''Chowder's Girlfriend'' (Episode #1b), where he sings \"I'm Not Your Boyfriend\" on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) in front of an audience. His name, however, was revealed for the first time on ''The Apprentice Games'' (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.\n*'''Chestnut''' (originally voiced by [[Tone L\u014dc]], then [[John DiMaggio]]): Like the food, Chestnut is small and tough. He is a tiny, [[blue]] horned [[devil]]-like creature with a deep, gravelly voice and, to many character's surprise, is physically very strong.  Because of his size, he uses everyday objects as other things (e.g. using a briefcase for a hydrofoil, or a hat as a vacation home). He sings small songs to himself, usually consisting of his catchphrase of \"Dinka-loo, dinka-lee.\" He is teacher of the BLTs, a parody of the [[SAT]]s. He always refers to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] when speaking.\n*'''Reuben''' (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]): A pig who is a [[confidence trick|conman]] and steals from others.\n*'''Mr. Fugu''' (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]): A sentient floating balloon who is said to be Mung's most frequent customer. He is proven to be more greedy than Chowder and never shares any food with him. He is often seen with his valet, Foie Gras, a [[Maneki-neko]] (meows provided by [[George Takei]]) holding Mr. Fugu's string as he cannot control his flotation.\n*'''Sgt. Hoagie''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): He is a [[dog]] who is a police officer in Marzipan City. In ''The Hot Date'', he was going out on a date after several years and asked the other cops for advice.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chowder episodes}}\n{{:List of Chowder episodes}}\nA total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled \"The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend\". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special \"The Apprentice Games\". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with \"The Arborians/The Garage Sale\", and ending with \"A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown\", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with \"The Blast Raz\", and ending with the series finale, entitled \"Chowder Grows Up\", which aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:ChowderPuppets.jpg|thumb|The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal]]\nDuring his time working on Nickelodeon's ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/> Some of the inspiration comes from [[Dr. Seuss]], with other inspiration from [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/><ref name=\"armada\">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |title=Meet the Master Chef&nbsp;\u2013 C.H.

Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on ''Chowder'' before the show made it to air in 2007.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/>\n\n==Production and format==\nEpisodes are produced in seasons which consist of twenty 24-minute episodes.

A similar technique was used in the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' video game series (particularly for the Stan), the Nickelodeon series [[The Off-Beats]], and the [[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|''Mr. Bean'' animated series]].<ref name=\"armada\"/>\n\nThe show is also known for the very wide variety of media used in various episodes. These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Chowder'' was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2009, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action ''[[Destroy, Build, Destroy]]'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | title=Tumblr | access-date=November 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103638/http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | archive-date=November 16, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> On his blog, C.H. Greenblatt expressed relief about having his schedule freed up by the cancellation, saying: \"I didn't really think there'd be this many upsides to having a show officially cancelled by a network, but I'm feeling happier than I've been in a long time. Since we've only got post-production, my schedule finally eases up. I haven't had a break like this in a long, long time... ''Chowder'' has opened up a lot of awesome possibilities for me, and creatively I'm feeling more inspired than ever.\"<ref name=\"blogspot\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/08/hot-girl.html|title=The Hot Girl|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=August 13, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=January 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311091937/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/08/hot-girl.html|archive-date=March 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+''Chowder'' home video releases\n! colspan=3 rowspan=2|Season !! rowspan=2|Episodes !! rowspan=2|Volume !! colspan=2|Release dates !! rowspan=2|Episode(s) include\n|-\n! {{USA}} !! {{THA}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/dvd-releases-from-mvd-in-thailand.5527321 |title=DVD releases from MVD in Thailand |access-date=April 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424214131/http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/dvd-releases-from-mvd-in-thailand.5527321/ |archive-date=April 24, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=5 style=\"background:#1E5994\"| || rowspan=5|[[List of Chowder episodes#Season 1 (2007\u201308)|1]]\n| rowspan=5|2007\u201308 || rowspan=5|20 || rowspan=2|1 || November 4, 2008<ref>{{cite web|asin=B001DSNFQ4|title=Chowder, Vol. 1 (2008)}}</ref> || rowspan=2|November 10, 2010 || rowspan=2|\"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\" / \"Chowder's Girlfriend\" \u2022 \"Grubble Gum\" \u2013 \"The Sing Beans\" \u2022 \"Mahjongg Night\" \u2013 \"The Flibber-Flabber Diet\"\n|-\n| May 6, 2014\n|-\n| 2 || March 3, 2009<ref>{{cite web|asin=B001MEJYBY|title=Chowder, Vol. 2 (2009)}}</ref> || December 15, 2010 || \"Burple Nurples\" / \"Shnitzel Makes a Deposit\" \u2022 \"The Wrong Address\" / \"The Wrong Customer\" \u2022 \"Gazpacho Stands Up\" \u2013 \"Mung on the Rocks\"\n|-\n| 3 || {{n/a}} || January 19, 2010 || \"The Heavy Sleeper\" \u2013 \"The Rat Sandwich\"\n|-\n| 4 || {{n/a}} || February 15, 2011 || \"Chowder Loses His Hat\" \u2013 \"The Apprentice Games\"\n|-\n! rowspan=5 style=\"background:#5C1F99\"| || rowspan=5|[[List of Chowder episodes#Season 2 (2008\u201309)|2]]\n| rowspan=5|2008\u201309 || rowspan=5|20 || 5 || {{n/a}} || March 15, 2011 || \"The Arborians\" \u2013 \"The Catch Phrase\"\n|-\n| 6 || {{n/a}} || April 8, 2011 || \"The Hot Date\" \u2013 \"The Deadly Maze\" \u2022 \"The B.L.T.'s\" \u2013 \"The Dinner Theater\"\n|-\n| 7 || {{n/a}} || May 10, 2011 || \"Kid Shnitzel\" / \"Gazpacho Fights Back\" \u2022 \"Big Ball\" \u2013 \"The Blackout\"\n|-\n| 8 || {{n/a}} || June 14, 2011 || \"The Dice Cycle\" \u2013 \"The Grape Worm\"\n|-\n| rowspan=2|9 || rowspan=2 style=\"background:#ececec;color:#2d2d2d\"|<small>N/A</small> || rowspan=2|July 26, 2011 || rowspan=2| \"A Faire to Remember\" \u2013 \"The Birthday Suits\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background:#991F5C\"| || rowspan=2|[[List of Chowder episodes#Season 3 (2009\u201310)|3]]\n| rowspan=2|2009\u201310 || rowspan=2|9\n|-\n| 10 || {{n/a}} || August 24, 2011 || \"The Heist\" \u2013 \"Chowder Grows Up\"\n|}\nThe entire series has been released in ten [[DVD region code#3|Region 3]] [[pan and scan|fullscreen]] DVD volumes in Thailand from MVD Company Limited.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critics===\nChowder received mostly positive reviews.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.

He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.\u201d (John 1:25,26).'''\n\n\u201cWhoever hears my words and believes in Him who sent me has eternal life. He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God\u201d Job 34:21-22''\n\n''\u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come close to God, and He will come near you.\u201d James 4:7-8''\n\n''\u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16''\n\n'''Let us pray:''' \n\n'''My father in heaven, I am really sorry for the sins in my heart. I want your light to shine into my heart, to remove all the bad things that are ruining my life. Please give me a new heart, and fill my heart with your own presence. Please help me to live a life that will be pleasing to you, and that will help me to be the person I should be. I ask this in the Name of Jesus. AMEN'''\n\n''\u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit\u201d Ps. 32:1-2''\u2003\n", "name_user": "ChristoDorfling", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Book_(All_Nations_Gospel_Publishers)"}
