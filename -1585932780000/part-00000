After receiving suggestions from the forum users, he amended the lyrics, including the incorporation of the phrase \"[[Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times|Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times]]\" ({{zh|t=\u5149\u5fa9\u9999\u6e2f\uff0c\u6642\u4ee3\u9769\u547d|cy=Gw\u014dngfuhk h\u0113ungg\u00f3ng, s\u00echdoih gaakmihng}}), a motto at the protests. The song's music video, comprising scenes from demonstrations, was uploaded to YouTube on 31 August 2019.<ref name=\"originalvideo\"/> The song went viral within a few days across various social media, followed by the emergence of versions in English and [[Glory to Hong Kong#Other languages|other languages]].<ref name=\"time\"/><ref name=\"NYT\"/><ref name=\"scmp\"/> An orchestral music video with [[SATB]] chorus was uploaded to YouTube on 11 September 2019, pulling 1.5 million views within a week.<ref name=\"time\"/><ref name=\"AutoK9-1\"/> Hong Kong protesters previously sung \"[[Do You Hear the People Sing?]]\" and \"[[Sing Hallelujah to the Lord]]\" as protest anthems, before adopting \"Glory to Hong Kong\" as their main anthem.<ref name=NYT />\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, the author-composer said: \"Music is a tool for unity, I really felt like we needed a song to unite us and boost our morale. The message to listeners is that despite the unhappiness and uncertainty of our time, Hong Kong people will not surrender.\"<ref name=time/> In an interview with ''[[Stand News]]'', the composer explained his motivation to compose a new protest song for Hong Kong in place of songs commonly sung during protests such as \"[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]\" and \"Glory Days\", two songs by Hong Kong band [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]], describing the songs as \"not unpleasant to listen to\", but that their rhythm was somewhat out of place with the atmosphere during protests. The composer said he was predominantly a [[pop rock]] artist, noting that a classical-style production like \"Glory to Hong Kong\" was a personal first. Inspired by \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the [[national anthem of Russia]], the \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\" and \"[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria in Excelsis Deo]]\" by [[Antonio Vivaldi]], he spent two months composing the song's melody working backwards from the line \u201cMay people reign, proud and free\u201d.<!-- Can anyone add the exact Cantonese lines corresponding to the reported excerpt? --><ref name=\"interview\" /><ref name=\"Nikkei\">{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Glory-to-Hong-Kong-anthem-born-of-turmoil-turns-into-music-of-hope|title='Glory to Hong Kong': anthem born of turmoil turns into music of hope|last=Smith|first=Ken|date=12 October 2019|website=Nikkei Asian Review|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012080443/https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Glory-to-Hong-Kong-anthem-born-of-turmoil-turns-into-music-of-hope|archive-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song was observed by {{failed verification span|some musical experts|date=January 2020}} to have similar motives to [[Roman Tam]]'s \"[[Below the Lion Rock (song)|Below the Lion Rock]]\",<ref name=\"HarbourTimes\"/>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2020}} a Cantopop song highly regarded among Hong Kongers in association with the sense of [[Lion Rock Spirit|the region's common spirit]].\n\n==Origin of the title==\nThe word \"glory\" ([[wiktionary:\u69ae\u5149|\u69ae\u5149]]) in the song title consists of the Chinese characters for honour ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u69ae|\u69ae]]|j=wing4|labels=no}}) and brilliance ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u5149|\u5149]]|j=gwong1|labels=no}}).<ref name=\"AutoK9-4\"/> The term has been used in poems by [[Li Bai]] and a prose by [[Lu Xun]], in addition to being a common term used by Christians.

He opined that the problem was the definition of \"rioters, whether they were those who abused their power to arrest and beat up people or the powerless force that was attempting to fight back\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hk.lifestyle.appledaily.com/lifestyle/columnist/\u6797\u5915/daily/article/20190916/20768801|script-title=zh:\u85cd\u7d72\u4e8c\u5275\u300a\u69ae\u5149\u300b\u6b4c\u8a5e\u5beb\u5f97\u597d \u2013 \u6797\u5915|website=Apple Daily|language=zh-han|url-status=live|access-date=29 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929064145/https://hk.lifestyle.appledaily.com/lifestyle/columnist/%E6%9E%97%E5%A4%95/daily/article/20190916/20768801/|archive-date=29 September 2019}}</ref> This MV was reuploaded to [[Sina Weibo]] by various Chinese communist official organisations, such as ''[[People's Daily]]'' and the [[Communist Youth League of China|Communist Youth League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weibo.com/3937348351/I6T9p8LE5|script-title=zh:\u613f\u771f\u7406\u6551\u9999\u6e2f\uff01\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5171\u540c\u7684\u5fc3\u58f0|date=14 September 2019|website=\u65b0\u6d6a\u5fae\u535a Sina Weibo|publisher=Communist Youth League China|language=zh-simp|url-status=live|access-date=29 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929064115/https://www.weibo.com/3937348351/I6T9p8LE5|archive-date=29 September 2019}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weibo.com/2803301701/I6SD0DSPE|script-title=zh:\u4e00\u8d77\u8f6c\u53d1\u8fd9\u9996\u6b4c\uff0c\u613f\u771f\u7406\u6551\u9999\u6e2f|date=14 September 2019|website=\u65b0\u6d6a\u5fae\u535a Sina Weibo|agency=\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u62a5 People Daily|language=zh-simp|url-status=live|access-date=29 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929064106/https://www.weibo.com/2803301701/I6SD0DSPE|archive-date=29 September 2019}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 September, the 5th anniversary of the [[Umbrella Movement]], a YouTube channel named \"Channel Me\" uploaded a video titled \"Peace Upon Hong Kong\" (Chinese: \u9858\u5e73\u5b89\u6b78\u9999\u6e2f).

The song's music video, comprising scenes from demonstrations, was uploaded to YouTube on 31 August 2019.<ref name=\"originalvideo\"/> The song went viral within a few days across various social media, followed by the emergence of versions in English and [[Glory to Hong Kong#Other languages|other languages]].<ref name=\"time\"/><ref name=\"NYT\"/><ref name=\"scmp\"/> An orchestral music video with [[SATB]] chorus was uploaded to YouTube on 11 September 2019, pulling 1.5 million views within a week.<ref name=\"time\"/><ref name=\"AutoK9-1\"/> Hong Kong protesters previously sung \"[[Do You Hear the People Sing?]]\" and \"[[Sing Hallelujah to the Lord]]\" as protest anthems, before adopting \"Glory to Hong Kong\" as their main anthem.<ref name=NYT />\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, the author-composer said: \"Music is a tool for unity, I really felt like we needed a song to unite us and boost our morale. The message to listeners is that despite the unhappiness and uncertainty of our time, Hong Kong people will not surrender.\"<ref name=time/> In an interview with ''[[Stand News]]'', the composer explained his motivation to compose a new protest song for Hong Kong in place of songs commonly sung during protests such as \"[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]\" and \"Glory Days\", two songs by Hong Kong band [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]], describing the songs as \"not unpleasant to listen to\", but that their rhythm was somewhat out of place with the atmosphere during protests. The composer said he was predominantly a [[pop rock]] artist, noting that a classical-style production like \"Glory to Hong Kong\" was a personal first. Inspired by \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the [[national anthem of Russia]], the \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\" and \"[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria in Excelsis Deo]]\" by [[Antonio Vivaldi]], he spent two months composing the song's melody working backwards from the line \u201cMay people reign, proud and free\u201d.<!-- Can anyone add the exact Cantonese lines corresponding to the reported excerpt? --><ref name=\"interview\" /><ref name=\"Nikkei\">{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Glory-to-Hong-Kong-anthem-born-of-turmoil-turns-into-music-of-hope|title='Glory to Hong Kong': anthem born of turmoil turns into music of hope|last=Smith|first=Ken|date=12 October 2019|website=Nikkei Asian Review|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012080443/https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Glory-to-Hong-Kong-anthem-born-of-turmoil-turns-into-music-of-hope|archive-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song was observed by {{failed verification span|some musical experts|date=January 2020}} to have similar motives to [[Roman Tam]]'s \"[[Below the Lion Rock (song)|Below the Lion Rock]]\",<ref name=\"HarbourTimes\"/>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2020}} a Cantopop song highly regarded among Hong Kongers in association with the sense of [[Lion Rock Spirit|the region's common spirit]].\n\n==Origin of the title==\nThe word \"glory\" ([[wiktionary:\u69ae\u5149|\u69ae\u5149]]) in the song title consists of the Chinese characters for honour ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u69ae|\u69ae]]|j=wing4|labels=no}}) and brilliance ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:\u5149|\u5149]]|j=gwong1|labels=no}}).<ref name=\"AutoK9-4\"/> The term has been used in poems by [[Li Bai]] and a prose by [[Lu Xun]], in addition to being a common term used by Christians.

Responding to the newspaper's enquiry, Ng Man-yee of RTHK responded that its management has not banned \"Glory to Hong Kong\", has not deleted the song from its database, and as far as she knows, has not discouraged playing the song.<ref>{{cite news |author1=\u6f58\u67cf\u6797 |script-title=zh:\u6e2f\u53f0\u7bc0\u76ee\u7981\u64ad\u300a\u9858\u69ae\u5149\u6b78\u9999\u6e2f\u300b \u54e1\u5de5\u6536\u9ad8\u5c64\u901a\u77e5\u6307\u6b4c\u66f2\u6d89\u300c\u6e2f\u7368\u300d |url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20190915/60045476 |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=Apple Daily |date=15 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924020822/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20190915/60045476 |archive-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLai Rifu, a [[Weiquan]] dissident, was arrested by [[Guangzhou]] police for [[picking quarrels and provoking trouble]] on 16 September.

It stars [[Axel Jodorowsky]], [[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]], Teo Jodorowsky, [[Blanca Guerra]], [[Thelma Tixou]], and [[Guy Stockwell]]. Set in Mexico, the film tells the story of Fenix, a boy who grew up in a [[circus]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with a naked figure sitting in a tree in what looks like a [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental asylum]]. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food and also one of a raw fish. As they try to coax him off of his perch, it is the fish that persuades him to come down. As the nurses get him to put on some overalls, the viewer sees that he has a tattoo of a phoenix on his chest.\n\nWe flash back to Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a \"child magician\" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix adores, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.\n\nConcha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic [[Monsignor]] drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of \"holy blood\" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]], puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.\n\nThe circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the [[Elephant meat|meat]]. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.\n\nLater on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of [[sulphuric acid]] onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.\n\nBack in the present, Fenix is taken out of the asylum to a movie theater along with other patients, most of whom have [[Down syndrome]]. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take [[cocaine]] and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of an unseen woman.\n\nMother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a Japanese [[katana]] sword. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.\n\nAlma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.\n\nAlma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Axel Jodorowsky]] as Fenix\n** [[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]] as young Fenix\n* [[Blanca Guerra]] as Concha\n* [[Guy Stockwell]] as Orgo\n* [[Thelma Tixou]] as The Tattooed Woman\n* Sabrina Dennison as Alma\n** Faviola Elenka Tapia as young Alma\n* Teo Jodorowsky as Pimp\n* Ma.

Argento appreciated the story and even added to it things he thought and together with Leoni they decided to present it to the director who seemed the most suitable to represent it that is Alejandro Jodorowsky. \nAfter his [cult film] ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' of 1974, Jodorowsky was asked to direct a [[film version]] of the [[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s epic 1965 science fiction novel ''[[Dune]]'' but the project had collapsed and except for the children\u2019s fable ''[[Tusk]]'' of 1980 he seemed to have disappeared from the international scenes. But Claudio Argento found him and talked to his agent. Jodorowsky made an appointment in Paris, but he wanted to meet only Leoni because he wanted to meet who wrote the story. Leoni went in Paris and meet Jodorowsky, who wanted to know when exactly he wrote that story. Leoni remembered it was during a certain night and Jodorowsky was disappointed because that night he went to sleep early and the angel of stories passed over Paris to bring him a story, saw that he slept and continued to Rome, saw that Leoni were awake and gave him the story. But the story was his and Leoni was a thief! \nThen, Alejandro developed this story with his imagination and his art, also telling Leoni the story of [[Gregorio C\u00e1rdenas Hern\u00e1ndez]], which in some respects had similar characteristics, and together they wrote the script of ''Santa Sangre''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK3RwKSUcRU&list=PLFNYsCQU-KaMPQX8whHd19K6syiywZxwd&index=1|title=SANTA SANGRE - Roberto Leoni Movie Reviews [Eng sub]|date=November 23, 2019|accessdate= November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\n{{Quote box|quote='One of these patients, who worked with me because he knew 3 or 4 languages so he could help me sort the books, because the library had 50,000 volumes of all types and ages, one day started looking sideways and saying: \"...shut up... shut up...\" The third time I asked him what happened and he answered me calmly with his calm blue eyes: \"No, nothing, I have a voice that tells me to kill you, but don't worry because I love you.\" I was a little uncomfortable, but he reassured me: \"No, no, don't worry, I love you, I don't listen to it...\" Continuing to stare at me with his blue eyes and I was, as far as I could be, calm.

Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.\n\nAlma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Axel Jodorowsky]] as Fenix\n** [[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]] as young Fenix\n* [[Blanca Guerra]] as Concha\n* [[Guy Stockwell]] as Orgo\n* [[Thelma Tixou]] as The Tattooed Woman\n* Sabrina Dennison as Alma\n** Faviola Elenka Tapia as young Alma\n* Teo Jodorowsky as Pimp\n* Ma.

Argento appreciated the story and even added to it things he thought and together with Leoni they decided to present it to the director who seemed the most suitable to represent it that is Alejandro Jodorowsky. \nAfter his [cult film] ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' of 1974, Jodorowsky was asked to direct a [[film version]] of the [[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s epic 1965 science fiction novel ''[[Dune]]'' but the project had collapsed and except for the children\u2019s fable ''[[Tusk]]'' of 1980 he seemed to have disappeared from the international scenes. But Claudio Argento found him and talked to his agent. Jodorowsky made an appointment in Paris, but he wanted to meet only Leoni because he wanted to meet who wrote the story. Leoni went in Paris and meet Jodorowsky, who wanted to know when exactly he wrote that story. Leoni remembered it was during a certain night and Jodorowsky was disappointed because that night he went to sleep early and the angel of stories passed over Paris to bring him a story, saw that he slept and continued to Rome, saw that Leoni were awake and gave him the story. But the story was his and Leoni was a thief! \nThen, Alejandro developed this story with his imagination and his art, also telling Leoni the story of [[Gregorio C\u00e1rdenas Hern\u00e1ndez]], which in some respects had similar characteristics, and together they wrote the script of ''Santa Sangre''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK3RwKSUcRU&list=PLFNYsCQU-KaMPQX8whHd19K6syiywZxwd&index=1|title=SANTA SANGRE - Roberto Leoni Movie Reviews [Eng sub]|date=November 23, 2019|accessdate= November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\n{{Quote box|quote='One of these patients, who worked with me because he knew 3 or 4 languages so he could help me sort the books, because the library had 50,000 volumes of all types and ages, one day started looking sideways and saying: \"...shut up... shut up...\" The third time I asked him what happened and he answered me calmly with his calm blue eyes: \"No, nothing, I have a voice that tells me to kill you, but don't worry because I love you.\" I was a little uncomfortable, but he reassured me: \"No, no, don't worry, I love you, I don't listen to it...\" Continuing to stare at me with his blue eyes and I was, as far as I could be, calm.

Each chapter thus provides the viewer with details which help to explain things which happened in the other chapters.\n\n#'''Rutilio''' deals with Don Ru's dissatisfaction with his marriage and his poorly hidden homosexual love affair with a young man.\n#'''Alma''' deals with Alma's life and her falling in love with Abel. He leaves with Chava for the U.S. and Alma \"disappears\". She has been seduced and ends up in a whorehouse.\n#'''Susanita''' is the landlady with horrible teeth whose feelings and romantic hopes are awakened. She marries Guicho.\n#'''The Return''' describes the return of Abel and Chava, and Abel's search for Alma. Chava is married and has his wife and baby boy with him. Abel finds Alma in the whorehouse and is heartbroken. He tries to attack her pimp and is stabbed several times. He dies in her arms.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1998-08-19/features/9808190058_1_mexican-film-title-pages-homosexual `Midaq Alley' Explores Humanity], August 19, 1998, Deborah Hornblow, ''Hartford Courant''</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz]] as Rutilio (Don Ru)\n* [[Mar\u00eda Rojo]] as Do\u00f1a Cata\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Alma\n* [[Bruno Bichir]] as Abel\n* [[Delia Casanova]] as Eusebia\n* [[Margarita Sanz]] as Susanita\n* [[Claudio Obreg\u00f3n]] as Don Fidel\n* Juan Manuel Bernal as Chava\n* [[Abel Woolrich]] as Zacar\u00edas\n* [[Luis Felipe Tovar]] as G\u00fcicho\n* [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]] as Jos\u00e9 Luis\n* Gina Morett as Do\u00f1a Flor\n* \u00d3scar Yoldi as Ubaldo ''El Poeta'' (\"The poet\")\n* Esteban Soberanes as Jimy\n* Eugenia Le\u00f1ero as Tina\n* Tiar\u00e9 Scanda as Maru\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===[[Ariel Awards]]===\nWon:\n* ''Best Film''\n* ''Best Direction'' for [[Jorge Fons]]\n* ''Best Actress'' for Margarita Sanz\n* ''Best Supporting Actor'' for [[Luis Felipe Tovar]]\n* ''Best Costume Design'' for Jaime Ortiz\n* ''Best Editing'' for Carlos Savage hijo\n* ''Best Make-Up'' for Elvia Romero\n* ''Best Original Music Theme or Song'' for Luc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez\n* ''Best Original Score'' for Luc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez\n* ''Best Production Design'' for [[Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez (designer)|Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez]]\n* ''Best Screenplay'' for [[Vicente Le\u00f1ero]]\n\nNominations:\n* ''Best Actor'' for [[Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz]]\n* ''Best Actor in a Minor Role'' for \u00d3scar Yoldi\n* ''Best Actress'' for [[Salma Hayek]]\n* ''Best Actress in a Minor Role'' for Delia Casanova\n* ''Best Actress in a Minor Role'' for [[Mar\u00eda Rojo]]\n* ''Best Cinematography''  for Carlos Marcovich\n* ''Best Set Design '' for [[Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez (designer)|Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez]]\n* ''Best Sound'' for David Baksht\n* ''Best Supporting Actor'' for Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho\n* ''Best Supporting Actor'' for Esteban Soberanes\n* ''Best Supporting Actress '' for Tiar\u00e9 Scanda\n\n===[[45th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Special Mention'' for the exceptional narrative quality<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1995/03_preistr_ger_1995/03_Preistraeger_1995.html |title=Berlinale: 1995 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-12-31 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\nNominations:\n* ''Golden Bear'' for Jorge Fons\n\n=== [[Chicago International Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Audience Choice Award\"\n\n=== [[Goya Award]]===\nWins:\n* ''Best Spanish Language Foreign Film''\n\n=== [[Gramado Film Festival]] ===\nWins:\n* ''Best Director'' for [[Jorge Fons]]\n* ''Best Supporting Actress'' for Margarita Sanz\n\nNominations:\n* ''Best Latin Film''\n\n=== [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Audience Award''\n\n=== [[Havana Film Festival]] ===\nWins:\n* ''Best Director'' for [[Jorge Fons]]\n* ''Best Screenplay'' for [[Vicente Le\u00f1ero]]\n* ''Grand Coral'' (First prize) for Jorge Fons\n\n=== [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican Cinema Journalists]]===\nWins:\n* ''Best Film''\n\n=== [[Paraguay|Paraguay Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Best Actress'' for Margarita Sanz\n* ''Best Actor'' for [[Bruno Bichir]]\n\n=== [[Latin America|Toulouse Latin America Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Special Mention'' for the distribution of the film\n\n=== [[Valladolid International Film Festival]]===\nWins:\n* ''Best Actor'' for [[Bruno Bichir]]\n* ''Silver Spike'' for [[Jorge Fons]]\n\nNominations:\n* ''Golden Spike'' for [[Jorge Fons]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 68th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Mexican submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0112619|El Callej\u00f3n de los Milagros}}\n* {{amg movie|134851|El Callej\u00f3n de los Milagros}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|midaq-alley}}\n* [https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800326198/info ''El Callej\u00f3n de los Milagros''] at [[Yahoo|Yahoo!
