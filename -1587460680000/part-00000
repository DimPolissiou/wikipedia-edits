{"title_page": "List of attacks related to secondary schools", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of attacks related to secondary schools''' that have occurred around the world. These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

Because the Russian-made Kornet is an accurate, laser-guided weapon, it appeared that the bus was intentionally targeted. The attackers were never apprehended.

Israel said the yellow color of the bus made it easily identifiable and accused Hamas of \"crossing a line. The missile hit the bus after all but one of the children had been dropped off.

The station's transmitter is located in [[Newnan, Georgia]] and targets [[metro Atlanta]], also covering its [[city of license]] of [[Bowdon, Georgia]].  It is owned by [[iHeartMedia]] and operates from studios located at the Peachtree Palisades building in the [[Brookwood Hills]] district of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1994-2004)===\nThe station began in May 1994 as [[country music|country-music]] \"Y 105.5\" '''WYAI-FM''', a [[list of broadcast station classes|class-A]] serving [[Carrollton, Georgia|Carrollton]] to the west-southwest of metro Atlanta.  Having [[co-channel]] [[RF interference]] with station WCHK-FM 105.5 in [[Canton, Georgia]] (north-northwest of Atlanta), both stations changed [[radio frequencies]] (the other station now being [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]] 105.7) and moved closer to Atlanta.  In late February 2002, the station upgraded to a class C1 as an Atlanta move-in. To create hype, the station stunted with [[classical music]] and comedy bits. 105.3 officially debuted as '''WMAX-FM''' \"'''105.3 The Max'''\", playing all [[1980s in music|80s music]], on February 18, 2002, with \"[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]\" by [[The Buggles]] being the first song played.<ref>http://formatchange.com/105-3-the-max-moves-in/</ref> On January 30, 2004, at 6 p.m., after playing \"[[It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)|It's The End of the World]]\" by [[R.E.M.]], it became a [[hot talk]] station known as \"'''Real Radio 105.3'''\" that aired [[talk radio|talk]] on [[weekday]]s and '80s music on [[weekend]]s.<ref>http://formatchange.com/wmax-becomes-real-radio-105-3/</ref>  The [[WMAX-FM]] [[callsign (radio)|callsign]] now resides on another [[iHeartMedia]] station in [[Holland, Michigan]], which is currently branded as '''9-6-1 ESPN'''.\n\n===Viva to 105.3 The Buzz (2004-2006)===\nOn September 15, 2004, at 10 a.m., following \"The MJ Morning Show\", the station began stunting with a heartbeat sound effect and Spanish-language liners promoting the upcoming launch of the new format.<ref>[https://formatchange.com/wmax-becomes-viva-105-3/ WMAX Becomes \"Viva 105.3\"]</ref> At 11 p.m. that evening, the station changed to [[Latin Pop|Latin Top 40]] as '''WWVA-FM''' \"'''Viva 105.3'''\", as part of efforts by owner iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel Communications) to expand into [[Hispanic]] [[radio market]]s. During the last quarter of 2004, it was the second-top-[[listenership|rated]] radio station in Atlanta.\n\nOn May 5, 2005, [[WRDA|WWVA]] would begin simulcasting on 105.7 FM, displacing [[oldies]]-formatted \"Cool 105.7\", as part of a frequency and format shuffle. After four days of simulcasting and a brief stunt of a loop directing listeners to the new frequency, WBZY's [[alternative rock]] format would move from 96.7 to 105.3 as \"105.3 the Buzz\" (\"Viva\" would then also begin simulcasting on 96.7 FM on May 17, also after a brief simulcasting period). For two weeks, the calls of 105.3 were changed to '''WLCL''', so the local media wouldn't be able to predict the move. After the switch, the calls were changed to '''WBZY'''.\n\n===The Buzz to El Patr\u00f3n (2006-2018)===\nOn November 17, 2006, at 9 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], The Buzz ceased operations. Some of the on-air staff were fired and others moved down the dial to [[sister station]] [[WWPW|WKLS]] FM 96.1, which was changed from \"96 Rock\" to \"Project 9-6-1\".  For several days, WBZY-FM [[simulcast]]ed the new station until it began a loop telling listeners to tune into the new station, as well as advertising the new [[radio format|format]] of the station. The 105.3 frequency debuted a new [[Regional Mexican]] format under the name ''El Patr\u00f3n'' on November 26 at 9 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]].\n\nOn October 19, 2009, sister station [[WRDA (FM)|WWVA-FM]] (then known as Viva 105.7), who had been broadcasting a Spanish AC format, flipped to [[Rhythmic AC]] as \"Groove 105.7\", thus leaving WBZY as Atlanta's only FM Spanish-language station.  This move prompted Clear Channel to merge 105.7's Spanish [[adult contemporary]] format with 105.3's regional Mexican format. The \"Viva\" format has moved to El Patr\u00f3n's HD-2 channel.\n\n===WBZY-HD2 as Mia from iHeartRadio (2013-present)===\nNear the end of September 2013, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]]\u2019s [[iHeartRadio]] online, commercial-free [[Latin Pop|Spanish Contemporary Hit Music]] formatted station known as ''Mia'', began broadcasting on WBZY-[[HD Radio|HD]]2. Previously, Mia was an online-only station on iHeartRadio with no local origin. However, with its beginning on WBZY-HD2, it began to identify itself as \"WBZY-HD2, Bowdon, Georgia\" at the top of every hour, even when listened to on iHeartRadio. [[Radio personality|Radio personalities]] on Mia originate from other iHeartMedia-owned stations like Humberto \"El Gato\" Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n from [[WZTU]] in [[Miami]] and Paula Andrea from WBZY itself.\n\n===Z105.3/105.3 La Z (2018-Present)===\nAt 5 p.m. on November 8, 2018, WBZY flipped to Spanish CHR, branded as \"Z105.3\".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/171881/el-patron-gives-way-to-z105-3-atlanta/ El Patr\u00f3n Gives Way to Z105.3 Atlanta] Radioinsight - November 8, 2018</ref> In July of the following year, the branding changed slightly to \"105.3 La Z\". In 2020 they reverted to the \"Z105.3\" branding. On April 20, 2020, sister station WRDA began simulcasting WBZY\u2019s format on a temporary basis, as WRDA will become the primary station with WBZY being prepared for a possible format flip. <ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/186242/alt-105-7-atlanta-gives-way-to-spanish-chr-z105-7/ \u201cAlt 105.7 Atlanta Gives Way To Spanish CHR Z105.7\u201d] from Radio Insight (April 2020)</ref><ref>[https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/alt-105-off-the-dial-signal-now-simulcasting-latin-hits-z105/La9NYv37jmPpi6ypaxWTrL/ Alt 105.7 is off the FM dial, signal now simulcasting Latin hits Z105.3- Atlanta Journal Constitution] April 20, 2020</ref>\n\n==WBZY-HD==\n*WBZY-HD1 \"Z105.3\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]])\n*WBZY-HD2 \"Mia\" ([[Latin Pop|Latin Top 40]])\n\n==Previous logo==\n[[File:WBZY 105.3FMElPatron logo.png|200px]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://z1057atlanta.iheart.com/ Z105.3 website]\n*{{FM station data|WBZY}}\n\n{{Atlanta radio}}\n{{Spanish Radio Stations in Georgia}}\n{{IHeartMedia}}\n\n{{coord|33.412|N|84.830|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Spanish-language radio stations in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Georgia (U.S. state)|BZY]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1994]]\n[[Category:1994 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:IHeartMedia radio stations]]\n[[Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of radio stations in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n*[[Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n*[[Lists of radio stations in North and Central America|List of radio stations in North and Central America]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Regional Mexican radio station in Bowdon\u2013Atlanta, Georgia}}\n{{about||station located in Peachtree City, Georgia formerly known as WBZY|WRDG|station located in New Castle, Pennsylvania formerly known as WBZY|WUZZ (AM)}}\n\n{{Infobox radio station\n| image              = Z 1053 Atl.png\n| image_size         = 198px\n| name               = WBZY\n| city               = [[Bowdon, Georgia]]\n| area               = [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]<br>Midwest Georgia\n| branding           = ''Z105.3''\n| slogan             = Tu Estaci\u00f3n Para Super Hits!\n| frequency          = 105.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]] {{HD Radio}}<br>105.3 [[HD Radio|HD]]-2 [http://www.iheart.com/live/MIA-4451/ Mia]\n| airdate            = {{start date and age|1994|5}} (as WYAI at 105.5)\n| format             = [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] (Relays 105.7 FM [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]], Canton)\n| language           = [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n| erp                = 61,000 [[watt]]s\n| haat               = {{convert|367|meters}}\n| class              = C1\n| facility_id        = 63406\n| callsign_meaning   = '''W''' '''B'''uz'''Z''' '''Y''' (former branding)\n| former_callsigns   = WYAI (1994\u20132002)<br>WMAX-FM (2002\u20132004)<br>WWVA-FM (2004\u20132005)<br>WLCL (2005)\n| former_frequencies = 105.5 MHz (1994\u20132002)\n| owner              = [[iHeartMedia]]\n| licensee           = iHM Licenses, LLC\n| sister_stations    = [[WGST]], [[WWPW]], [[WRDG]], [[WUBL]], [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]]\n| webcast            = [https://www.iheart.com/live/z-1057-749/ Listen Live]<br>HD2: [https://www.iheart.com/live/rumba-4451/ Listen Live]\n| website            = [https://z1057atlanta.iheart.com/ Z105.3 Online] \n}}\n\n'''WBZY''' (105.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], \"'''Z105.3'''\") is a radio station that plays [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] music.

Some of the on-air staff were fired and others moved down the dial to [[sister station]] [[WWPW|WKLS]] FM 96.1, which was changed from \"96 Rock\" to \"Project 9-6-1\".  For several days, WBZY-FM [[simulcast]]ed the new station until it began a loop telling listeners to tune into the new station, as well as advertising the new [[radio format|format]] of the station. The 105.3 frequency debuted a new [[Regional Mexican]] format under the name ''El Patr\u00f3n'' on November 26 at 9 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]].\n\nOn October 19, 2009, sister station [[WRDA (FM)|WWVA-FM]] (then known as Viva 105.7), who had been broadcasting a Spanish AC format, flipped to [[Rhythmic AC]] as \"Groove 105.7\", thus leaving WBZY as Atlanta's only FM Spanish-language station.  This move prompted Clear Channel to merge 105.7's Spanish [[adult contemporary]] format with 105.3's regional Mexican format. The \"Viva\" format has moved to El Patr\u00f3n's HD-2 channel.\n\n===WBZY-HD2 as Mia from iHeartRadio (2013-present)===\nNear the end of September 2013, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]]\u2019s [[iHeartRadio]] online, commercial-free [[Latin Pop|Spanish Contemporary Hit Music]] formatted station known as ''Mia'', began broadcasting on WBZY-[[HD Radio|HD]]2. Previously, Mia was an online-only station on iHeartRadio with no local origin. However, with its beginning on WBZY-HD2, it began to identify itself as \"WBZY-HD2, Bowdon, Georgia\" at the top of every hour, even when listened to on iHeartRadio. [[Radio personality|Radio personalities]] on Mia originate from other iHeartMedia-owned stations like Humberto \"El Gato\" Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n from [[WZTU]] in [[Miami]] and Paula Andrea from WBZY itself.\n\n===Z105.3/105.3 La Z (2018-Present)===\nAt 5 p.m. on November 8, 2018, WBZY flipped to Spanish CHR, branded as \"Z105.3\".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/171881/el-patron-gives-way-to-z105-3-atlanta/ El Patr\u00f3n Gives Way to Z105.3 Atlanta] Radioinsight - November 8, 2018</ref> In July of the following year, the branding changed slightly to \"105.3 La Z\".

Succeeding [[Samsung Experience|Samsung Experience UX]] and [[TouchWiz]], it is designed to make using larger [[Smartphone]]s easier and become more visually appealing. To provide more clarity, some elements of the UI are tweaked to match the colours that are based on the colour of the user's phone. It was unveiled at Samsung's developer conference in 2018 alongside the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10 series]], [[Samsung Gear#Samsung Galaxy Buds (2019)|Galaxy Buds]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold|Galaxy Fold]], and first introduced as part of Samsung's firmware updates for [[Android Pie|Android 9 Pie]].\n\n== Features ==\nOne UI was designed as part of a goal to make Samsung's hardware and software \"work together in perfect harmony\" and provide a more \"natural\" experience on large-screen smartphones. A prominent design pattern in many of Samsung's system applications is to intentionally place common features and user interface elements along the middle of the screen rather than near the top. This makes them easier to reach with a user's [[thumb]] when using the device one-handed. For similar reasons, apps utilise large headers to push their main content towards the vertical centre of the screen. The navigation bar supports the use of gestures and the usual 3-button system, while a system-wide \"night mode\" was also added (which gives UI elements and supported applications a darkened color scheme). As with Android Pie upstream, the Overview screen of recent apps uses a horizontal layout, as opposed to the vertical layout of previous versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-one-ui-which-will-power-the-galaxy-s10-debuts-on-the-galaxy-s9/|title=Samsung's One UI, which will power the Galaxy S10, makes US debut on the Galaxy S9|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3340826/android/samsung-one-ui-android.html|title=Galaxy S10 preview: One UI is the clean break from Android Samsung has always wanted|date=2019-02-19|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229339/samsung-one-ui-update-android-9-pie-galaxy-s10-plus-s10e|title=Samsung\u2019s One UI is the best software it\u2019s ever put on a smartphone|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2019-02-19|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-redesigns-its-smartphone-user-interface-with-one-ui/|title=Samsung redesigns its smartphone user interface with One samsung UI|last=Tibken|first=Shara|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Version history ==\nOne UI 1.0, the first version of One UI, brought about many features which were becoming increasingly popular among various apps and iOS. First and foremost, dark mode was added to make viewing in dark spaces easier on your eyes. This feature was included in many apps and eventually brought to [[iOS 13]] and [[Android 10]]. The first version also brought native screenshot editing tools, refined curves, refinements to the Always-On Display (tap to show), an upgraded Bixby with support for remapping the Bixby button, and a new way to navigate the device: gestures. While Android 9 Pie did come with gesture support, it was only available on Pixel devices and stock AOSP devices and is said to be 'half baked' by many users. However, Samsung decided to create their own gesture system to navigate devices with OneUI installed. All you had to do was swipe up from the bottom of the device in the three locations of the 'buttons' to navigate. There have been many mixed reviews of this system, but is by far one of the better ones of the trend.\n\nOne UI 1.1, a minor update for OneUI, brought a few camera, fingerprint, and facial recognition stability fixes and performance optimizations. It also includes new digital wellbeing mode. This update has not yet reached the Galaxy S8, Note8, S9, and Note9 range, but was an OTA update for the Galaxy S10 series devices. It launched with the 2019 Galaxy A series devices, such as the A30, A50 and A70.\n\nOne UI 1.5, another minor update, was primarily for Galaxy Smart Watches, however, does provide native Link to Windows support. It launched with the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10|Galaxy Note10 series]] devices.\n\nOne UI 2.0, the second generation update to One UI, provides Galaxy users with a skinned Digital Wellbeing experience, a more refined UI in some default apps such as Device Care, a minor UI change to the clock position in quick settings, a native screen recorder, the new Android 10 gesture system, Dynamic Lock Screen (different wallpaper with every unlock), a Trash folder in Files, native Android Auto, and harder Location permission access. OneUI 2.0 has already rolled out to current devices (Galaxy S10, Note10) and is still in Beta for others (Galaxy S9, Note9).\n\n== Release ==\nOne UI 1.0 based on Android 9 Pie was periodically released to the Galaxy S8, Note8, S9, and Note9 devices throughout January, February, March and April 2019. Newer Galaxy A and M devices also have the new Samsung skin as does the Note FE (Fan Edition). One UI 1.1 was released alongside the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10 series]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold|Galaxy Fold]].\n\nOne UI 1.5 was pre-installed on the Galaxy Note10 devices after Samsung's partnership with Microsoft to bring better mobile integration to Windows 10. While the Galaxy S7 series and Note 5 devices did not officially receive the update from Samsung, many developers in the Open Source community have ported the system to these devices and many more.\n\nOne UI 2.0 is stable for the S10, Note 10, S9 and Note 9 devices.\n\n== Devices running One UI ==\nNote that this list is not exhaustive.\n\n=== Smartphones ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Succeeding [[Samsung Experience|Samsung Experience UX]] and [[TouchWiz]], it is designed to make using larger [[Smartphone]]s easier and become more visually appealing. To provide more clarity, some elements of the UI are tweaked to match the colours that are based on the colour of the user's phone. It was unveiled at Samsung's developer conference in 2018 alongside the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10 series]], [[Samsung Gear#Samsung Galaxy Buds (2019)|Galaxy Buds]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold|Galaxy Fold]], and first introduced as part of Samsung's firmware updates for [[Android Pie|Android 9 Pie]].\n\n== Features ==\nOne UI was designed as part of a goal to make Samsung's hardware and software \"work together in perfect harmony\" and provide a more \"natural\" experience on large-screen smartphones. A prominent design pattern in many of Samsung's system applications is to intentionally place common features and user interface elements along the middle of the screen rather than near the top. This makes them easier to reach with a user's [[thumb]] when using the device one-handed. For similar reasons, apps utilise large headers to push their main content towards the vertical centre of the screen. The navigation bar supports the use of gestures and the usual 3-button system, while a system-wide \"night mode\" was also added (which gives UI elements and supported applications a darkened color scheme). As with Android Pie upstream, the Overview screen of recent apps uses a horizontal layout, as opposed to the vertical layout of previous versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-one-ui-which-will-power-the-galaxy-s10-debuts-on-the-galaxy-s9/|title=Samsung's One UI, which will power the Galaxy S10, makes US debut on the Galaxy S9|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3340826/android/samsung-one-ui-android.html|title=Galaxy S10 preview: One UI is the clean break from Android Samsung has always wanted|date=2019-02-19|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229339/samsung-one-ui-update-android-9-pie-galaxy-s10-plus-s10e|title=Samsung\u2019s One UI is the best software it\u2019s ever put on a smartphone|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2019-02-19|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-redesigns-its-smartphone-user-interface-with-one-ui/|title=Samsung redesigns its smartphone user interface with One samsung UI|last=Tibken|first=Shara|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Version history ==\nOne UI 1.0, the first version of One UI, brought about many features which were becoming increasingly popular among various apps and iOS. First and foremost, dark mode was added to make viewing in dark spaces easier on your eyes. This feature was included in many apps and eventually brought to [[iOS 13]] and [[Android 10]]. The first version also brought native screenshot editing tools, refined curves, refinements to the Always-On Display (tap to show), an upgraded Bixby with support for remapping the Bixby button, and a new way to navigate the device: gestures. While Android 9 Pie did come with gesture support, it was only available on Pixel devices and stock AOSP devices and is said to be 'half baked' by many users. However, Samsung decided to create their own gesture system to navigate devices with OneUI installed. All you had to do was swipe up from the bottom of the device in the three locations of the 'buttons' to navigate. There have been many mixed reviews of this system, but is by far one of the better ones of the trend.\n\nOne UI 1.1, a minor update for OneUI, brought a few camera, fingerprint, and facial recognition stability fixes and performance optimizations. This update has not yet reached the Galaxy S8, Note8, S9, and Note9 range, but was an OTA update for the Galaxy S10 series devices. It launched with the 2019 Galaxy A series devices, such as the A30, A50 and A70.\n\nOne UI 1.5, another minor update, was primarily for Galaxy Smart Watches, however, does provide native Link to Windows support. It launched with the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10|Galaxy Note10 series]] devices.\n\nOne UI 2.0, the second generation update to One UI, provides Galaxy users with a skinned Digital Wellbeing experience, a more refined UI in some default apps such as Device Care, a minor UI change to the clock position in quick settings, a native screen recorder, the new Android 10 gesture system, Dynamic Lock Screen (different wallpaper with every unlock), a Trash folder in Files, native Android Auto, and harder Location permission access. OneUI 2.0 has already rolled out to current devices (Galaxy S10, Note10) and is still in Beta for others (Galaxy S9, Note9).\n\n== Release ==\nOne UI 1.0 based on Android 9 Pie was periodically released to the Galaxy S8, Note8, S9, and Note9 devices throughout January, February, March and April 2019. Newer Galaxy A and M devices also have the new Samsung skin as does the Note FE (Fan Edition). One UI 1.1 was released alongside the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10 series]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold|Galaxy Fold]].\n\nOne UI 1.5 was pre-installed on the Galaxy Note10 devices after Samsung's partnership with Microsoft to bring better mobile integration to Windows 10. While the Galaxy S7 series and Note 5 devices did not officially receive the update from Samsung, many developers in the Open Source community have ported the system to these devices and many more.\n\nOne UI 2.0 is stable for the S10, Note 10, S9 and Note 9 devices.\n\n== Devices running One UI ==\nNote that this list is not exhaustive.\n\n=== Smartphones ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
