Harris Chapel, built in 1892, is the oldest building on the campus]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe school was founded in 1886 by [[Artemas Lester]], a [[Circuit rider (Religious)|circuit-riding]] Methodist minister who wanted to provide the residents of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] with an education. The college was funded in part by production from an agricultural program, or college farm. Students who could not afford education were allowed to work on the farm to earn tuition.\n\nOriginally known as '''McTyeire Institute''' for the small village where the school was located, the college struggled for the first year until an [[Athens, Georgia]], judge, [[Young Harris|Young L.G. Harris]], donated enough money to keep the school open. The school was later renamed '''Young Harris Institute''' and became Young Harris College in honor of its benefactor, as was the [[Young Harris, Georgia|surrounding town]] in 1895.<ref name=\"NEW\" /> A fire destroyed the college's main classroom building in 1911, but it was rebuilt by local townspeople and named Sharp Hall in honor of the college president at the time. The ''Young Harris Academy'' was founded in the late 19th century and provided a [[primary education]] for thousands of students until it closed after [[World War II]].<ref name=HIST>[http://www.yhc.edu/pages/yhc.php?id=1208 \"A History of YHC\"] Young Harris College website</ref>\n\n===Bequest===\nMargaret Adger Pitts, who died in 1998, left an estate valued at $192 million, mostly in [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] stock acquired by her father in the 1920s.

Harris Chapel, built in 1892, is the oldest building on the campus]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe school was founded in 1886 by [[Artemas Lester]], a [[Circuit rider (Religious)|circuit-riding]] Methodist minister who wanted to provide the residents of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] with an education. The college was funded in part by production from an agricultural program, or college farm. Students who could not afford education were allowed to work on the farm to earn tuition.\n\nOriginally known as '''McTyeire Institute''' for the small village where the school was located, the college struggled for the first year until an [[Athens, Georgia]], judge, [[Young Harris|Young L.G. Harris]], donated enough money to keep the school open. The school was later renamed '''Young Harris Institute''' and became Young Harris College in honor of its benefactor, as was the [[Young Harris, Georgia|surrounding town]] in 1895.<ref name=\"NEW\" /> A fire destroyed the college's main classroom building in 1911, but it was rebuilt by local townspeople and named Sharp Hall in honor of the college president at the time. The ''Young Harris Academy'' was founded in the late 19th century and provided a [[primary education]] for thousands of students until it closed after [[World War II]].<ref name=HIST>[http://www.yhc.edu/pages/yhc.php?id=1208 \"A History of YHC\"] Young Harris College website</ref>\n\n===Bequest===\nMargaret Adger Pitts, who died in 1998, left an estate valued at $192 million, mostly in [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] stock acquired by her father in the 1920s.

In 2008, the college earned its four-year accreditation through regional accreditation organization, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and was approved to offer [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] degrees in biology, business and public policy, English, and music. In February 2010, Young Harris' accreditation was expanded to include communication studies, history, outdoor leadership, theatre, and musical theatre in the list of sanctioned bachelor's programs.<ref name=BAC>[http://www.sgaumc.com/news/detail/138 \"Young Harris College Adds Five New Baccalaureate Programs\"], South Georgia Conference of UMC news release, accessed March 15, 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Sharp Hall, Young Harris College, Young Harris (Towns County, Georgia).JPG|thumb|200 px|Sharp Hall, built in 1912, has the Office of the President, Myers Student Center, and YHC Bookstore]]\nYoung Harris College serves a student body population of over 1,100 students, with approximately 100 from the surrounding area.

Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control and he reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the Kuomintang under the control of Du Yuesheng.
