She published more than a dozen collections of poetry during her lifetime and 13 novels. She was twice awarded the [[Hawthornden Prize|Hawthornden Prize for Imaginative Literature]]: in 1927 for her pastoral epic, ''The Land'', and in 1933 for her ''Collected Poems''. She was the inspiration for the androgynous protagonist of ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', by her famous friend and lover, [[Virginia Woolf]].\n \nShe had a longstanding column in ''[[The Observer]]'' (1946\u20131961) and is remembered for the celebrated garden at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst]] created with her husband, Sir [[Harold Nicolson]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Antecedents===\n[[File:Victoria Josepha Sackville-West.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville|Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville]].

She didn't befriend local children and found it hard to make friends at school. Her biographers characterise her childhood as one filled by loneliness and isolation. She wrote prolifically at Knole, penning eight full-length (unpublished) novels between 1906\u20131910, ballads, and many plays, some in French. Her lack of formal education led to later shyness with her peers, such as those in the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. She felt herself to be sluggish of mind and she was never at the intellectual heart of her social group.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) pXiii</ref><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp1-2</ref><ref>Rose, Norman,''Harold Nicolson'' Random House, 2014, pxxx</ref>\n[[File:Vita in childhood.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Vita in Childhood]]\n\nVita's apparently Roma lineage introduced a passion for 'gypsy' ways, a culture she perceived to be hot-blooded, heart-led, dark and romantic. It informed the stormy nature of many of Vita's later love affairs and was a strong theme in her writing. She visited Roma camps and felt herself to be at one with them.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\nVita's mother had a wide array of famous lovers, including financier [[J. P. Morgan]] and Sir John Murray Scott (from 1897 until his death in 1912). Scott, secretary to the couple who inherited and developed the [[Wallace Collection]], was a devoted companion and Lady Sackville and he were rarely apart during their years together. During her childhood, Vita spent a great deal of time in Scott's apartments in Paris, perfecting her already fluent French.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\n===First loves===\nVita [[Debutante#United Kingdom|debuted]] in 1910, shortly after the death of King [[Edward VII]].

After the wedding the couple lived in [[Cihangir]], a suburb of [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul), the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, but the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her. It was only during this time that she attempted to don, with good grace, the part of a \"correct and adoring wife of the brilliant young diplomat\", as she sarcastically wrote.<ref name=\"dennison\"/>{{rp|97}}<ref name=\"dennison\"/>{{rp|95}} When she became pregnant, in the summer of 1914, the couple returned to England to ensure that she could give birth in a British hospital.\n\nThe family lived at 182 [[Ebury Street]], [[Belgravia]]<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/nicolson-harold-1886-1968 182 Ebury St], Blue Plaque, English Heritage]</ref> and bought [[Long Barn]] in Kent as a country house (1915\u20131930).

Vita often dressed as a man, styled as Keppel's husband.  The two women made a bond to remain faithful to one another, pledging that neither would engage in sexual relations with their husband. {{efn|In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Keppel, Sackville-West wrote: I never ought to have married you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you for as long as you wanted me ... I ought never to have married til I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me ... Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young.

In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote that she felt very low, entertaining thoughts of suicide, believing that Nicolson would be better off without her.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In 1920 the lovers ran off again to France together and their husbands chased after them in a small two-seater aeroplane.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p4\"/> Sackville-West heard allegations that Keppel and her husband Trefusis had been involved sexually, and she broke off the relationship as the lesbian oath of fidelity had been broken.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Despite the rift, the two women stayed devoted to one another.\n\n===Persia===\nFrom 1925 to 1927, Nicolson lived in [[Tehran]] where Sackville-West often visited him.

She told Woolf in one letter: \"I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|202}} Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to write quickly, she was inclined to believe that the volumes were written too much in haste: \"Vita's prose is too fluent\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|202}} {{efn|Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, wrote to Woolf: \"I shall work so hard [on the next book], partly to please you and partly to please myself ...

Sackville-West's support gave Woolf greater confidence and helped her cast off her self-image of a sickly semi-recluse. She persuaded Woolf that her nervous ailments had been misdiagnosed, and that she should focus on her own varied intellectual projects; that she must learn to rest. {{efn|In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: \"Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people?

''The Edwardians'', published next, sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. The boost helped Hogarth financially, though Woolf did not always value the books' romantic themes. The increased security of the Press's fortunes allowed Woolf to write more experimental novels such as ''[[The Waves]]''<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|201}} Though contemporary critics consider Woolf a better writer, critics in the 1920s viewed Sackville-West as more accomplished, with her books outselling Woolf's by a large margin.<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66\u201367}} {{efn|The extent to which Hogarth depended upon Sackville-West to stay in business was reflected in a letter Woolf sent her on 7 September 1930 saying: \"What about your novel and your poems?

These trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel ''To the Lighthouse'', noteworthy for its theme of longing for someone absent, was partly inspired by Sackville-West's frequent absences. Sackville-West inspired Woolf to write one of her most famous novels, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries.

Nicolson provided the architectural structure, with strong classical lines, which would frame his wife's innovative informal planting schemes. She created a new and experimental system of enclosures or rooms, such as the White Garden, Rose Garden, Orchard, Cottage Garden and Nuttery. She also innovated single colour-themed gardens and design principles orientating the visitors' experience to discovery and exploration. Her first garden at [[Long Barn]] (Kent, 1915\u20131930) was experimental, a place of learning by trial and error and she carried over her ideas and projects to Sissinghurst, utilising her hard won experience.<ref name=\"GBG\"/> Sissinghurst was first opened to the public in 1938.\n\n[[File:Sissinghurst_Gardens_1_(4907255329).jpg|thumb|Sissinghurst]]\nSackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break as she needed money to pay for Sissinghurst.

In it she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson and why she had fallen in love with Violet Keppel. The work, titled ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', was not published until 1973.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In the book she uses metaphors from nature to present her account as truthful and honest, describing her life as a \"bog\" and a \"swamp\", suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality. She wrote that in the future \"it will be recognized that many more people of my type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nReflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Keppel as both \"deviant\" and \"natural\", as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Georgia Johnston has argued that Sackville-West's confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Keppel while at same time declaring her \"shame\" about this \"duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> At various times, Sackville-West called herself a \"pariah\" with a \"perverted nature\" and \"unnatural\" feelings for Keppel, who was portrayed as a tempting, if degrading, object of her desire.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West called for a \"spirit of candor\" in society that would allow for tolerance of gay and bisexual people.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], Sackville-West sometimes wrote of her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but failed to live up to.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nSeveral times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote ''Portrait of a Marriage'' for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a \"scientific\" approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|127\u2013128}} Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared \"she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128\u2013129}} Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nIn 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published ''Portrait of a Marriage'', he was uncertain if he was going to be charged with obscenity, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|130\u2013131}} Despite portraying herself as in some way \"deviant\" because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in ''Portrait of a Marriage'' of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous \"liberation of half my personality\", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with \"deviant\" sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her \"perverted\" sexuality.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}} Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Keppel as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing \"even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self.\"<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}}\n\nThe memoir was [[Portrait of a Marriage (TV series)|dramatised by the BBC]] (and [[PBS]] in North America) in 1990, starring [[Janet McTeer]] as Vita, and [[Cathryn Harrison]] as Violet. The series won four [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]].<ref>[https://variety.com/1992/tv/reviews/masterpiece-theatre-portrait-of-a-marriage-parts-i-iii-1200430292/ \"Masterpiece Theatre Portrait of a Marriage Parts I-III\"], ''Variety'', 17 July 1992</ref>\n\n===''Challenge''===\nSackville-West's novel ''Challenge'' (1923) also bears witness to her affair with Keppel: Sackville-West and Keppel had started writing this book as a collaborative endeavour. It was published in America but banned in the UK until 1974.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\">[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jsackville.htm Spartacus Educational] Biography</ref>\n\nThe male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. ''Challenge'' (first entitled ''Rebellion'', then ''Enchantment'', then ''Vanity'' and at some point ''Foam''), is a ''roman \u00e0 clef'' with the character of Julian being a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Keppel.<ref>Sackville (2015) p5</ref><ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|133}} Notably, Sackville-West in ''Challenge'' defends Keppel against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Keppel a \"swine\" and a \"pig\", and in the book Julian goes out of his way to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} In the book, Julian says that \"Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nReflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an \"insinuating femininity\" that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}  Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Don't ''please'' dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} When ''Challenge'' was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: \"This book is yours, honoured witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} Throughout their relationship, Keppel was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Keppel.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nHer mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son [[Nigel Nicolson]] praises his mother: \"She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything ... How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?\"\n\nSackville-West was fascinated with and often wrote about the [[Romani people|Roma]] people. As the British scholar Kirstie Blair noted, for her: \"Gypsies represent liberation, excitement, danger and the free expression of sexuality\".<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141}} In particular, the Roma women, especially Spanish Romany women, served as a symbol for lesbianism in her writings.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} As with many other women writers in this period, for Sackville-West, the Romany represented a social element both familiar and strange; a people perceived and admired as flamboyant romantics while at the same time viewed and hated as shifty, dishonest types; a rootless people who belonged nowhere yet could be found everywhere in Europe, serving as a symbol for a sort of unconventional femininity.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142\u2013143}} The picture Sackville-West held of the Romany was much influenced by \"[[Orientalism]]\", as the Romany were believed to have originated from India. The idea of a people who belonged nowhere, existing outside of the values of \"civilization\", held genuine appeal to her as it offered up the possibility of gender roles different from those held in the West.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|144}}  Sackville-West was English, but she invented Romany ancestry for herself on the Spanish side of her family, explaining her bohemian behavior as due to her alleged \"Gypsy\" descent.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\n===''Orlando''===\nWoolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write her most famous novel, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' (1928), featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. {{efn|Woolf documented the moment of the conception of ''Orlando'': she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: \"And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other\" (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband [[Leonard Woolf]]).}} {{efn| Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write ''Orlando'', asking in a letter: \"But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind ... Do you mind, say Yes or No?\"<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|59}} }} Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|157}}  Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|158}}  ''Orlando'', which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} {{efn|After finishing ''Orlando'', Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: \"For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of ''Orlando''-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity ''passim''\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|213}} In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: \"Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting ... I'm not so sure ... I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks\".<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66}} }}\n\n===''Family History''===\nSackville-West's 1932 novel ''Family History'' tells the story of Evelyn Jarrold, a rich widow who married into a family which owes its recent wealth and social position to the ownership of coal mines, and her ill-fated love affair with Miles Vane-Merrick, a much younger man with progressive social ideas. Evelyn Jarrold's husband, Tommy, died in the Great War, and she has nothing to occupy her apart from her son Dan, the Jarrolds' heir, who is away at Eton, social events and visits to her dressmaker. Vane-Merrick is a farming landowner and Member of Parliament, and is writing a book on economics. He represents new, progressive values and the male world of work and economic activity, and Evelyn Jarrold represents traditional values and the female world of family ties and social engagements.\n\nThe characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in ''Family History'' are socialists, pacifists and feminists, thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} In ''Orlando'', Woolf allowed Vita to finally \"own\" Knole, and in ''Family History'', Vita returns the gesture, as the Anquetils have children who turned out to be intelligent and decent people.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} Woolf had never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother. In casting her fictional alter-ego as an excellent mother she was offering a \"gift\" to Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Other work and achievements===\nMost of the novels were an immediate success (except ''Dark Island'', ''Grand Canyon'' and ''La Grande Mademoiselle''). ''All Passion Spent'' (1931) and ''Seducers in Ecuador'' (1924) sold especially well. Somewhat Ironically ''Seducers'' overtook [[Virginia Woolf|her mentor's]] novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' at the top of the sales charts.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) p13</ref>\n\n''[[The Edwardians]]'' (1930) and ''[[All Passion Spent]]'' are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long suppressed sense of freedom and whimsy after a lifetime of following convention. This novel was dramatised by the [[BBC]] in 1986 starring Dame [[Wendy Hiller]]. ''All Passion Spent'' appears to reflect Woolf's influence. The character of Lady Slane begins to truly live only after the death of her husband, a former prime minister. She befriends the servants of her estate, discovering the lives of people she had previously ignored.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}} At the end of the novel Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage in order to pursue her career as a musician.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}}\n\n''Grand Canyon'' (1942) is a science fiction \"cautionary tale\" (as she termed it) about a Nazi invasion of an unprepared United States. The book takes an unsuspected twist, however, that makes it something more than a typical [[invasion literature|invasion yarn]].<ref>[https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/science-fiction-and-fantasy/dystopia-and-the-afterlife Pan Macmillan], ''Grand Canyon''</ref>\n\nThe poetry remains the least known of Sackville-West's work. It encompassed epics and translations of volumes such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]''. Her epic poems ''The Land'' (1926) and ''The Garden'' (1946) reflect an enduring passion for the earth and family tradition.''The Land'' may have been written in response to the central work of Modernist poetry ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (also published by Hogarth Press). She dedicated her poem to her lover [[Dorothy Wellesley]]. A recording of Sackville-West reading it was released by [[Columbia Records]].<ref>''Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252'' (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), p. 375.

D 40192/3).</ref>\n<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp13-14</ref> Her poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] in 1927. She won it again in 1933 with her ''Collected Poems'', becoming the only writer to do so twice.<ref name=\"National Trust\"/> ''The Garden'' won the [[Heinemann Award]] for literature.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/>\n\nHer epic poem ''Solitude'', published by the [[Hogarth Press]] in October 1938 contains references to the Bible, [[Paracelsus]], [[Ixion]], [[Catullus]], [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Sabine bride]], all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} The narrator of ''Solitude'' has an ardent love of the English countryside. Though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer present and who is deeply missed.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} At one point, the narrator's horror and disgust at Ixion, a brutal rapist, implies that she is a woman. At another point in the poem, her desire to free Andromeda from her chains and to make love suggests that she is a lesbian.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|412\u2013413}} The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books, as both cultivate her mind. She thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|414}}\n\nShe is not well known as a biographer. The most famous of those works is her biography of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] in the work of the same name. Additionally, she composed a dual biography of [[Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila]] and [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] entitled ''The Eagle and the Dove,'' a biography of the author [[Aphra Behn]], and a biography of her maternal grandmother, the Spanish dancer known as ''Pepita''.\n\nDespite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often forced herself to participate in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to feel a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\">{{cite journal | last1=Nagel | first1=Rebecca | date=September 2008 | title=The Classical Tradition in Vita Sackville-West's ''Solitude | jstor=25691245 | journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=407\u2013427 | doi=10.1007/s12138-009-0048-z}}</ref>{{rp|408}} Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favour with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/> In 1947 Sackville-West was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and [[Companion of Honour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The London Gazette Issue 38161 published on the 30 December 1947.

She published more than a dozen collections of poetry during her lifetime and 13 novels. She was twice awarded the [[Hawthornden Prize|Hawthornden Prize for Imaginative Literature]]: in 1927 for her pastoral epic, ''The Land'', and in 1933 for her ''Collected Poems''. She was the inspiration for the androgynous protagonist of ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', by her famous friend and lover, [[Virginia Woolf]].\n \nShe had a longstanding column in ''[[The Observer]]'' (1946\u20131961) and is remembered for the celebrated garden at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst]] created with her husband, Sir [[Harold Nicolson]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Antecedents===\n[[File:Victoria Josepha Sackville-West.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville|Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville]].

She didn't befriend local children and found it hard to make friends at school. Her biographers characterise her childhood as one filled by loneliness and isolation. She wrote prolifically at Knole, penning eight full-length (unpublished) novels between 1906\u20131910, ballads, and many plays, some in French. Her lack of formal education led to later shyness with her peers, such as those in the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. She felt herself to be sluggish of mind and she was never at the intellectual heart of her social group.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) pXiii</ref><ref>Sackville-West (2015) pp1-2</ref><ref>Rose, Norman,''Harold Nicolson'' Random House, 2014, pxxx</ref>\n[[File:Vita in childhood.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Vita in Childhood]]\n\nVita's apparently Roma lineage introduced a passion for 'gypsy' ways, a culture she perceived to be hot-blooded, heart-led, dark and romantic. It informed the stormy nature of many of Vita's later love affairs and was a strong theme in her writing. She visited Roma camps and felt herself to be at one with them.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\nVita's mother had a wide array of famous lovers, including financier [[J. P. Morgan]] and Sir John Murray Scott (from 1897 until his death in 1912). Scott, secretary to the couple who inherited and developed the [[Wallace Collection]], was a devoted companion and Lady Sackville and he were rarely apart during their years together. During her childhood, Vita spent a great deal of time in Scott's apartments in Paris, perfecting her already fluent French.<ref name=\"Sackville-West 2015 p2\"/>\n\n===First loves===\nVita [[Debutante#United Kingdom|debuted]] in 1910, shortly after the death of King [[Edward VII]].

After the wedding the couple lived in [[Cihangir]], a suburb of [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul), the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, but the duties of a diplomat's wife did not appeal to her.

Vita often dressed as a man, styled as Keppel's husband.  The two women made a bond to remain faithful to one another, pledging that neither would engage in sexual relations with their husband. {{efn|In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Keppel, Sackville-West wrote: I never ought to have married you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you for as long as you wanted me ...

These trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel ''To the Lighthouse'', noteworthy for its theme of longing for someone absent, was partly inspired by Sackville-West's frequent absences. Sackville-West inspired Woolf to write one of her most famous novels, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries.

Nicolson provided the architectural structure, with strong classical lines, which would frame his wife's innovative informal planting schemes. She created a new and experimental system of enclosures or rooms, such as the White Garden, Rose Garden, Orchard, Cottage Garden and Nuttery. She also innovated single colour-themed gardens and design principles orientating the visitors' experience to discovery and exploration. Her first garden at [[Long Barn]] (Kent, 1915\u20131930) was experimental, a place of learning by trial and error and she carried over her ideas and projects to Sissinghurst, utilising her hard won experience.<ref name=\"GBG\"/> Sissinghurst was first opened to the public in 1938.\n\n[[File:Sissinghurst_Gardens_1_(4907255329).jpg|thumb|Sissinghurst]]\nSackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break as she needed money to pay for Sissinghurst.

In it she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson and why she had fallen in love with Violet Keppel. The work, titled ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', was not published until 1973.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In the book she uses metaphors from nature to present her account as truthful and honest, describing her life as a \"bog\" and a \"swamp\", suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality. She wrote that in the future \"it will be recognized that many more people of my type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nReflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Keppel as both \"deviant\" and \"natural\", as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Georgia Johnston has argued that Sackville-West's confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Keppel while at same time declaring her \"shame\" about this \"duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> At various times, Sackville-West called herself a \"pariah\" with a \"perverted nature\" and \"unnatural\" feelings for Keppel, who was portrayed as a tempting, if degrading, object of her desire.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Sackville-West called for a \"spirit of candor\" in society that would allow for tolerance of gay and bisexual people.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], Sackville-West sometimes wrote of her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but failed to live up to.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nSeveral times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote ''Portrait of a Marriage'' for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/> Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a \"scientific\" approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|127\u2013128}} Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared \"she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|128\u2013129}} Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>\n\nIn 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published ''Portrait of a Marriage'', he was uncertain if he was going to be charged with obscenity, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|130\u2013131}} Despite portraying herself as in some way \"deviant\" because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in ''Portrait of a Marriage'' of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous \"liberation of half my personality\", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with \"deviant\" sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her \"perverted\" sexuality.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}} Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Keppel as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing \"even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self.\"<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|131}}\n\nThe memoir was [[Portrait of a Marriage (TV series)|dramatised by the BBC]] (and [[PBS]] in North America) in 1990, starring [[Janet McTeer]] as Vita, and [[Cathryn Harrison]] as Violet.

It was published in America but banned in the UK until 1974.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\">[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jsackville.htm Spartacus Educational] Biography</ref>\n\nThe male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. ''Challenge'' (first entitled ''Rebellion'', then ''Enchantment'', then ''Vanity'' and at some point ''Foam''), is a ''roman \u00e0 clef'' with the character of Julian being a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Keppel.<ref>Sackville (2015) p5</ref><ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|133}} Notably, Sackville-West in ''Challenge'' defends Keppel against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Keppel a \"swine\" and a \"pig\", and in the book Julian goes out of his way to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} In the book, Julian says that \"Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nReflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an \"insinuating femininity\" that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}  Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Don't ''please'' dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} When ''Challenge'' was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: \"This book is yours, honoured witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free\".<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} Throughout their relationship, Keppel was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}} The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Keppel.<ref name=\"johnston-2004\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nHer mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son [[Nigel Nicolson]] praises his mother: \"She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything ... How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?\"\n\nSackville-West was fascinated with and often wrote about the [[Romani people|Roma]] people. As the British scholar Kirstie Blair noted, for her: \"Gypsies represent liberation, excitement, danger and the free expression of sexuality\".<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141}} In particular, the Roma women, especially Spanish Romany women, served as a symbol for lesbianism in her writings.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} As with many other women writers in this period, for Sackville-West, the Romany represented a social element both familiar and strange; a people perceived and admired as flamboyant romantics while at the same time viewed and hated as shifty, dishonest types; a rootless people who belonged nowhere yet could be found everywhere in Europe, serving as a symbol for a sort of unconventional femininity.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142\u2013143}} The picture Sackville-West held of the Romany was much influenced by \"[[Orientalism]]\", as the Romany were believed to have originated from India. The idea of a people who belonged nowhere, existing outside of the values of \"civilization\", held genuine appeal to her as it offered up the possibility of gender roles different from those held in the West.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|144}}  Sackville-West was English, but she invented Romany ancestry for herself on the Spanish side of her family, explaining her bohemian behavior as due to her alleged \"Gypsy\" descent.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\n===''Orlando''===\nWoolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write her most famous novel, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' (1928), featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. {{efn|Woolf documented the moment of the conception of ''Orlando'': she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: \"And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other\" (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband [[Leonard Woolf]]).}} {{efn| Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write ''Orlando'', asking in a letter: \"But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind ... Do you mind, say Yes or No?\"<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|59}} }} Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|157}}  Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside.<ref name=\"blair-2004\"/>{{rp|158}}  ''Orlando'', which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|206}} {{efn|After finishing ''Orlando'', Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: \"For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of ''Orlando''-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity ''passim''\".<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|213}} In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: \"Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting ... I'm not so sure ... I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks\".<ref name=\"smith-2006\"/>{{rp|66}} }}\n\n===''Family History''===\nSackville-West's 1932 novel ''Family History'' tells the story of Evelyn Jarrold, a rich widow who married into a family which owes its recent wealth and social position to the ownership of coal mines, and her ill-fated love affair with Miles Vane-Merrick, a much younger man with progressive social ideas. Evelyn Jarrold's husband, Tommy, died in the Great War, and she has nothing to occupy her apart from her son Dan, the Jarrolds' heir, who is away at Eton, social events and visits to her dressmaker. Vane-Merrick is a farming landowner and Member of Parliament, and is writing a book on economics. He represents new, progressive values and the male world of work and economic activity, and Evelyn Jarrold represents traditional values and the female world of family ties and social engagements.\n\nThe characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in ''Family History'' are socialists, pacifists and feminists, thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} In ''Orlando'', Woolf allowed Vita to finally \"own\" Knole, and in ''Family History'', Vita returns the gesture, as the Anquetils have children who turned out to be intelligent and decent people.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}} Woolf had never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother. In casting her fictional alter-ego as an excellent mother she was offering a \"gift\" to Woolf.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Other work and achievements===\nMost of the novels were an immediate success (except ''Dark Island'', ''Grand Canyon'' and ''La Grande Mademoiselle''). ''All Passion Spent'' (1931) and ''Seducers in Ecuador'' (1924) sold especially well. Somewhat Ironically ''Seducers'' overtook [[Virginia Woolf|her mentor's]] novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' at the top of the sales charts.<ref>Sackville-West (2015) p13</ref>\n\n''[[The Edwardians]]'' (1930) and ''[[All Passion Spent]]'' are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long suppressed sense of freedom and whimsy after a lifetime of following convention. This novel was dramatised by the [[BBC]] in 1986 starring Dame [[Wendy Hiller]]. ''All Passion Spent'' appears to reflect Woolf's influence. The character of Lady Slane begins to truly live only after the death of her husband, a former prime minister. She befriends the servants of her estate, discovering the lives of people she had previously ignored.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}} At the end of the novel Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage in order to pursue her career as a musician.<ref name=\"desalvo-1982\"/>{{rp|211}}\n\n''Grand Canyon'' (1942) is a science fiction \"cautionary tale\" (as she termed it) about a Nazi invasion of an unprepared United States. The book takes an unsuspected twist, however, that makes it something more than a typical [[invasion literature|invasion yarn]].<ref>[https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/science-fiction-and-fantasy/dystopia-and-the-afterlife Pan Macmillan], ''Grand Canyon''</ref>\n\nThe poetry remains the least known of Sackville-West's work. It encompassed epics and translations of volumes such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]''. Her epic poems ''The Land'' (1926) and ''The Garden'' (1946) reflect an enduring passion for the earth and family tradition.''The Land'' may have been written in response to the central work of Modernist poetry ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (also published by Hogarth Press). She dedicated her poem to her lover [[Dorothy Wellesley]]. A recording of Sackville-West reading it was released by [[Columbia Records]].<ref>''Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252'' (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), p. 375.

She won it again in 1933 with her ''Collected Poems'', becoming the only writer to do so twice.<ref name=\"National Trust\"/> ''The Garden'' won the [[Heinemann Award]] for literature.<ref name=\"Spartacus Educational\"/>\n\nHer epic poem ''Solitude'', published by the [[Hogarth Press]] in October 1938 contains references to the Bible, [[Paracelsus]], [[Ixion]], [[Catullus]], [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Sabine bride]], all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} The narrator of ''Solitude'' has an ardent love of the English countryside. Though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer present and who is deeply missed.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|409}} At one point, the narrator's horror and disgust at Ixion, a brutal rapist, implies that she is a woman. At another point in the poem, her desire to free Andromeda from her chains and to make love suggests that she is a lesbian.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|412\u2013413}} The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books, as both cultivate her mind. She thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/>{{rp|414}}\n\nShe is not well known as a biographer. The most famous of those works is her biography of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] in the work of the same name. Additionally, she composed a dual biography of [[Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila]] and [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] entitled ''The Eagle and the Dove,'' a biography of the author [[Aphra Behn]], and a biography of her maternal grandmother, the Spanish dancer known as ''Pepita''.\n\nDespite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often forced herself to participate in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to feel a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\">{{cite journal | last1=Nagel | first1=Rebecca | date=September 2008 | title=The Classical Tradition in Vita Sackville-West's ''Solitude | jstor=25691245 | journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=407\u2013427 | doi=10.1007/s12138-009-0048-z}}</ref>{{rp|408}} Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favour with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin.<ref name=\"nagel-2008\"/> In 1947 Sackville-West was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and [[Companion of Honour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The London Gazette Issue 38161 published on the 30 December 1947.

H. Asquith]] and [[Winston Churchill]] both served as Chancellor, Prime Minister and Home Secretary while [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[John Major]] served as Prime Minister, Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. [[Rab Butler]] and [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. Two of the Great Offices of State have often been held simultaneously by one person, most recently by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in 1924; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]] is the only person to have held three of the Great Offices simultaneously, serving as Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary in the [[Wellington caretaker ministry]].\n\n==Commons-only nature in modern times==\nOwing to the political constitution of the United Kingdom, in which the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] retains most of the power, it is accepted that it is no longer practical for holders of the Great Offices of State to be members of the [[House of Lords]]. The House of Lords has traditionally been restrained in the passage of financial bills, meaning that the office of Chancellor is effectively limited to the House of Commons. The last holders of the other positions to have been peers were:\n\n*Prime Minister: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Alec Douglas-Home|The Earl of Home]] (20\u201323 October 1963): The Earl of Home renounced his peerage and was elected as an MP after his appointment as Prime Minister. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Prime Minister was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|The Marquess of Salisbury]] (25 June 1895 \u2013 11 July 1902).\n*Chancellor of the Exchequer: [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]] (14 November \u2013 15 December 1834): Denman only held the post on an acting basis as an [[ex officio]] duty of his role as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], as did the peer before him, [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Lord Tenterden]] (8 August\u20133 September 1827); the last member of the House of Lords to hold the office substantively was [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Viscount Stanhope]] (15 April 1717 \u2013 20 March 1718).\n*Foreign Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (5 May 1979 \u2013 5 April 1982): The Lord Carrington is the most recent peer to hold one of the Great Offices of State.\n*Home Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Viscount Cave]] (14 November 1918 \u2013 14 January 1919): Sir George Cave was ennobled as The Viscount Cave while serving as Home Secretary in 1918. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Home Secretary was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (28 December 1852 \u2013 6 February 1855). However, he was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]], meaning that he was not entitled to a seat in the Lords; the last holder to remain a member of the Lords was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|The Marquess of Normanby]] (30 August 1839 \u2013 30 August 1841).\n\nIt is most exceptional that a holder of a Great Office of State should not hold a seat in Parliament at all, neither in the Commons nor in the Lords. It occurred briefly in 1963, when [[Alec Douglas-Home]] was appointed Prime Minister: he disclaimed his peerage on 23 October, and was not returned to the Commons until a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election]] on 7 November. More substantially, [[Patrick Gordon Walker]] was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1964 despite not holding a Parliamentary seat, having been defeated in his [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|Smethwick]] constituency seat in the 1964 general election; he held the post for three months until his resignation in January 1965.\n\n==Women==\nSix women have held one or more Great Offices of State, with four of the six being members of the Conservative Party. Out of the four Offices, three have been held by women; Chancellor of the Exchequer is the only position that has not. Due to her ascension to the office of Prime Minister in July 2016, Theresa May became the first woman to hold two different Great Offices of State, with the appointment of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary resulting in the first period in which more than one of the Offices were held by women simultaneously.\n\n'''Prime Minister:'''\n\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990) (Conservative)\n*[[Theresa May]] (2016\u20132019) (Conservative)\n\n'''Chancellor of the Exchequer:'''\n\nNo woman has yet served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n\n'''Foreign Secretary''':\n\n*[[Margaret Beckett]] (2006\u20132007) (Labour)\n\n'''Home Secretary''': \n\n*[[Jacqui Smith]] (2007\u20132009) (Labour)\n*[[Theresa May]] (2010\u20132016) (Conservative)\n*[[Amber Rudd]] (2016\u20132018) (Conservative)\n*[[Priti Patel]] (2019\u2013present) (Conservative)\n\n==Ethnic minorities==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020}}\n[[Benjamin Disraeli]] became the first person of an ethnic minority to attain one of the Great Offices of State when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852.

H. Asquith]] and [[Winston Churchill]] both served as Chancellor, Prime Minister and Home Secretary while [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[John Major]] served as Prime Minister, Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. [[Rab Butler]] and [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. Two of the Great Offices of State have often been held simultaneously by one person, most recently by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in 1924; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]] is the only person to have held three of the Great Offices simultaneously, serving as Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary in the [[Wellington caretaker ministry]].\n\n==Commons-only nature in modern times==\nOwing to the political constitution of the United Kingdom, in which the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] retains most of the power, it is accepted that it is no longer practical for holders of the Great Offices of State to be members of the [[House of Lords]]. The House of Lords has traditionally been restrained in the passage of financial bills, meaning that the office of Chancellor is effectively limited to the House of Commons. The last holders of the other positions to have been peers were:\n\n*Prime Minister: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Alec Douglas-Home|The Earl of Home]] (20\u201323 October 1963): The Earl of Home renounced his peerage and was elected as an MP after his appointment as Prime Minister. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Prime Minister was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|The Marquess of Salisbury]] (25 June 1895 \u2013 11 July 1902).\n*Chancellor of the Exchequer: [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]] (14 November \u2013 15 December 1834): Denman only held the post on an acting basis as an [[ex officio]] duty of his role as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], as did the peer before him, [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Lord Tenterden]] (8 August\u20133 September 1827); the last member of the House of Lords to hold the office substantively was [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Viscount Stanhope]] (15 April 1717 \u2013 20 March 1718).\n*Foreign Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (5 May 1979 \u2013 5 April 1982): The Lord Carrington is the most recent peer to hold one of the Great Offices of State.\n*Home Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Viscount Cave]] (14 November 1918 \u2013 14 January 1919): Sir George Cave was ennobled as The Viscount Cave while serving as Home Secretary in 1918. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Home Secretary was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (28 December 1852 \u2013 6 February 1855). However, he was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]], meaning that he was not entitled to a seat in the Lords; the last holder to remain a member of the Lords was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|The Marquess of Normanby]] (30 August 1839 \u2013 30 August 1841).\n\nIt is most exceptional that a holder of a Great Office of State should not hold a seat in Parliament at all, neither in the Commons nor in the Lords. It occurred briefly in 1963, when [[Alec Douglas-Home]] was appointed Prime Minister: he disclaimed his peerage on 23 October, and was not returned to the Commons until a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election]] on 7 November. More substantially, [[Patrick Gordon Walker]] was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1964 despite not holding a Parliamentary seat, having been defeated in his [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|Smethwick]] constituency seat in the 1964 general election; he held the post for three months until his resignation in January 1965.\n\n==Women==\nSix women have held one or more Great Offices of State, with four of the six being members of the Conservative Party. Out of the four Offices, three have been held by women; Chancellor of the Exchequer is the only position that has not. Due to her ascension to the office of Prime Minister in July 2016, Theresa May became the first woman to hold two different Great Offices of State, with the appointment of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary resulting in the first period in which more than one of the Offices were held by women simultaneously.\n\n'''Prime Minister:'''\n\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990) (Conservative)\n*[[Theresa May]] (2016\u20132019) (Conservative)\n\n'''Chancellor of the Exchequer:'''\n\nNo woman has yet served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n\n'''Foreign Secretary''':\n\n*[[Margaret Beckett]] (2006\u20132007) (Labour)\n\n'''Home Secretary''': \n\n*[[Jacqui Smith]] (2007\u20132009) (Labour)\n*[[Theresa May]] (2010\u20132016) (Conservative)\n*[[Amber Rudd]] (2016\u20132018) (Conservative)\n*[[Priti Patel]] (2019\u2013present) (Conservative)\n\n==Ethnic minorities==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020}}\n[[Benjamin Disraeli]] became the first person of an ethnic minority to attain one of the Great Offices of State when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units.

Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs).

Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment.

Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). Reinforcements arrived on 4 November 1999 comprising 37 members of 3AFDS,<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.86.</ref> an integrated permanent and reserve squadron headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley (subsequently disbanded in December 2006). The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR). The Commanding Officer 7RAR, Lieutenant Colonel Shane Gabriel, commenced his military career as an RAAF GRDEFO, serving with 2AFDS and as Base Ground Defence Officer, RAAF Base Tindal; he has also served with the RAF Regiment.<ref>[[#ref7RARAssnWeb|7RAR Assn website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref>\n\n===Afghanistan===\nThe RAAF Control and Reporting Centre, based at Kandahar airport, included an embedded ground defence element which provided specialist force protection advice.<ref>[[#refQT2008|Queensland Times, 26 March 2008]]</ref> This deployment formed part of [[Operation Slipper]], the ADF contribution to the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF). ADGs continue to be deployed to the [[Middle East Area of Operations]] (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

Today it remains an important market in [[East Anglia]].\n\nBuilt on the banks of the wide [[River Great Ouse]] between [[Huntingdon]] and [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], St Ives has a famous [[St Ives Bridge|chapel on its bridge]]. In the [[Anglo-Saxon]] era, St Ives's position on the Great Ouse was strategic, as it controlled the last natural crossing point or ford on the river, {{convert|80|km|mi}} from the sea. The flint reef in the bed of the river at this point gave rise to a ford, which then provided the foundations for the celebrated bridge.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, St Ives was a hub of trade and navigation, and the town had dozens of inns and many bawdy houses {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Goods were brought into the town on barges, and livestock rested on the last fattening grounds before delivery to London's [[Smithfield Market]]. As the railway network expanded and roads improved, the use of the River Great Ouse declined. It is now mostly used for leisure boats and recreation.\n\nThe river Great Ouse at St Ives flooded in 1947, and some parts suffered seriously again at Easter 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saint-ives.info/history/Floods/ |title=1998 Floods in St Ives |accessdate=6 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721232441/http://saint-ives.info/history/Floods/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> and in January 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-ives.info/history/floods2003/ |title=2003 Floods in St Ives|accessdate=6 September 2009}}</ref> Extensive flood protection works were carried out on both sides of the river in 2006-07 at a cost of nearly \u00a39&nbsp;million. {{convert|500|m|ft}} of brick-clad steel-piling was put into place to protect the town, most noticeably at the Waits, where a plaza has also been created.

From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]]. In 1974, following the [[Local Government Act 1972]], St Ives became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nAt Westminster St Ives is in the parliamentary constituency of [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]],<ref name=\"OSelec\" /> and since 2001 has been represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[Jonathan Djanogly]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]).\n\n==Geography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}\nSt Ives was the subject of town planning at a very early date,{{When|date=February 2009}} giving it a spacious town centre. Portions of the open space between Merryland and Crown Street were lost to market stalls that turned into permanent buildings. Some of the shops in the town centre are still in the same layout as in [[medieval]] times, one [[rod (length)|rod]] in width, the standard length for floor and roof [[joist]]s. The lanes along the north side of town are believed to follow the layout of the narrow medieval fields, and are slightly S-shaped because of the way ploughs turned at each end. Similar field boundaries can be seen in Warners Park.\n\n==Demography==\n===Population===\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of St Ives was recorded every ten years by the [[Census in the United Kingdom|UK census]].

As livestock sales diminished, however, so did the need for large numbers of pubs, falling to a low point of 16 in 1962. In that year the ''Seven Wives'' on Ramsey Road was opened and, with some openings and closings since, there are 17 today. The oldest name is the ''Dolphin''; in use on the same site for over 300 years, it's current usage is for a hotel built in 1985. Next oldest is the ''White Hart'', which is pre-1720. ''Nelson's Head'' and ''Golden Lion'' are at least as old but have not kept the same name: they used to be called the ''Three Tuns'' and the ''Red Lion'' respectively. There has been a pub on the site of the ''Robin Hood'' from a similar date; in fact it was originally two separate pubs: the ''Angel'' and the ''Swan''. The claim of the Royal Oak to date from 1502 cannot be proven since, while a portion at the back is 17th-century (making it physically the oldest portion of any pub in St Ives), the pub name is more recent. The reference is to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s famous escape from [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s [[Roundheads]], and Charles was restored to the throne in 1660.<ref>{{citation|title=The Pubs of St Ives|first=Bob|last=Burn-Murdoch|edition=3rd|publisher=Friends of the Norris Museum|date=16 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Golden Lion'' was a 19th-century [[coaching inn]].<ref name=fisher>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWyrAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA151&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=British River Navigations: Inland Cuts, Fens, Dikes, Channels and Non-tidal Rivers |publisher=A&C Black |author=Stuart Fisher |year=2013 |page=151 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781472906687 }}</ref> ''The Official Guide to the Great Eastern Railway'' referred to it in 1893 as one of two \"leading hotels\" in St Ives<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MJRAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA271 |title=The Official Guide to the Great Eastern Railway |publisher=Cassell |author=Great Eastern Railway |year=1893 |page=271 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> and there are a number of ghost stories associated with the pub.<ref name=fisher/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EH-IAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=Paranormal Cambridgeshire |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |author=Damien O'Dell |year=2013 |page=53 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781445629940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkqIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT69&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=Military Ghosts |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |author=Alan Wood |year=2013 |page=69 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781445625225 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-nWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Golden+Lion%22++%22St+Ives%22 |title=The International Directory of Haunted Places |publisher=Penguin Group |author=Dennis William Hauck |year=2000 |page=18 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9780140296358 }}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England-7Aug2011.jpg|thumb|St Ives bridge and the River Great Ouse]]\n[[File:St Ives Cambs Oliver Cromwell statue.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Statue of Oliver Cromwell, St Ives|Statue of Oliver Cromwell]] on Market Hill in the town centre]]\n\n===St Ives Bridge===\n{{Main|St Ives Bridge}}\nSt Ives Bridge is most unusual in incorporating a [[chapel]], the most striking of only four examples in England. Also unusual are its two southern arches which are a different shape from the rest of the bridge, being rounded instead of slightly [[gothic architecture|gothic]]. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537, the chapel was given to the prior to live in. The lords of the manor of St Ives changed hands several times, as did the chapel. During this period, it was in turn - a private house, a doctors surgery and a pub, called Little Hell. The pub had a reputation for rowdy behaviour, and it is believed the landlord kept pigs in the basement. The additional two storeys added in the seventeenth century were removed in 1930, due to damage being caused to the foundations. \nThe chapel features colourfully in the historical novel 'Not Just a Whore', by local St Ives resident K M Warwick, where it is described as a fictitious \"Bawdy House\" (brothel). The bridge was partially rebuilt after [[Oliver Cromwell]] knocked down two arches during the [[English Civil War]] to prevent [[Charles I of England|King Charles I's]] troops approaching London from the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] base in [[Lincolnshire]]. During the war and for some period afterwards, the gap was covered by a [[drawbridge]]. The town square contains a [[Statue of Oliver Cromwell, St Ives|statue of Oliver Cromwell]] erected in 1901. It is one of four statues of Cromwell on public display in Britain, the others being in [[Parliament Square]], outside [[Wythenshawe Hall]] and in [[Warrington]].\n\nSt Ives Corn Exchange is the home of St Ives Youth Theatre (SIYT).\n\n===Holt Island===\nThe eastern or town end of Holt Island is nature reserve, and the western end, opposite the parish church, is a facility for the Sea [[Scouts]]. The scout portion contains what was, before the opening of the Leisure Centre, the town's outdoor town swimming pool. The pool was dug in 1913 and closed to the public in 1949.<ref name=StIvesMillenium>{{cite news|title=St Ives a new Millenium|pages=8&ndash;9|newspaper=St Ives Photo Publication Group|publisher=Inchcape|year= 2002}}{{sic}}</ref> It is now used by the scouts for canoeing and rappelling.

Many other Christian denominations are also represented, and the town also has a [[mosque]] and an [[Islamic]] Community Centre.\n\nAll Saints Church ([[Church of England]]) on Church Street has been in the town since AD970 and is one of only two [[Grade I listed building]]s in the town, the other being The Bridge. Originally the parish church of the settlement of Slepe, before St Ives came into existence, it now enjoys a tranquil location at the end of Church Street, situated to the west of the town centre. All Saints, as it stands today, dates largely from the rebuilding of the late 15th century. It was extensively reordered in the late 19th century by [[Ninian Comper|Sir Ninian Comper]].\n\nThe church which dominates the town's market place, is The Free Church ([[United Reformed Church]]). This was built in 1864, but was modernised in 1980, moving the worship area upstairs. The [[Sacred Heart Church, St Ives|Church of the Sacred Heart]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) on Needingworth Road, was originally built by [[Augustus Pugin]] in Cambridge, but was dismantled in 1902 and transported by barge to St Ives. The hall at the back was added in about 2001. The current [[Methodist Church]] on The Waits opened in 1905. Crossways Church ([[Assembly of God]]) meet at Crossways Christian Centre on Ramsey Road.

Made from discarded inferior wool and/or other felt fibres, it was a popular source of cheap material bought by the locals, and those further afield, who flocked to the market in their droves to buy cheap supplies for their own domestic clothing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe famous war poet [[Rupert Brooke]] lived at [[Grantchester]] some {{convert|32|km|mi}} away in the same [[county]].

In the [[Anglo-Saxon]] era, St Ives's position on the Great Ouse was strategic, as it controlled the last natural crossing point or ford on the river, {{convert|80|km|mi}} from the sea. The flint reef in the bed of the river at this point gave rise to a ford, which then provided the foundations for the celebrated bridge.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, St Ives was a hub of trade and navigation, and the town had dozens of inns and many bawdy houses {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Goods were brought into the town on barges, and livestock rested on the last fattening grounds before delivery to London's [[Smithfield Market]]. As the railway network expanded and roads improved, the use of the River Great Ouse declined. It is now mostly used for leisure boats and recreation.\n\nThe river Great Ouse at St Ives flooded in 1947, and some parts suffered seriously again at Easter 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saint-ives.info/history/Floods/ |title=1998 Floods in St Ives |accessdate=6 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721232441/http://saint-ives.info/history/Floods/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> and in January 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-ives.info/history/floods2003/ |title=2003 Floods in St Ives|accessdate=6 September 2009}}</ref> Extensive flood protection works were carried out on both sides of the river in 2006-07 at a cost of nearly \u00a39&nbsp;million. {{convert|500|m|ft}} of brick-clad steel-piling was put into place to protect the town, most noticeably at the Waits, where a plaza has also been created.

Some of the shops in the town centre are still in the same layout as in [[medieval]] times, one [[rod (length)|rod]] in width, the standard length for floor and roof [[joist]]s. The lanes along the north side of town are believed to follow the layout of the narrow medieval fields, and are slightly S-shaped because of the way ploughs turned at each end. Similar field boundaries can be seen in Warners Park.\n\n==Demography==\n===Population===\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of St Ives was recorded every ten years by the [[Census in the United Kingdom|UK census]].

As livestock sales diminished, however, so did the need for large numbers of pubs, falling to a low point of 16 in 1962. In that year the ''Seven Wives'' on Ramsey Road was opened and, with some openings and closings since, there are 17 today. The oldest name is the ''Dolphin''; in use on the same site for over 300 years, it's current usage is for a hotel built in 1985. Next oldest is the ''White Hart'', which is pre-1720. ''Nelson's Head'' and ''Golden Lion'' are at least as old but have not kept the same name: they used to be called the ''Three Tuns'' and the ''Red Lion'' respectively. There has been a pub on the site of the ''Robin Hood'' from a similar date; in fact it was originally two separate pubs: the ''Angel'' and the ''Swan''. The claim of the Royal Oak to date from 1502 cannot be proven since, while a portion at the back is 17th-century (making it physically the oldest portion of any pub in St Ives), the pub name is more recent. The reference is to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s famous escape from [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s [[Roundheads]], and Charles was restored to the throne in 1660.<ref>{{citation|title=The Pubs of St Ives|first=Bob|last=Burn-Murdoch|edition=3rd|publisher=Friends of the Norris Museum|date=16 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Golden Lion'' was a 19th-century [[coaching inn]].<ref name=fisher>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWyrAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA151&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=British River Navigations: Inland Cuts, Fens, Dikes, Channels and Non-tidal Rivers |publisher=A&C Black |author=Stuart Fisher |year=2013 |page=151 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781472906687 }}</ref> ''The Official Guide to the Great Eastern Railway'' referred to it in 1893 as one of two \"leading hotels\" in St Ives<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MJRAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA271 |title=The Official Guide to the Great Eastern Railway |publisher=Cassell |author=Great Eastern Railway |year=1893 |page=271 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> and there are a number of ghost stories associated with the pub.<ref name=fisher/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EH-IAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=Paranormal Cambridgeshire |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |author=Damien O'Dell |year=2013 |page=53 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781445629940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkqIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT69&dq=%22Golden+Lion%22 |title=Military Ghosts |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |author=Alan Wood |year=2013 |page=69 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9781445625225 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-nWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Golden+Lion%22++%22St+Ives%22 |title=The International Directory of Haunted Places |publisher=Penguin Group |author=Dennis William Hauck |year=2000 |page=18 |accessdate=29 July 2014|isbn=9780140296358 }}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England-7Aug2011.jpg|thumb|St Ives bridge and the River Great Ouse]]\n[[File:St Ives Cambs Oliver Cromwell statue.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Statue of Oliver Cromwell, St Ives|Statue of Oliver Cromwell]] on Market Hill in the town centre]]\n\n===St Ives Bridge===\n{{Main|St Ives Bridge}}\nSt Ives Bridge is most unusual in incorporating a [[chapel]], the most striking of only four examples in England. Also unusual are its two southern arches which are a different shape from the rest of the bridge, being rounded instead of slightly [[gothic architecture|gothic]]. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537, the chapel was given to the prior to live in. The lords of the manor of St Ives changed hands several times, as did the chapel. During this period, it was in turn - a private house, a doctors surgery and a pub, called Little Hell. The pub had a reputation for rowdy behaviour, and it is believed the landlord kept pigs in the basement. The additional two storeys added in the seventeenth century were removed in 1930, due to damage being caused to the foundations. \nThe chapel features colourfully in the historical novel 'Not Just a Whore', by local St Ives resident K M Warwick, where it is described as a fictitious \"Bawdy House\" (brothel). The bridge was partially rebuilt after [[Oliver Cromwell]] knocked down two arches during the [[English Civil War]] to prevent [[Charles I of England|King Charles I's]] troops approaching London from the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] base in [[Lincolnshire]]. During the war and for some period afterwards, the gap was covered by a [[drawbridge]]. The town square contains a [[Statue of Oliver Cromwell, St Ives|statue of Oliver Cromwell]] erected in 1901. It is one of four statues of Cromwell on public display in Britain, the others being in [[Parliament Square]], outside [[Wythenshawe Hall]] and in [[Warrington]].\n\nSt Ives Corn Exchange is the home of St Ives Youth Theatre (SIYT).\n\n===Holt Island===\nThe eastern or town end of Holt Island is nature reserve, and the western end, opposite the parish church, is a facility for the Sea [[Scouts]]. The scout portion contains what was, before the opening of the Leisure Centre, the town's outdoor town swimming pool. The pool was dug in 1913 and closed to the public in 1949.<ref name=StIvesMillenium>{{cite news|title=St Ives a new Millenium|pages=8&ndash;9|newspaper=St Ives Photo Publication Group|publisher=Inchcape|year= 2002}}{{sic}}</ref> It is now used by the scouts for canoeing and rappelling.

Many other Christian denominations are also represented, and the town also has a [[mosque]] and an [[Islamic]] Community Centre.\n\nAll Saints Church ([[Church of England]]) on Church Street has been in the town since AD970 and is one of only two [[Grade I listed building]]s in the town, the other being The Bridge. Originally the parish church of the settlement of Slepe, before St Ives came into existence, it now enjoys a tranquil location at the end of Church Street, situated to the west of the town centre. All Saints, as it stands today, dates largely from the rebuilding of the late 15th century. It was extensively reordered in the late 19th century by [[Ninian Comper|Sir Ninian Comper]].\n\nThe church which dominates the town's market place, is The Free Church ([[United Reformed Church]]). This was built in 1864, but was modernised in 1980, moving the worship area upstairs. The [[Sacred Heart Church, St Ives|Church of the Sacred Heart]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) on Needingworth Road, was originally built by [[Augustus Pugin]] in Cambridge, but was dismantled in 1902 and transported by barge to St Ives. The hall at the back was added in about 2001. The current [[Methodist Church]] on The Waits opened in 1905. Crossways Church ([[Assembly of God]]) meet at Crossways Christian Centre on Ramsey Road. St Ives Christian Fellowship (Partnership) meet at Thorndown Junior School on Hill Rise. The Bridge Church (New Frontiers) meet in a newly renovated former industrial building on the corner of Burrel Road and Marley Road.

Made from discarded inferior wool and/or other felt fibres, it was a popular source of cheap material bought by the locals, and those further afield, who flocked to the market in their droves to buy cheap supplies for their own domestic clothing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe famous war poet [[Rupert Brooke]] lived at [[Grantchester]] some {{convert|32|km|mi}} away in the same [[county]].

It has been noted this practice in particular penalises scooter riders, who frequently find themselves being required to travel 1-2+ miles to perform a pickup, only to then undertake a delivery 3\u20134 miles away (totalling 5-6+), with no material visible distance benefit being paid over the base fee. The riders subsequently find themselves significantly 'out of zone', potentially in an area with low coverage, 'marooned', and no longer receiving orders unless they make the journey back in to zone first. This results in significant time wastage for the rider, undermining their ability to earn a reasonable hourly wage.\n\nAnother undermining tactic that has been observed is where riders, who might even have an excellent to exemplary 'performance statistic', arbitrarily have their previously reserved 'repeat' hours cut without warning, sometimes drastically (a cut of 4-plus days of work in a single week has been observed), from their pre-booking weekly calendar for no justifiable reason, thus seriously affecting the rider's ability to earn a stable income.  The reason given by Deliveroo was that the hours were given to other riders to meet the (over-subscribed) demand. This behaviour could potentially be interpreted as discriminatory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigebyte.com/deliveroo-cuts-rider-fees-to-cover-longer-distances|title=Deliveroo cuts rider fees whilst at the same time covering longer distances|date=10 April 2019|language=en-GB|access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*E McGaughey, 'Uber, the Taylor Review, and the duty to not misrepresent employment status' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3018516 Industrial Law Journal]\n*E McGaughey, 'Taylorooism: When Network Technology Meets Corporate Power' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247605 Industrial Relations Journal]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Deliveroo}}\n*{{Official website|deliveroo.co.uk}}\n{{Online food ordering}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deliveroo}}\n[[Category:British companies established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Online companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Online food ordering]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:2013 establishments in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Food delivery company}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Roofoods Ltd.\n| logo = Deliveroo logo.svg\n| type = [[Privately held company|Private]]\n| trade_name = Deliveroo\n| industry = {{Unbulleted list|[[Online food ordering]]|[[Food delivery]]}}\n| founder = [[Will Shu]]\n| hq_location = London, England, UK\n| area_served = {{Unbulleted list|[[United Kingdom]]|[[Netherlands]]|[[France]]|[[Belgium]]|[[Hong Kong]]|[[Ireland]]|[[Spain]]|[[Italy]]|[[Australia]]|[[Singapore]]|[[Kuwait]]|[[Puerto Rico]]|[[United Arab Emirates]]}}\n| key_people = Will Shu ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) <br> Greg Orlowski <br> Dan Winn ([[Chief technology officer|CTO]]) <br> Rohan Pradhan ([[Chief operating officer|COO]])\n| products = \n| revenue = \u00a3277.1 M (2017) <ref>{{Citation|title=Deliveroo profile |work=Craft |url=https://craft.co/deliveroo|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>\n| num_employees = 5,699 (2019)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://craft.co/deliveroo|title=Deliveroo Company Profile |publisher=Craft|accessdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* Around 20,000 technically self-employed couriers ({{As of|2016|9|lc=y}})<ref name=\"When-your-boss-is-an-algorithm\" />\n| website = {{url|deliveroo.co.uk}}\n| foundation = {{start date and age|2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Roofoods Ltd.'''

It has been noted this practice in particular penalises scooter riders, who frequently find themselves being required to travel 1-2+ miles to perform a pickup, only to then undertake a delivery 3\u20134 miles away (totalling 5-6+), with no material visible distance benefit being paid over the base fee. The riders subsequently find themselves significantly 'out of zone', potentially in an area with low coverage, 'marooned', and no longer receiving orders unless they make the journey back in to zone first. This results in significant time wastage for the rider, undermining their ability to earn a reasonable hourly wage.\n\nAnother undermining tactic that has been observed is where riders, who might even have an excellent to exemplary 'performance statistic', arbitrarily have their previously reserved 'repeat' hours cut without warning, sometimes drastically (a cut of 4-plus days of work in a single week has been observed), from their pre-booking weekly calendar for no justifiable reason, thus seriously affecting the rider's ability to earn a stable income.  The reason given by Deliveroo was that the hours were given to other riders to meet the (over-subscribed) demand. This behaviour could potentially be interpreted as discriminatory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigebyte.com/deliveroo-cuts-rider-fees-to-cover-longer-distances|title=Deliveroo cuts rider fees whilst at the same time covering longer distances|date=10 April 2019|language=en-GB|access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*E McGaughey, 'Uber, the Taylor Review, and the duty to not misrepresent employment status' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3018516 Industrial Law Journal]\n*E McGaughey, 'Taylorooism: When Network Technology Meets Corporate Power' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247605 Industrial Relations Journal]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Deliveroo}}\n*{{Official website|deliveroo.co.uk}}\n{{Online food ordering}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deliveroo}}\n[[Category:British companies established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Online companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Online food ordering]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:2013 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Ankman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory and basic operations:They pulled out of Germany as foot note 49 notes.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliveroo"}
