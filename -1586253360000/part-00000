Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, and atypical sexual interests.

Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.</ref>\n\nIn England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality (the term was coined by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]]), as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nEllis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].

The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.<ref>Goltz, Dustin (2008).

Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.\n\nHirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).<ref>{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten.

Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality (the term was coined by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]]), as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships.

The eleven asanas in the Surya Namaskar sequences A and B (of [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]]) were performed by beginners, advanced practitioners and instructors. The activation of 14 groups of muscles was measured with electrode on the skin over the muscles. Among the findings, beginners used [[pectoral muscle]]s more than instructors, whereas instructors used [[deltoid muscle]]s more than other practitioners, as well as the [[vastus medialis]] (which stabilises the knee). The yoga instructor Grace Bullock writes that such patterns of activation suggest that asana practice increases awareness of the body and the patterns in which muscles are engaged, making exercise more beneficial and safer.<ref name=\"NiMooney2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Ni |first1=Meng |last2=Mooney |first2=Kiersten |last3=Balachandran |first3=Anoop |last4=Richards |first4=Luca |last5=Harriell |first5=Kysha |last6=Signorile |first6=Joseph F. |title=Muscle utilization patterns vary by skill levels of the practitioners across specific yoga poses (asanas) |journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine |volume=22 |issue=4 |year=2014 |pages=662\u2013669 |issn=0965-2299 |doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2014.06.006|pmid=25146071 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bullock 2016\">{{cite web |last1=Bullock |first1=B.

Less than 3 METs counts as light exercise; 3 to 6 METs is moderate; 6 or over is vigorous. [[American College of Sports Medicine]] and [[American Heart Association]] guidelines count periods of at least 10 minutes of moderate MET level activity towards their recommended daily amounts of exercise.<ref name=\"Larson-Meyer 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Larson-Meyer |first1=D.

The eleven asanas in the Surya Namaskar sequences A and B (of [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]]) were performed by beginners, advanced practitioners and instructors. The activation of 14 groups of muscles was measured with electrode on the skin over the muscles. Among the findings, beginners used [[pectoral muscle]]s more than instructors, whereas instructors used [[deltoid muscle]]s more than other practitioners, as well as the [[vastus medialis]] (which stabilises the knee). The yoga instructor Grace Bullock writes that such patterns of activation suggest that asana practice increases awareness of the body and the patterns in which muscles are engaged, making exercise more beneficial and safer.<ref name=\"NiMooney2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Ni |first1=Meng |last2=Mooney |first2=Kiersten |last3=Balachandran |first3=Anoop |last4=Richards |first4=Luca |last5=Harriell |first5=Kysha |last6=Signorile |first6=Joseph F. |title=Muscle utilization patterns vary by skill levels of the practitioners across specific yoga poses (asanas) |journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine |volume=22 |issue=4 |year=2014 |pages=662\u2013669 |issn=0965-2299 |doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2014.06.006|pmid=25146071 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bullock 2016\">{{cite web |last1=Bullock |first1=B.
