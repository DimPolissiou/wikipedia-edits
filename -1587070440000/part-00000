France was the first ally of the new United States. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|The 1778 treaty and military support]] proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.  However, since then, relations have improved, with American favorable ratings of France reaching a historic high of 87% in 2016.<ref name=\"Opinion of the United States\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/country/74/ |title=Opinion of the United States |publisher=Pewglobal.org |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref name=\"France's Favorite Rating Zooms\">{{cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/189602/france-favorable-rating-zooms-new-high.aspx |title=France's Favorable Rating in U.S. Zooms to 87%, a New High |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=2018-04-12|date=February 25, 2016 }}</ref> [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] concluded, \"After diplomatic differences in 2003 soured relations between the two countries, France and the U.S. have found a common interest in combating international terrorism, and the mission has become personal for both countries.\"<ref name=\"France's Favorite Rating Zooms\"/>\n[[File:Trump talks with Macron at G7 Biarritz summit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] at the [[45th G7 summit|45th G7 in Biarritz]], August 2019.]]\n\n==Country comparison==\nLeaders of the France and United States since 1950:\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1600 height:auto barincrement:70\nPlotArea   = left:100 right:100 bottom:80 top:0\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nDefine $now = 31/12/2019\nPeriod      = from:01/01/1940 till:$now\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:5 start:01/01/1945\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1958\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\n\nColors =\n  id:sfio value:red    legend: French_Section_of_the_Workers'_International\n  id:cnip value:purple   legend: National_Centre_of_Independents_and_Peasants\n  id:fnri value:orange   legend: Union_for_French_Democracy\n  id:ump  value:blue     legend:Union_For_a_Popular_Movement\n  id:ps   value:red      legend:Socialist_Party_(France)\n  id:lrm  value:yellow   legend:La_R\u00e9publique_En_Marche!\n  id:dem  value:skyblue  legend:Democratic_Party_(US)\n  id:gop  value:pink     legend:Republican_Party_(US)\n\nBarData =\n bar:fr text:[[France]]\n bar:us text:[[United States]]\n\nPlotData=\n  align:center mark:(line,black)\n  bar:fr\n  from: 14/05/2017  till: $now color:yellow  text:\"[[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]]\"\n  from: 15/05/2012  till: 14/05/2017  color:red     text:\"[[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]]\"\n  from: 16/05/2007  till: 15/05/2012  color:blue    text:\"[[Nicolas Sarkozy]]\"\n  from: 17/05/1995  till: 16/05/2007  color:blue    text:\"[[Jacques Chirac]]\"\n  from: 21/05/1981  till: 17/05/1995  color:red     text:\"[[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]\"\n  from: 02/04/1974  till: 21/05/1981  color:orange  text:\"[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing|d'Estaing]]\"\n  from: 28/04/1969  till: 02/04/1974  color:pink    text:\"[[Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]]\"\n  from: 08/01/1959  till: 28/04/1969  color:pink    text:\"[[Charles de Gaulle]]\"\n  from: 03/12/1954  till: 08/01/1959  color:purple  text:\"[[Ren\u00e9 Coty]]\"\n  from: 16/01/1947  till: 03/12/1954  color:red   text:\"[[Vincent Auriol]]\n\n  bar:us\n  from: 20/01/2017 till: $now color:gop text:\"[[Donald Trump|Trump]]\"\n  from: 20/01/2009 till: 20/01/2017  color:dem  text:\"[[Barack Obama|Obama]]\"\n  from: 20/01/2001 till: 20/01/2009  color:gop  text:\"[[George W.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H. Van Tyne, \"Influences which Determined the French Government to Make the Treaty with America, 1778,\"\n''American Historical Review'' (1916) 21#3 pp. 528\u2013541 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1835010 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, '' The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787'' (1975)</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] where the French Navy defeated the Royal Navy in 1781]]\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Yorktown|Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]] depicting the English surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops.]]\nThe alliance improved with the arrival in the United States in 1780 of the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view.

Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side. Thus, the revolutionary government viewed Washington's policy as partial to the enemy.<ref>John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789-1801'' (1960)  [https://archive.org/details/federalistera197000675mbp online] pp 126-39.</ref>\n\nThe first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], toured the United States to organize U.S. expeditions against Spain and Britain. Exasperated, Washington demanded Gen\u00eat's recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Gen\u00eat. Washington refused to extradite Gen\u00eat (knowing he would otherwise be guillotined). Gen\u00eat became a U.S. citizen.<ref>Sioli, Marco. \"Citizen Gen\u00eat and Political Struggle in the Early American Republic.\" ''Revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes am\u00e9ricaines'' (1995): 259-267. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rfea_0397-7870_1995_num_64_1_1582 Online free in English]</ref>\n\nFrance regarded [[Jay's Treaty]] (November 1794) between Britain and the United States as hostile.  It opened a decade of trade when France was at war with Britain.\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] (1745-1829) was the third [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and [[John Adams]].  Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a \"quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,\" who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Republican Party opponents of the Administration.<ref>Gerard H. Clarfield, ''Timothy Pickering and American Diplomacy, 1795-1800'' (1969).</ref>\n\n===Quasi War 1798\u20131800===\nTo overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\", which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |title=American Foreign Relations: A History, to 1920 |last=Paterson |first=Thomas G. |author2=Clifford, J.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the \"entangling\" French alliance with the United States.<ref>E.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights. The British infringed more and also impressed thousands of American sailors into the Royal Navy; France never did anything like impressment.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812'' (2012) pp 17-47</ref>  Jefferson signed the [[Embargo Act]] in 1807, which forbade all exports and imports. Designed to hurt the British, it hurt American commerce far more. The destructive Embargo Act, which had brought U.S. trade to a standstill, was rescinded in 1809, as Jefferson left office. Both Britain and France remained hostile to the United States. The [[War of 1812]] was the logical extension of the embargo program as the United States declared war on Britain. However, there was never any sense of being an ally of France and no effort was made to coordinate military activity.<ref>Lawrence S.

The United States, in cooperation with Great Britain, issued the \"[[Monroe Doctrine]]\" in 1823 to keep European powers, especially Spain but also France, from seizing lands in the New World.  The French had a strong interest in expanding commercial opportunity in Latin America, especially as the Spanish role was faltering.  There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.  French officials ignored the American position.

Jackson's political opponents blocked any legislation.  France was annoyed but finally voted the money if the United States apologized.  Jackson refused to apologize, and diplomatic relations were broken off until in December 1835 Jackson did offer some friendlier words.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals. Very few self-styled French intellectuals were admirers.<ref>Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Hating America: A History'' (2005) p 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1906, when Germany challenged French influence in [[Morocco]] (''see'' [[Tangier Crisis]] and [[Agadir Crisis]]), President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sided with the French.

The French were annoyed that so many Americans were going to Germany for post-graduate education, and discussed how to attract more Americans.

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E.

Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine.\n\nA number of American artists, such as [[Josephine Baker]], experienced popular success in France. Paris was also quite welcoming to American [[jazz]] music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life.  Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

Germany had better warplanes,  more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange.

This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] as ambassador. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but it was helping Germany.

It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance.

The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295.

After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irwin M.

The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry.  France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F.

Johnson]], 1967]]\n\nWhile occasional tensions surfaced between the governments, the French public, except for the Communists, generally had a good opinion of the United States throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Despite some cultural friction, the United States was seen as a benevolent giant, the land of modernity, and French youth took a taste to American culture such as [[chewing gum]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[rock and roll]].\n\n===De Gaulle===\nIn the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. [[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve.

France was the first ally of the new United States. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|The 1778 treaty and military support]] proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H. Van Tyne, \"Influences which Determined the French Government to Make the Treaty with America, 1778,\"\n''American Historical Review'' (1916) 21#3 pp. 528\u2013541 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1835010 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, '' The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787'' (1975)</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] where the French Navy defeated the Royal Navy in 1781]]\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Yorktown|Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]] depicting the English surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops.]]\nThe alliance improved with the arrival in the United States in 1780 of the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view.

Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side. Thus, the revolutionary government viewed Washington's policy as partial to the enemy.<ref>John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789-1801'' (1960)  [https://archive.org/details/federalistera197000675mbp online] pp 126-39.</ref>\n\nThe first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], toured the United States to organize U.S. expeditions against Spain and Britain. Exasperated, Washington demanded Gen\u00eat's recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Gen\u00eat. Washington refused to extradite Gen\u00eat (knowing he would otherwise be guillotined). Gen\u00eat became a U.S. citizen.<ref>Sioli, Marco. \"Citizen Gen\u00eat and Political Struggle in the Early American Republic.\" ''Revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes am\u00e9ricaines'' (1995): 259-267. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rfea_0397-7870_1995_num_64_1_1582 Online free in English]</ref>\n\nFrance regarded [[Jay's Treaty]] (November 1794) between Britain and the United States as hostile.  It opened a decade of trade when France was at war with Britain.\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] (1745-1829) was the third [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and [[John Adams]].  Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a \"quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,\" who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Republican Party opponents of the Administration.<ref>Gerard H. Clarfield, ''Timothy Pickering and American Diplomacy, 1795-1800'' (1969).</ref>\n\n===Quasi War 1798\u20131800===\nTo overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\", which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |title=American Foreign Relations: A History, to 1920 |last=Paterson |first=Thomas G. |author2=Clifford, J.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the \"entangling\" French alliance with the United States.<ref>E.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights.

There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals.

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E.

Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine.\n\nA number of American artists, such as [[Josephine Baker]], experienced popular success in France. Paris was also quite welcoming to American [[jazz]] music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life.  Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

The successful performance of German warplanes during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) suddenly forced France to realize its military inferiority.  Germany had better warplanes,  more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange. In late 1937 he told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and asked for military help.

This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] as ambassador. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but it was helping Germany. The United States severed diplomatic relations in late 1942 when Germany took direct control of areas that Vichy had ruled, and Vichy France became a Nazi [[puppet state]].<ref>William L. Langer, ''Our Vichy Gamble'' (1947)</ref> More recently, Hurstfield (1986) concluded that Roosevelt, not the State Department, had made the decision, thereby deflecting criticism from leftwing elements of his coalition onto the hapless State Department.

After Normandy the Americans and the Allies knew it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give De Gaulle his word that Paris would be liberated by the French as the Americans had no interest in Paris, a city they considered lacking tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].

He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295.

After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million.

Johnson]], 1967]]\n\nWhile occasional tensions surfaced between the governments, the French public, except for the Communists, generally had a good opinion of the United States throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Despite some cultural friction, the United States was seen as a benevolent giant, the land of modernity, and French youth took a taste to American culture such as [[chewing gum]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[rock and roll]].\n\n===De Gaulle===\nIn the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. [[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Adult sea [[otter]]s typically weigh between {{convert|14|and|45|kg|abbr=on}}, making them the heaviest members of the [[Mustelidae|weasel family]], but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of [[fur]], the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean.\n\nThe sea otter inhabits nearshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to [[forage]]. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as [[sea urchin]]s, various [[mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s, and some species of [[fish]]. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its [[Tool use by sea otters|use of rocks]] to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a [[keystone species]], controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to [[kelp forest]] [[ecosystem]]s. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.\n\nSea otters, whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000\u2013300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, and the world population fell to 1,000\u20132,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range.<ref>{{cite report |title=The sea otter (Enhydra lutris): behavior, ecology, and natural history |last1=Riedman |first1=M.L. |last2=Estes |first2=James A. |authorlink2=James A.

Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that for thousands of years, [[indigenous peoples]] have hunted sea otters for food and fur.<ref name = silverstein34/> Large-scale hunting, part of the [[Maritime Fur Trade]], which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.<ref name = silverstein34/>\n\nIn the early 18th century, Russians began to hunt sea otters in the Kuril Islands<ref name=silverstein34>Silverstein, p. 34</ref> and sold them to the Chinese at [[Kyakhta]]. Russia was also exploring the far northern Pacific at this time, and sent [[Vitus Bering]] to map the Arctic coast and find routes from Siberia to North America.<ref name = silverstein35/> In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was shipwrecked off [[Bering Island]] in the [[Commander Islands]], where he and many of his crew died.<ref name = silverstein35/> The surviving crew members, which included naturalist [[Georg Steller]], discovered sea otters on the beaches of the island and spent the winter hunting sea otters and gambling with otter pelts.<ref name = silverstein35/> They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts.<ref name=silverstein35>Silverstein, p. 35</ref> Thus began what is sometimes called the \"Great Hunt\", which would continue for another hundred years. The Russians found the sea otter far more valuable than the [[sable]] skins that had driven and paid for most of their expansion across Siberia. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth the cost of Bering's expedition.<ref>James R Gibson, \"Feeding the Russian Fur Trade\",1969, page 17</ref> In 1775 at Okhotsk, sea otter pelts were worth 50\u201380 rubles as opposed to 2.5 rubles for sable.\n\n[[File:London Sea Otter pelt sales 1871-1910.svg|thumb|left|Pelt sales (in thousands) in the London fur market \u2013 the drop beginning in the 1880s reflects dwindling sea otter populations.<ref name=Brass>Brass E.

The Russians initially traded with the [[Aleut people|Aleuts]] inhabitants of these islands for otter pelts, but later enslaved the Aleuts, taking women and children hostage and torturing and killing Aleut men to force them to hunt.

Adult sea [[otter]]s typically weigh between {{convert|14|and|45|kg|abbr=on}}, making them the heaviest members of the [[Mustelidae|weasel family]], but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of [[fur]], the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean.\n\nThe sea otter inhabits nearshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to [[forage]]. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as [[sea urchin]]s, various [[mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s, and some species of [[fish]]. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its [[Tool use by sea otters|use of rocks]] to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a [[keystone species]], controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to [[kelp forest]] [[ecosystem]]s. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.\n\nSea otters, whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000\u2013300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, and the world population fell to 1,000\u20132,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range.<ref>{{cite report |title=The sea otter (Enhydra lutris): behavior, ecology, and natural history |last1=Riedman |first1=M.L. |last2=Estes |first2=James A. |authorlink2=James A.

The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in [[marine conservation]], although populations in the [[Aleutian Islands]] and [[California]] have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels.

Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that for thousands of years, [[indigenous peoples]] have hunted sea otters for food and fur.<ref name = silverstein34/> Large-scale hunting, part of the [[Maritime Fur Trade]], which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.<ref name = silverstein34/>\n\nIn the early 18th century, Russians began to hunt sea otters in the Kuril Islands<ref name=silverstein34>Silverstein, p. 34</ref> and sold them to the Chinese at [[Kyakhta]]. Russia was also exploring the far northern Pacific at this time, and sent [[Vitus Bering]] to map the Arctic coast and find routes from Siberia to North America.<ref name = silverstein35/> In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was shipwrecked off [[Bering Island]] in the [[Commander Islands]], where he and many of his crew died.<ref name = silverstein35/> The surviving crew members, which included naturalist [[Georg Steller]], discovered sea otters on the beaches of the island and spent the winter hunting sea otters and gambling with otter pelts.<ref name = silverstein35/> They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts.<ref name=silverstein35>Silverstein, p. 35</ref> Thus began what is sometimes called the \"Great Hunt\", which would continue for another hundred years. The Russians found the sea otter far more valuable than the [[sable]] skins that had driven and paid for most of their expansion across Siberia. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth the cost of Bering's expedition.<ref>James R Gibson, \"Feeding the Russian Fur Trade\",1969, page 17</ref> In 1775 at Okhotsk, sea otter pelts were worth 50\u201380 rubles as opposed to 2.5 rubles for sable.\n\n[[File:London Sea Otter pelt sales 1871-1910.svg|thumb|left|Pelt sales (in thousands) in the London fur market \u2013 the drop beginning in the 1880s reflects dwindling sea otter populations.<ref name=Brass>Brass E.

The Russians initially traded with the [[Aleut people|Aleuts]] inhabitants of these islands for otter pelts, but later enslaved the Aleuts, taking women and children hostage and torturing and killing Aleut men to force them to hunt.

In 1799, Emperor Paul I consolidated the rival fur-hunting companies into the [[Russian-American Company]], granting it an imperial charter and protection, and a monopoly over trade rights and territorial acquisition.\nUnder Aleksandr I, the administration of the merchant-controlled company was transferred to the Imperial Navy, largely due to the alarming reports by naval officers of native abuse; in 1818, the indigenous peoples of Alaska were granted civil rights equivalent to a townsman status in the Russian Empire.<ref name=Middleton8>Middleton, p. 8</ref>\n\nOther nations joined in the hunt in the south.

Between 1803 and 1846, 72 American ships were involved in the otter hunt in California, harvesting an estimated 40,000 skins and tails, compared to only 13 ships of the Russian-American Company, which reported 5,696 otter skins taken between 1806 and 1846.<ref name=Mathes326>Mathes, p. 326</ref> In 1812, the Russians founded an agricultural settlement at what is now [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] in northern California, as their southern headquarters.<ref name = silverstein38/>\nEventually, sea otter populations became so depleted, commercial hunting was no longer viable.
