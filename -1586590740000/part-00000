The size of the Special Operations Forces is estimated to be between 7,000 and 14,000 troops. The forces intended combat role is as rapid-response units in the event of a limited regional war under high-tech conditions. They also carry out commando, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering operations. \n\nThe building up of China's special forces represents a shift in the country's operational thinking, from an army-dominated force structure to emphasizing integrated joint operations, with a flexible elite force.\n\n== History ==\nThe PLA's interest in modern special warfare was first noted in the mid-1980s when it was shifting its military stance from a \"[[people's war]]\" to \"fighting a local war under hi-tech conditions.\" The PLA planners believed that the next war would be a short, fast-paced conflict on the periphery rather than a total war on Chinese territory, and that conventional [[infantry]]-orientated ground forces would no longer meet their requirements. Additionally, the PLA's combat experience from the [[Sino-Vietnamese War|1979 and 1980s border conflicts with Vietnam]], where Vietnamese [[special forces]] caused substantial trouble to the Chinese forces, demonstrated the value of special units.\n\nOn 23 December 2008, their first publicly known mission was to accompany three Chinese warships in protecting and escorting commercial ships against [[piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]], in cooperation with other nations as part of a UN mandate.<ref>[http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/China_ready_to_use_force_on_Somali_pirates120016822.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225103150/http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/China_ready_to_use_force_on_Somali_pirates120016822.php|date=December 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Special Operations Forces Units ==\n[[File:140716-G-HN254-571 (14714332244).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|People's Liberation Army Navy Special Forces]]\n\n* Beijing Military Region \u2013 \"Oriental Sword\".

Additionally, the PLA's combat experience from the [[Sino-Vietnamese War|1979 and 1980s border conflicts with Vietnam]], where Vietnamese [[special forces]] caused substantial trouble to the Chinese forces, demonstrated the value of special units.\n\nOn 23 December 2008, their first publicly known mission was to accompany three Chinese warships in protecting and escorting commercial ships against [[piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]], in cooperation with other nations as part of a UN mandate.<ref>[http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/China_ready_to_use_force_on_Somali_pirates120016822.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225103150/http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/China_ready_to_use_force_on_Somali_pirates120016822.php|date=December 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Special Operations Forces Units ==\n[[File:140716-G-HN254-571 (14714332244).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|People's Liberation Army Navy Special Forces]]\n\n* Beijing Military Region \u2013 \"Oriental Sword\".

It is situated at the mouth of the [[Mah\u00e9 River]] and is surrounded by the State of [[Kerala]]. The [[Kannur District]] surrounds Mah\u00e9 on three sides and [[Kozhikode District]] from one side.\n\nFormerly part of [[French India]], Mah\u00e9 now forms a municipality in [[Mah\u00e9 district]], one of the four districts of the [[Union Territory]] of [[Puducherry]]. Mah\u00e9 has one [[Member of Legislative Assembly|representative]] in the [[Puducherry Legislative Assembly]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Mah\u00e9'' derives from  ''Mayyazhi'', the name given to the local river and region in the [[Malayalam]] language. The original spelling found on French documents from the early 1720s is ''May\u00e9'', with ''Mah\u00e9'' and ''Mahi\u00e9'' also found on documents, maps and geographical dictionaries until the early 19th century when the spelling Mah\u00e9 became the norm. Therefore, the belief that the name of the town was given in honour of [[Bertrand Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] (1699\u20131753), whose later fame derived in good part from his association with India, including his capture of May\u00e9 in 1741, is incorrect.<ref>H. Castonnet des Fosses, \"L\u2019Inde avant Dupleix\", ''Revue de l\u2019Anjou'', Angers, July\u2013August 1886, p. 91, note 1.</ref>\n\nAnother claim that the spelling Mah\u00e9 was officially adopted by the leader of the expedition that retook the city in 1726 in recognition of La Bourdonnais' role at the time is also unlikely.<ref>The detailed accounts of the expedition barely mention young La Bourdonnais' role.</ref> It is probable that the resemblance of May\u00e9, not to mention Mah\u00e9, with La Bourdonnais' family name prompted later generations to assume that the famous Frenchman was somehow directly or indirectly associated with the name to the town or the spelling of the name.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|French India}}\nBefore the incursion of European colonial powers into [[India]], this area was part of Kolathu Nadu which comprised Thulunadu, [[Chirakkal, Kannur|Chirakkal]] and Kadathanadu. The [[French East India Company]] constructed a fort on the site of Mah\u00e9 in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between Andr\u00e9 Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of [[Vatakara]] three years earlier. In 1741, Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a short period of occupation by the [[Maratha]]s.\n\nIn 1761 the British captured Mah\u00e9, and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mah\u00e9. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mah\u00e9 was handed over to the French in 1785.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|title=History of Mah\u00e9|accessdate=28 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232052/http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan de Mahe avec les attaques de Bayanor souverain du lieu.jpg|thumb|300px|Mah\u00e9 in 1726. Map made after taking possession of the place and the war against the Indian king of the region supported by the British]]\nOn the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793, a British force under [[James Hartley (Indian Army officer)|James Hartley]] captured Mah\u00e9. In 1816 the British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, after the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Mayyazhi remained under French jurisdiction as a small French colony, an enclave within [[British Raj|British India]], during the long span that began in 1816. After the [[Independence of India]] the area continued to be French-ruled until 13 June 1954, when a long anti-colonial struggle culminated in its joining the Indian Union (see [[Causes for liberation of French colonies in India]]).\n\nAfter the French left, Mah\u00e9 became a district of [[Puducherry]] Union Territory.

It is situated at the mouth of the [[Mah\u00e9 River]] and is surrounded by the State of [[Kerala]]. The [[Kannur District]] surrounds Mah\u00e9 on three sides and [[Kozhikode District]] from one side.\n\nFormerly part of [[French India]], Mah\u00e9 now forms a municipality in [[Mah\u00e9 district]], one of the four districts of the [[Union Territory]] of [[Puducherry]]. Mah\u00e9 has one [[Member of Legislative Assembly|representative]] in the [[Puducherry Legislative Assembly]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Mah\u00e9'' derives from  ''Mayyazhi'', the name given to the local river and region in the [[Malayalam]] language. The original spelling found on French documents from the early 1720s is ''May\u00e9'', with ''Mah\u00e9'' and ''Mahi\u00e9'' also found on documents, maps and geographical dictionaries until the early 19th century when the spelling Mah\u00e9 became the norm. Therefore, the belief that the name of the town was given in honour of [[Bertrand Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] (1699\u20131753), whose later fame derived in good part from his association with India, including his capture of May\u00e9 in 1741, is incorrect.<ref>H. Castonnet des Fosses, \"L\u2019Inde avant Dupleix\", ''Revue de l\u2019Anjou'', Angers, July\u2013August 1886, p. 91, note 1.</ref>\n\nAnother claim that the spelling Mah\u00e9 was officially adopted by the leader of the expedition that retook the city in 1726 in recognition of La Bourdonnais' role at the time is also unlikely.<ref>The detailed accounts of the expedition barely mention young La Bourdonnais' role.</ref> It is probable that the resemblance of May\u00e9, not to mention Mah\u00e9, with La Bourdonnais' family name prompted later generations to assume that the famous Frenchman was somehow directly or indirectly associated with the name to the town or the spelling of the name.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|French India}}\nBefore the incursion of European colonial powers into [[India]], this area was part of Kolathu Nadu which comprised Thulunadu, [[Chirakkal, Kannur|Chirakkal]] and Kadathanadu. The [[French East India Company]] constructed a fort on the site of Mah\u00e9 in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between Andr\u00e9 Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of [[Vatakara]] three years earlier. In 1741, Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a short period of occupation by the [[Maratha]]s.\n\nIn 1761 the British captured Mah\u00e9, and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mah\u00e9. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mah\u00e9 was handed over to the French in 1785.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|title=History of Mah\u00e9|accessdate=28 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232052/http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan de Mahe avec les attaques de Bayanor souverain du lieu.jpg|thumb|300px|Mah\u00e9 in 1726.

In 1816 the British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, after the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Mayyazhi remained under French jurisdiction as a small French colony, an enclave within [[British Raj|British India]], during the long span that began in 1816. After the [[Independence of India]] the area continued to be French-ruled until 13 June 1954, when a long anti-colonial struggle culminated in its joining the Indian Union (see [[Causes for liberation of French colonies in India]]).\n\nAfter the French left, Mah\u00e9 became a district of [[Puducherry]] Union Territory. The area of Mah\u00e9 begins from Mayyazhi puzha in the north to Azhiyoor at the south. Mah\u00e9 consists of Mah\u00e9 town and Naluthara, which includes four villages: Pandakkal, Pallur, Chalakara and Chembra.

It was designed by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]]. The [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]] wanted a [[commemorative coin]] to mark its centennial that year. Legislation for such a coin passed through Congress without opposition, and was signed on March 4, 1921 by President [[Warren G. Harding]] on his [[Inauguration of Warren G. Harding|inauguration day]]. The federal [[Commission of Fine Arts]] hired Aitken to design the coin, which depicted [[Daniel Boone]] on both sides.  The reverse design, showing Boone with a Native American, was likely intended to symbolize the displacement of the Indians by white settlers.\n\nTo increase sales, a portion of the issue was produced with the mark 2\u26054, symbolic of Missouri being the 24th state. Although admired for the design, the coins did not sell as well as hoped, and almost 60 percent were returned to the [[Philadelphia Mint]] for melting. There are fewer coins with 2\u26054 than without, but they remain near-equal in value.\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe State of Missouri, admitted to [[United States of America|the Union]] in 1821 as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], wanted a commemorative coin for sale at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] from August 8 to 20, 1921.{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} Legislation for such a half dollar was introduced in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by that state's [[Selden P.

Marshall]], who was presiding over the Senate, asked if there was objection to its passage.  The Minority Leader, Democrat [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama, said he did not think there would be objection, but that the bill should be read first.  Idaho Senator [[William E. Borah]] stated he would object if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had [[morning business]] in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan.

Moore replied on February 2, advising that one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin be hired, and that the resulting work be subjected to the friendly criticism of other artists.  Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a \"[[Covered wagon|prairie-schooner]]&nbsp;... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] [[Daniel Boone|Boone]] and [early Missouri politician Thomas Hart] [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]]; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward\".{{sfn|Taxay|pp=52\u201353}} The hired sculptor could choose among these concepts, Moore suggested, and decide which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a \"standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures '24' in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory.\"{{sfn|Taxay|pp=53, 56}}<!-- 54 and 55 are pictures -->\n\nMontgomery also proposed that a star with the number \"24\" (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck.  These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, an expense estimated at $1,750.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}} Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words \"<small>MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921</small>\" appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}}\n\nThe Fine Arts Commission hired [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]], a sculptor best known in numismatic circles for his design for the $50 [[Panama-Pacific commemorative coins|Panama Pacific gold pieces]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} This was apparently not communicated to the Missouri commission as on May 17, [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], a member of the Fine Arts Commission, told Moore that he had heard that someone associated with the Missouri Centennial had made inquiries with the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, aimed at hiring a sculptor.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}}  Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear, but he wrote to Spencer on May 26, advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved.  CFA members had suggested several changes; these were implemented and, on June 9, the CFA approved the design, a decision communicated by letter that day to the [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]], [[Raymond T. Baker]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=56\u201358}} To speed production, the Medallic Art Company produced [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]] from Aitken's plaster models, from which working dies to strike the coins could be made.{{sfn|Bowers|p=154}} These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29, 1921.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}}\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Unfinished portrait of Daniel Boone by Chester Harding 1820.jpg|thumb|upright|The obverse depicts [[Daniel Boone]], shown here in an unfinished portrait by Chester Harding]]\n\nThe bust of frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], who lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life, appears on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, note speculation that the obverse may have been inspired by [[Albin Polasek]]'s sculptured bust of Boone in the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a [[coonskin cap]]. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American\u2014Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and [[peace pipe]], apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri; Breen stated \"as though this was something to brag about\".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=163\u2013164}} The 1921 ''Report of the Director of the Mint'' describes the interaction as \"Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man\".{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which shows Boone on either side, is one of the few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides; other such depictions include Boone himself on the 1934\u20131938 [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] on the 1900-dated [[Lafayette dollar]] and the frontiersman on the 1936 [[Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=156}}\n\nThe 24 stars on the reverse convey the same message that the 2\u26054 on the obverse of some specimens does\u2014that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name <small>[[Sedalia, Missouri|SEDALIA]]</small>, the site of the centennial exposition, appears in [[exergue]]. Aitken's stylized monogram, <small>RA</small>, is near the rifle butt.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}} The Missouri piece, and the [[Columbian half dollar]] of 1892\u20131893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is <small>LIBERTY</small>, <small>IN GOD WE TRUST</small> and <small>E PLURIBUS UNUM</small>.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=46}} The design was liked at the time of issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Missouri Centennial Half Dollar a Popular Coin|pages=484\u2013485|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=October 1921}}</ref>\n\nArt historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken \"became the first American medalist to apply the principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand \"like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} Vermeule noted that \"the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello\" and that \"the coin as a whole is a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} The author concluded of Aitken's works, \"his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=163}}\n\n== Production, distribution, and collecting ==\n[[File:Original Aitken Design for Missouri Centennial half dollar.jpeg|thumb|left|Portion of advertisement for the half dollar (1921), showing a reverse design not used by Aitken]]\n\nA total of 50,028 Missouri Centennial half dollars was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in July 1921, 28 being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=124}} The first coins displayed the 2\u26054 on the obverse; afterwards, this was ground off the dies and the remainder were struck without it.  The Sedalia Trust Company distributed the coins at a price of $1 on behalf of the centennial commission, selling both varieties by mail and the plain ones at the exposition in August.  There had been little advance publicity, and the exposition took place during the [[Recession of 1921]]. All of the 2\u26054 coins sold, but when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}}{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state [[Seal of Missouri]], that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well.<ref name = \"num1221\" /> Aitken, in a letter published in part in the December 1921 issue of ''[[The Numismatist]]'' (the journal of the [[American Numismatic Association]]) wrote that \"The illustration that you published was made from one of several drawings which I submitted to the Federal Art Commission. The Missouri committee was informed that I would work along these lines, though I was given full latitude for any change I might advise. The seal of the State did not work out well, so I developed the reverse with the two standing figures, which met with the instant approval of the Commission in Washington.\"<ref name = \"num1221\">{{cite journal|title=A 'Variety' of the Missouri Centennial Half Dollar|page=575|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=December 1921}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Missouri ad May 1922 Numismatist.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|May 1922 advertisement for the 2\u26054 coins, with the design as issued]]\n\nThe number of coins bearing the 2\u26054 is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen wrote that 5,000 were struck and were sold, meaning that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}} Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, adhered to these figures.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Coin dealer David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2\u26054 were issued, with which numismatic writer [[Q. David Bowers]] concurred, noting that the two varieties are about equal in rarity.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=155\u2013156}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, estimates that 9,400 of the 2\u26054 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1058}} Both varieties sold at a premium above the issue price by 1925, and at the height of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 2\u26054 sold for $25 and the plain for $28.  By 1940, the 2\u26054 sold for more than the plain, and at the height of the second boom in 1980, the 2\u26054 brought $2,600 to the plain's $2,400.

It was designed by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]]. The [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]] wanted a [[commemorative coin]] to mark its centennial that year. Legislation for such a coin passed through Congress without opposition, and was signed on March 4, 1921 by President [[Warren G. Harding]] on his [[Inauguration of Warren G. Harding|inauguration day]]. The federal [[Commission of Fine Arts]] hired Aitken to design the coin, which depicted [[Daniel Boone]] on both sides.  The reverse design, showing Boone with a Native American, was likely intended to symbolize the displacement of the Indians by white settlers.\n\nTo increase sales, a portion of the issue was produced with the mark 2\u26054, symbolic of Missouri being the 24th state. Although admired for the design, the coins did not sell as well as hoped, and almost 60 percent were returned to the [[Philadelphia Mint]] for melting. There are fewer coins with 2\u26054 than without, but they remain near-equal in value.\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe State of Missouri, admitted to [[United States of America|the Union]] in 1821 as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], wanted a commemorative coin for sale at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] from August 8 to 20, 1921.{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} Legislation for such a half dollar was introduced in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by that state's [[Selden P.

Marshall]], who was presiding over the Senate, asked if there was objection to its passage.  The Minority Leader, Democrat [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama, said he did not think there would be objection, but that the bill should be read first.  Idaho Senator [[William E. Borah]] stated he would object if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had [[morning business]] in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan.

Moore replied on February 2, advising that one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin be hired, and that the resulting work be subjected to the friendly criticism of other artists.  Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a \"[[Covered wagon|prairie-schooner]]&nbsp;... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] [[Daniel Boone|Boone]] and [early Missouri politician Thomas Hart] [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]]; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward\".{{sfn|Taxay|pp=52\u201353}} The hired sculptor could choose among these concepts, Moore suggested, and decide which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a \"standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures '24' in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory.\"{{sfn|Taxay|pp=53, 56}}<!-- 54 and 55 are pictures -->\n\nMontgomery also proposed that a star with the number \"24\" (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck.  These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, an expense estimated at $1,750.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}} Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words \"<small>MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921</small>\" appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}}\n\nThe Fine Arts Commission hired [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]], a sculptor best known in numismatic circles for his design for the $50 [[Panama-Pacific commemorative coins|Panama Pacific gold pieces]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} This was apparently not communicated to the Missouri commission as on May 17, [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], a member of the Fine Arts Commission, told Moore that he had heard that someone associated with the Missouri Centennial had made inquiries with the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, aimed at hiring a sculptor.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}}  Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear, but he wrote to Spencer on May 26, advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved.  CFA members had suggested several changes; these were implemented and, on June 9, the CFA approved the design, a decision communicated by letter that day to the [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]], [[Raymond T. Baker]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=56\u201358}} To speed production, the Medallic Art Company produced [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]] from Aitken's plaster models, from which working dies to strike the coins could be made.{{sfn|Bowers|p=154}} These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29, 1921.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}}\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Unfinished portrait of Daniel Boone by Chester Harding 1820.jpg|thumb|upright|The obverse depicts [[Daniel Boone]], shown here in an unfinished portrait by Chester Harding]]\n\nThe bust of frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], who lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life, appears on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, note speculation that the obverse may have been inspired by [[Albin Polasek]]'s sculptured bust of Boone in the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a [[coonskin cap]]. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American\u2014Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and [[peace pipe]], apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri; Breen stated \"as though this was something to brag about\".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=163\u2013164}} The 1921 ''Report of the Director of the Mint'' describes the interaction as \"Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man\".{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which shows Boone on either side, is one of the few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides; other such depictions include Boone himself on the 1934\u20131938 [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] on the 1900-dated [[Lafayette dollar]] and the frontiersman on the 1936 [[Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=156}}\n\nThe 24 stars on the reverse convey the same message that the 2\u26054 on the obverse of some specimens does\u2014that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name <small>[[Sedalia, Missouri|SEDALIA]]</small>, the site of the centennial exposition, appears in [[exergue]]. Aitken's stylized monogram, <small>RA</small>, is near the rifle butt.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}} The Missouri piece, and the [[Columbian half dollar]] of 1892\u20131893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is <small>LIBERTY</small>, <small>IN GOD WE TRUST</small> and <small>E PLURIBUS UNUM</small>.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=46}} The design was liked at the time of issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Missouri Centennial Half Dollar a Popular Coin|pages=484\u2013485|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=October 1921}}</ref>\n\nArt historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken \"became the first American medalist to apply the principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand \"like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} Mermeule noted that \"the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello\" and that \"the coin as a whole is a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} The author concluded of Aitken's works, \"his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=163}}\n\n== Production, distribution, and collecting ==\n[[File:Original Aitken Design for Missouri Centennial half dollar.jpeg|thumb|left|Portion of advertisement for the half dollar (1921), showing a reverse design not used by Aitken]]\n\nA total of 50,028 Missouri Centennial half dollars was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in July 1921, 28 being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=124}} The first coins displayed the 2\u26054 on the obverse; afterwards, this was ground off the dies and the remainder were struck without it.  The Sedalia Trust Company distributed the coins at a price of $1 on behalf of the centennial commission, selling both varieties by mail and the plain ones at the exposition in August.  There had been little advance publicity, and the exposition took place during the [[Recession of 1921]]. All of the 2\u26054 coins sold, but when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}}{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state [[Seal of Missouri]], that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well.<ref name = \"num1221\" /> Aitken, in a letter published in part in the December 1921 issue of ''[[The Numismatist]]'' (the journal of the [[American Numismatic Association]]) wrote that \"The illustration that you published was made from one of several drawings which I submitted to the Federal Art Commission. The Missouri committee was informed that I would work along these lines, though I was given full latitude for any change I might advise. The seal of the State did not work out well, so I developed the reverse with the two standing figures, which met with the instant approval of the Commission in Washington.\"<ref name = \"num1221\">{{cite journal|title=A 'Variety' of the Missouri Centennial Half Dollar|page=575|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=December 1921}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Missouri ad May 1922 Numismatist.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|May 1922 advertisement for the 2\u26054 coins, with the design as issued]]\n\nThe number of coins bearing the 2\u26054 is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen wrote that 5,000 were struck and were sold, meaning that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=164}} Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, adhered to these figures.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Coin dealer David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2\u26054 were issued, with which numismatic writer [[Q. David Bowers]] concurred, noting that the two varieties are about equal in rarity.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=155\u2013156}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, estimates that 9,400 of the 2\u26054 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1058}} Both varieties sold at a premium above the issue price by 1925, and at the height of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 2\u26054 sold for $25 and the plain for $28.  By 1940, the 2\u26054 sold for more than the plain, and at the height of the second boom in 1980, the 2\u26054 brought $2,600 to the plain's $2,400. Yeoman's book lists the 2\u26054 for between $625 and $7,250, and the plain for between $400 and $6,650, each depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1059}} An exceptional specimen of the plain variety sold at auction in 2015 for $70,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1921-missouri-50c-ms-coinid-19330|title=1921 Missouri 50C MS|publisher=Numismatic Guaranty Corporation|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref> At least one specimen in proof condition is known, sold at auction in 1992.<ref name=\"Stevenson\">{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Jed|title=COINS; Mix-Up and Mystery: The 1921 Missouri Proof|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/style/coins-mix-up-and-mystery-the-1921-missouri-proof.html|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 2, 1992}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

It is an important species to both the commercial and recreational [[fishing]] industries.\n\n==Description==\nThe king mackerel is a medium-sized fish, typically encountered from 5 to {{convert|14|kg|abbr=on|-1}}, but is known to exceed {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on|-1}}.  The entire body is covered with very small, hardly visible, loosely attached scales. The first (spiny) [[dorsal fin]] is entirely colorless and is normally folded back into a body groove, as are the [[pelvic fin]]s. The [[lateral line]] starts high on the shoulder, dips abruptly at mid-body and then continues as a wavy horizontal line to the tail. Coloration is olive on the back, fading to silver with a rosy iridescence on the sides, fading to white on the belly.  Fish under {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on|-1}} show yellowish-brown spots on the flanks, somewhat smaller than the spots of the [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus maculatus''. Its cutting-edged teeth are large, uniform, closely spaced and flattened from side to side. These teeth look very similar to those of the [[bluefish]], ''Pomatomus saltatrix''.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe king mackerel is a subtropical species of the Atlantic Coast of the Americas. Common in the coastal zone from [[North Carolina]] to [[Brazil]], it occurs as far south as [[Rio de Janeiro]], and occasionally as far north as the [[Gulf of Maine]] and also found in Eastern coast of India, in the [[Bay of Bengal]], [[Indian Ocean]] and Western coast of India in the [[Arabian Sea]]. Nonetheless, a preference for water temperatures in the range of {{convert|20|to|29|C|abbr=on}} may limit distribution.\n\nKing mackerel commonly occur in depths of {{convert|12|\u2013|45|m|abbr=on|-1}}, where the principal fisheries occur. Larger kings (heavier than 9&nbsp;kg or 20&nbsp;lb) often occur inshore, in the mouths of inlets and harbors, and occasionally even at the {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} depths at the edge of the [[Gulf Stream]].\n\n==Migration patterns==\n[[File:King Mackerel.JPG|thumb|right|A male king mackerel, about {{convert|6|kg|abbr=on}}.]]\nAt least two migratory groups of king mackerel have been found to exist off the American coast.  A [[Gulf of Mexico]] group ranges from the [[Texas]] coast in summer to the middle-east coast of [[Florida]] from November through March. Spawning occurs throughout the summer off the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nAn Atlantic group is abundant off North Carolina in spring and fall. This group migrates to southeast Florida, where it spawns from May through August, and slowly returns through summer. Apparently, this group winters in deep water off the Carolinas, as tagging studies have shown they are never found off Florida in winter.\n\n==Life history==\nEggs and sperm are shed into the sea and their union is by chance. Depending on size, a female may shed from 50,000 to several million eggs over the spawning season. Fertilized eggs hatch in about 24 hours. The newly hatched larva is about {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long with a large yolk sack. Little is known about king mackerel in their first year of life. Yearling fish typically attain an average weight of {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.8|kg|abbr=on}} and a [[fork length]] of {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}. At age seven, females average {{convert|10|kg|abbr=on}}, males {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on}}. King mackerel may attain {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}}, but any over {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} is almost certainly a female.\n\n==Feeding habits==\nKing mackerel are voracious, opportunistic carnivores. Their prey depends on their size. Depending on area and season, they favor squid, [[menhaden]] and other [[sardine]]-like fish ([[Clupeidae]]), jacks ([[Carangidae]]), [[cutlassfish]] ([[Trichiuridae]]), [[weakfish]] ([[Sciaenidae]]), grunts ([[Haemulidae]]), striped anchovies ([[Engraulidae]]), cigar minnows, threadfin, northern mackerel, and [[blue runners]].  They do not attack humans but will defend themselves against perceived threats, including humans flailing or thrashing in [[Man overboard|man-overboard]] and similar situations, by biting.\n\n==Fisheries==\n[[File:Fisheries capture of Scomberomorus cavalla.png|thumb|400px|left|<center>Commercial capture of king mackerel in tonnes from 1950 to 2009</center>]]\n\n===Fishing gear and methods===\nKing mackerel are among the most sought-after gamefish throughout their range from North Carolina to Texas. Known throughout the sportfishing world for their blistering runs, the king mackerel matches its distant relative, the wahoo, in speed.\nThey are taken mostly by trolling, using various live and dead baitfish, spoons, jigs and other artificial lures.  Commercial gear consists of run-around gill nets. They are also taken commercially by trolling with large planers, heavy tackle and lures similar to those used by sport fishers. Typically when using live bait, two hooks are tied to a strong metal leader. The first may be a treble or single and is hooked through the live bait's nose and/or mouth. The second hook (treble hook) is placed through the top of the fish's back or allowed to swing free. This must be done because king mackerel commonly bite the tail section of a bait fish. When trolling for kings using this method, it is important to make sure the baitfish are swimming properly.  Typical tackle includes a conventional or spinning reel capable of holding {{convert|340|m|yd|abbr=on}} of {{convert|13|kg|abbr=on}} test monofilament and a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}, {{convert|13|kg|abbr=on}} class rod.\n\nSeveral organizations have found success in promoting tournament events for this species because of their popularity as a sport fish.  The most notable are the Southern Kingfish Association (SKA) and the FLW Outdoors tour. These events are covered in several outdoors publications, both in print and online.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==As food==\n\n===Processing===\nAs of 2005, king mackerel are primarily marketed fresh. They may be sold as fillets, steaks, or in the round (whole). Their raw flesh is grayish, due to its high fat content. They are best prepared by grilling, frying, baking or, especially for large \"smoker\" king, by smoking.\n\n===Nutrition===\n{{main article|Mercury in fish}}\nAccording to the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], king mackerel is one of four fishes, along with [[swordfish]], [[shark]], and [[tilefish]], that children and pregnant women should avoid due to high levels of [[methylmercury]] found in these fish and the consequent risk of [[Mercury poisoning#Organic mercury compounds|mercury poisoning]].<ref name=\"FDA\">[https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/buystoreservesafefood/ucm110591.htm Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish (1990-2010)]. [[United States Food and Drug Administration]]. Retrieved September, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Similar species==\nSmall king mackerel are similar in appearance to [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus maculatus'', and [[cero mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus regalis'', all three species being similar in shape and coloration. They may be distinguished as follows:\n\nThe lateral line on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero slopes gradually from the top edge of the gill to the tail. In contrast, that of the king mackerel takes an abrupt drop at mid-body (see illustration).\n\nThe first (spiny) dorsal fin on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero has a prominent black patch. The king mackerel does not. As all three species normally keep the first dorsal folded back in a body groove, this difference is not immediately evident.\n\nAtlantic Spanish mackerel have prominent yellow spots on the flanks at all sizes. In addition to such spots, cero have one or more yellow stripes along the centerline. Young king mackerel have similar, but slightly smaller spots,  these fade away on individuals weighing over {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on|-1}}, but may still be seen as slightly darker green spots toward the back from some angles of view.\n\nWorldwide, many fish of these three species are quite similar to one or another. Off Mexico, Atlantic Spanish mackerel may be confused with [[Serra Spanish mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus brasiliensis''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{ITIS |id=172435 |taxon=Scomberomorus cavalla |accessdate=11 March 2006}}\n* {{FishBase species|genus=Scomberomorus|species=cavalla|year=2005|month=November}}\n* [http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/mackerel/species_pages/king_mackerel.htm King mackerel ] ''NOAA FishWatch''.

Known throughout the sportfishing world for their blistering runs, the king mackerel matches its distant relative, the wahoo, in speed.\nThey are taken mostly by trolling, using various live and dead baitfish, spoons, jigs and other artificial lures.  Commercial gear consists of run-around gill nets. They are also taken commercially by trolling with large planers, heavy tackle and lures similar to those used by sport fishers. Typically when using live bait, two hooks are tied to a strong metal leader. The first may be a treble or single and is hooked through the live bait's nose and/or mouth. The second hook (treble hook) is placed through the top of the fish's back or allowed to swing free. This must be done because king mackerel commonly bite the tail section of a bait fish. When trolling for kings using this method, it is important to make sure the baitfish are swimming properly.  Typical tackle includes a conventional or spinning reel capable of holding {{convert|340|m|yd|abbr=on}} of {{convert|13|kg|abbr=on}} test monofilament and a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}, {{convert|13|kg|abbr=on}} class rod.\n\nSeveral organizations have found success in promoting tournament events for this species because of their popularity as a sport fish.  The most notable are the Southern Kingfish Association (SKA) and the FLW Outdoors tour. These events are covered in several outdoors publications, both in print and online.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==As food==\n\n===Processing===\nAs of 2005, king mackerel are primarily marketed fresh. They may be sold as fillets, steaks, or in the round (whole). Their raw flesh is grayish, due to its high fat content. They are best prepared by grilling, frying, baking or, especially for large \"smoker\" king, by smoking.\n\n===Nutrition===\n{{main article|Mercury in fish}}\nAccording to the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], king mackerel is one of four fishes, along with [[swordfish]], [[shark]], and [[tilefish]], that children and pregnant women should avoid due to high levels of [[methylmercury]] found in these fish and the consequent risk of [[Mercury poisoning#Organic mercury compounds|mercury poisoning]].<ref name=\"FDA\">[https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/buystoreservesafefood/ucm110591.htm Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish (1990-2010)]. [[United States Food and Drug Administration]]. Retrieved September, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Similar species==\nSmall king mackerel are similar in appearance to [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus maculatus'', and [[cero mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus regalis'', all three species being similar in shape and coloration. They may be distinguished as follows:\n\nThe lateral line on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero slopes gradually from the top edge of the gill to the tail. In contrast, that of the king mackerel takes an abrupt drop at mid-body (see illustration).\n\nThe first (spiny) dorsal fin on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero has a prominent black patch. The king mackerel does not. As all three species normally keep the first dorsal folded back in a body groove, this difference is not immediately evident.\n\nAtlantic Spanish mackerel have prominent yellow spots on the flanks at all sizes. In addition to such spots, cero have one or more yellow stripes along the centerline. Young king mackerel have similar, but slightly smaller spots,  these fade away on individuals weighing over {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on|-1}}, but may still be seen as slightly darker green spots toward the back from some angles of view.\n\nWorldwide, many fish of these three species are quite similar to one or another. Off Mexico, Atlantic Spanish mackerel may be confused with [[Serra Spanish mackerel]], ''Scomberomorus brasiliensis''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{ITIS |id=172435 |taxon=Scomberomorus cavalla |accessdate=11 March 2006}}\n* {{FishBase species|genus=Scomberomorus|species=cavalla|year=2005|month=November}}\n* [http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/mackerel/species_pages/king_mackerel.htm King mackerel ] ''NOAA FishWatch''.

In 2019, Fernando stood down as CEO of [[Dilmah]], as his son, Dilhan, was appointed the new head of the company.\n\n==Early life==\nFernando was born in [[Negombo#Zones and neighborhood|Pallansena]], [[Negombo]], [[British Ceylon]] in 1930. Fernando attended [[Maris Stella College]] in Negombo and [[Saint Joseph's College, Colombo]] in his youth. His first job was as a inspector for a U.S. petroleum company.<ref name=\"Fernando\" /> \n\n==Career==\nFernando was one of the first Sri Lankan tea tasters to be selected to learn about tea in Mincing Lane, London. Up until this time, the prevailing colonial system did not believe Sri Lankans were capable of assessing tea as they felt they ate too much curry which would affect their assessment of the taste. However, Fernando was one of five who were selected and trained in London.<ref>http://www.asianenterprise.biz/merrill-fernando-beyond-the-tea-garden/full.html</ref>\n\nIt was in London that Fernando witnessed a system of colonial exploitation that treated tea producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.<ref>http://fridaymagazine.ae/features/people/friday-talks-to-dilmah-s-founder-merrill-fernando-1.1978304</ref> This greatly disturbed Fernando, who dreamed that someday he would create his own brand of tea where the producing country would receive all profits from value addition and thereby get their due recognition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706234049/http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |archive-date=2013-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He wanted to bring integrity back into tea.<ref>http://gulfbusiness.com/pictures-new-luxury-tea-lounge-opens-in-dubai/</ref><ref>http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile-detail.aspx?profile=mfernando</ref>  With this intention he became, quite literally, the \u201cface\u201d of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets around the world as he urged people: \u201cDo try it.\u201d He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in [[antioxidants]] and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh handpicked and packed at its origin. Fernando strongly believed that consumers had the right to know exactly what they were drinking and so he pioneered the concept of single origin [[tea]].<ref>http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/Sri%20Lanka/Case%20study%201.pdf</ref>\n\n==Charity work==\nFernando believes in the philosophy of seeing business as a matter of human service. 10% of all [[Dilmah]] profits are channelled to the MJF Charitable Foundation <ref>http://www.mjffoundation.org</ref> which is working towards the dignified empowerment of underprivileged people around Sri Lanka.<ref>http://www.dilmahtea.com/tea-inspired-ebooks/free/business_is_matter_of_human_service/index.html</ref>\nEach year, the foundation cares for over 5,000 children in its Child Development Centres, nurtures over 1000 children through the MJF Kids, empowers women, and has created over 600 entrepreneurs through the Small Entrepreneur Programme \u2013 SEP\u2013 and uplifted the lives of countless plantation workers.

The Dilmah Conservation initiative aims to foster respect for the environment and ensure its protection by encouraging a harmonious co-existence of man and nature.<ref>http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Tea-veteran-wants-plantation-industry-out-of-State-control--136040.html</ref> In 2010, Fernando made a Declaration of a Core Commitment to Sustainability which expanded the Dilmah Conservation scope and scale to include initiatives in the areas of Habitat & Species Conservation \u2013 both terrestrial and marine, Ecosystems Restoration, Environmental Education and Culture & Indigenous Communities.<ref>http://businessforpeace.no/meet-the-winners-merrill-joseph-fernando/</ref> In 2016, The Merrill J.

Merrill with over 70 years of expertise in tea has the distinction of being the most experienced teamaker in the world today. In 2005, Dilmah received an award from the Medinge Group for its work as a Brand with a Conscience and also received a Presidential Merit Award for contribution to the preservation of the environment in the same year. On the 6th of May 2015, Fernando received the Business for Peace Award in Oslo, Norway.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150412/business-times/dilmahs-merril-j-selected-as-oslo-business-for-peace-2015-honouree-143728.html</ref>  The [[Business for Peace Foundation]] annually names honourees for the Oslo Business for Peace Award in recognition of business persons who, through their own actions and commitments truly are business worthy, promoting socially responsible and ethical business practice in an outstanding way, and standing out as examples to the world.<ref>http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Speeches/2015/Oslo-Business-for-Peace-Awards/</ref> In September 2016 Merrill was honoured with the Global Businessman Award at the [[Ada Derana]] Sri Lankan of the Year 2016.

However, Fernando was one of five who were selected and trained in London.<ref>http://www.asianenterprise.biz/merrill-fernando-beyond-the-tea-garden/full.html</ref>\n\nIt was in London that Fernando witnessed a system of colonial exploitation that treated tea producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.<ref>http://fridaymagazine.ae/features/people/friday-talks-to-dilmah-s-founder-merrill-fernando-1.1978304</ref> This greatly disturbed Fernando, who dreamed that someday he would create his own brand of tea where the producing country would receive all profits from value addition and thereby get their due recognition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706234049/http://www.brw.com.au/p/business/dilmah_founder_draws_on_years_of_g1hQG6vcpiNGvCRgh47ZgM |archive-date=2013-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He wanted to bring integrity back into tea.<ref>http://gulfbusiness.com/pictures-new-luxury-tea-lounge-opens-in-dubai/</ref><ref>http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile-detail.aspx?profile=mfernando</ref>  With this intention he became, quite literally, the \u201cface\u201d of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets around the world as he urged people: \u201cDo try it.\u201d He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in [[antioxidants]] and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh handpicked and packed at its origin. Fernando strongly believed that consumers had the right to know exactly what they were drinking and so he pioneered the concept of single origin [[tea]].<ref>http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/Sri%20Lanka/Case%20study%201.pdf</ref>\n\n==Charity work==\nFernando believes in the philosophy of seeing business as a matter of human service. 10% of all [[Dilmah]] profits are channelled to the MJF Charitable Foundation <ref>http://www.mjffoundation.org</ref> which is working towards the dignified empowerment of underprivileged people around Sri Lanka.<ref>http://www.dilmahtea.com/tea-inspired-ebooks/free/business_is_matter_of_human_service/index.html</ref>\nEach year, the foundation cares for over 5,000 children in its Child Development Centres, nurtures over 1000 children through the MJF Kids, empowers women, and has created over 600 entrepreneurs through the Small Entrepreneur Programme \u2013 SEP\u2013 and uplifted the lives of countless plantation workers. These are only a few of over 100 projects the MJF Foundation implements each year.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170226/business-times/empower-culinary-hospitality-school-receives-prestigious-worldchefs-certification-229949.html</ref><ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/600891/Empower-Culinary-and-Hospitality-School-receives-prestigious-World-Chefs-certification</ref>\n\n==Sustainability==\nIn 2007, Fernando extended his commitment to human service by establishing Dilmah Conservation www.dilmahconservation.org which focuses on working towards a more sustainable use of the environment in partnership with IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Dilmah Conservation initiative aims to foster respect for the environment and ensure its protection by encouraging a harmonious co-existence of man and nature.<ref>http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Tea-veteran-wants-plantation-industry-out-of-State-control--136040.html</ref> In 2010, Fernando made a Declaration of a Core Commitment to Sustainability which expanded the Dilmah Conservation scope and scale to include initiatives in the areas of Habitat & Species Conservation \u2013 both terrestrial and marine, Ecosystems Restoration, Environmental Education and Culture & Indigenous Communities.<ref>http://businessforpeace.no/meet-the-winners-merrill-joseph-fernando/</ref> In 2016, The Merrill J. Fernando Eco Innovation Awards was initiated calling for breakthrough, purposeful proposals of well-developed concepts and working prototypes that seek to solve current national and global environmental issues in the areas of [[Waste]], [[Water]], [[Energy]], Blue Economy and [[Biodiversity]].<ref>http://www.ft.lk/article/581614/Merrill-J.-Fernando-Eco-Innovation-Awards-rewards-creative-innovators#sthash.Xu5XcejI.dpuf</ref> \u201cI want to prevent the hardship of young entrepreneurs of today when I compare myself with the hardship that I went through in launching Dilmah Tea,\u201d Fernando said at the awards ceremony.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/161127/business-times/merrill-j-the-entrepreneur-who-beat-all-odds-to-succeed-in-his-venture-217954.html</ref>\n\n==Awards & achievements ==\nDilmah is the first producer owned tea brand in the world and is among the top ten tea brands. Merrill with over 70 years of expertise in tea has the distinction of being the most experienced teamaker in the world today. In 2005, Dilmah received an award from the Medinge Group for its work as a Brand with a Conscience and also received a Presidential Merit Award for contribution to the preservation of the environment in the same year. On the 6th of May 2015, Fernando received the Business for Peace Award in Oslo, Norway.<ref>http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150412/business-times/dilmahs-merril-j-selected-as-oslo-business-for-peace-2015-honouree-143728.html</ref>  The [[Business for Peace Foundation]] annually names honourees for the Oslo Business for Peace Award in recognition of business persons who, through their own actions and commitments truly are business worthy, promoting socially responsible and ethical business practice in an outstanding way, and standing out as examples to the world.<ref>http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Speeches/2015/Oslo-Business-for-Peace-Awards/</ref> In September 2016 Merrill was honoured with the Global Businessman Award at the [[Ada Derana]] Sri Lankan of the Year 2016. The award seeks to honour and celebrate the outstanding achievements of individuals/groups whose efforts have far-reaching influence on the country, positively impacting the local community and thereby help place Sri Lanka on the international limelight.<br>\n\nOn November 30, 2016 Fernando was honoured with the FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism and the award was presented by Philip Hammond MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, at the Royal Automobile Club, London. The Award recognises business ethics, emphasising his unique philosophy of making business a matter of human service. Fernando is the only Sri Lankan to have received this Award. The previous award winners include Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi the enormously respected CEO of PepsiCo, the Prince of Wales, and Prof. John Kay of the London School of Economics, to name a few.<ref>http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=37094</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSm7NIN5qRk</ref><ref>https://pressroom.dilmahtea.com/dilmah-in-news/celebrating-150-years-of-ceylon-tea-by-importing-tea--83.html</ref>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: mintcream; padding: 30px;margin: 20px 0\">\n* Honoured as a One of the Three Most Admired Leaders in Sri Lanka\u2019, he was chosen for his passionate commitment to \u201cQuality and Integrity\u201d, and for the philosophy he established at the heart of his Dilmah Tea business.

One who engages in sabotage is a ''saboteur''. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions.\n\nAny unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage. Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke, or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage.\n\n{{Anchor|ety}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nA [[Folk etymology|popular but false]] account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that poor workers in France, who wore wooden shoes called {{lang|fr|sabots}}, used to throw them into the machines to disrupt production.<ref name=\"etymonline\"/> This origin story is told in the 1991 movie [[Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country|Star Trek VI]]. This account is not supported by the etymology.<ref name=\"etymonline\"/> Rather, the French source word literally means to \"walk noisily\", as was done by sabot-wearing labourers, who interrupted production by means of labor disputes, not damage.<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sabotage |title=Sabotage  |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nOne of its first appearances in French literature is in the ''Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou mani\u00e8res de parler usit\u00e9es parmi le peuple'' of D'Hautel, edited in 1808.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=D'Hautel |first=Charles-Louis |date=1808 |title=Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou mani\u00e8res de parler usit\u00e9es parmi le peuple |trans-title=Dictionary of slang or ways to speak used by the people |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zT5p4cMNoWgC&pg=Pa325 |language=fr |page=325 |publisher=D'Hautel et Schoell |quote=Saboteur : Sobriquet injurieux qu'on donne \u00e0 un mauvais ouvrier, qui fait tout \u00e0 la h\u00e2te, et malproprement.}}</ref>\n\nThe verb \"saboter\" is also found in 1873\u20131874 in the ''Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise'' of [[\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite book |first=\u00c9mile |last=Littr\u00e9 |title=Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise |trans-title=Dictionary of the French language|publisher=Hachette |date=1873\u20131874 |page=1790 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54066991/f401}}</ref> But it is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of \"deliberately and maliciously destroying property\" or \"working slower\".

Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic \u2014 the French called it \"sabotage\" \u2014 won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 152.</ref><ref>Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|any withdrawal of efficiency]], including the [[slowdown]], the [[strike action|strike]], [[working to rule]], or creative bungling of job assignments.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages&nbsp;196\u2013197.</ref> [[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\" quoting W.D. Haywood.tif|thumb|[[Industrial Workers of the World]] \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\"]]\n\nOne of the most severe examples was at the construction site of the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station|Robert-Bourassa Generating Station]] in 1974, in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, when workers used bulldozers to topple electric generators, damaged fuel tanks, and set buildings on fire.  The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, [[Bechtel]] Corporation.<ref>Rinehart, J.W. ''The Tyranny of Work'', Canadian Social Problems Series. Academic Press Canada (1975), pp.&nbsp;78\u201379. {{ISBN|0-7747-3029-3}}.</ref>\n\n== As environmental action ==\n{{Main|Ecotage}}\nCertain groups turn to destruction of property to stop environmental destruction or to make visible arguments against forms of modern technology they consider detrimental to the environment. The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term [[eco-terrorist]] when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the [[monkey wrench]] thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by [[Edward Abbey]] in the novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.\n\nFrom 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or [[Earth Liberation Front]] engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.<ref>[[Earth Liberation Front]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}</ref>  ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front|work=targetofopportunity.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/Bari/TreeSpiking1|title=The Secret History of Tree Spiking \u2013 Part 1|work=iww.org}}</ref>\n\n== As war tactic ==\n[[File:\"WARNING FROM THE FBI\" - NARA - 516039.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] poster from the United States]]\n\nIn war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agent]] or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or [[logistics|logistic]] routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of [[Black Tom explosion|Black Tom]] and the [[Kingsland Explosion]].

For example, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) is alleged to have [[Siberian pipeline sabotage|sabotaged a Siberian pipeline]] during the [[Cold War]], using information from the [[Farewell Dossier]]. A more recent case may be the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment.

Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and [[reprisal]]. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \"human element\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \"human element\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=1\u20132|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\nThere are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \"General Interference with Organizations and Production\":\n\n* When possible, refer all matters to committees for \"further study and consideration\". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never fewer than five\n* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.\n* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\n* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.\n* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw.  Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.\n* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.  Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.\n* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.\n* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on.  See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.\n* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.\n\nFrom the section entitled, \"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \"Act stupid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=28\u201331|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===\nThe United States [[Office of Strategic Services]], later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \"...&nbsp;slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the [[United Nations]] War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|page=2|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== In World War I ===\nOn 30 July 1916, the [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in their fight.\n\nOn 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, [[Kingsland Explosion|set fire to his workbench]] at an ammunition assembly plant near [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages.

The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool.

The Home Army's sabotage operations [[Operation Wieniec|Operation Garland]] and [[Operation Belt|Operation Ribbon]] are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars \"wagony\", and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the rail roads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports.<ref>[[Home Army#Major operations]]</ref> As for Stalin's proxies, their actions lead to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The [[Gwardia Ludowa]] destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans.\n\nThe [[French Resistance]] ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the [[BBC radio]] or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943.

Though that control was to end according to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The [[Haganah]] focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The [[Stern Gang]] and the [[Irgun]] used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell-shocked Arab railway workers to strike.

Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic \u2014 the French called it \"sabotage\" \u2014 won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 152.</ref><ref>Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|any withdrawal of efficiency]], including the [[slowdown]], the [[strike action|strike]], [[working to rule]], or creative bungling of job assignments.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages&nbsp;196\u2013197.</ref> [[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\" quoting W.D.

The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD.

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term [[eco-terrorist]] when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the [[monkey wrench]] thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by [[Edward Abbey]] in the novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.\n\nFrom 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or [[Earth Liberation Front]] engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.<ref>[[Earth Liberation Front]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}</ref>  ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front|work=targetofopportunity.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/Bari/TreeSpiking1|title=The Secret History of Tree Spiking \u2013 Part 1|work=iww.org}}</ref>\n\n== As war tactic ==\n[[File:\"WARNING FROM THE FBI\" - NARA - 516039.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] poster from the United States]]\n\nIn war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agent]] or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or [[logistics|logistic]] routes.

For example, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) is alleged to have [[Siberian pipeline sabotage|sabotaged a Siberian pipeline]] during the [[Cold War]], using information from the [[Farewell Dossier]]. A more recent case may be the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]] by the [[United States]], [[Israel]] or, according to the latest news, even [[Russia]].<ref>Markoff, John, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/science/13stuxnet.html?scp=1&sq=Malware%20Aimed%20At%20Iran%20Hit%20Five%20Sites,%20Report%20Says&st=cse Malware Aimed at Iran Hit Five Sites, Report Says]\", ''[[New York Times]]'', 13 February 2011, p. 15.</ref>\n\nSabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin.

Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and [[reprisal]]. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \"human element\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \"human element\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=1\u20132|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\nThere are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \"General Interference with Organizations and Production\":\n\n* When possible, refer all matters to committees for \"further study and consideration\". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never fewer than five\n* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.\n* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\n* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.\n* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw.  Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.\n* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.  Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.\n* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.\n* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on.  See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.\n* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.\n\nFrom the section entitled, \"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \"Act stupid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=28\u201331|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===\nThe United States [[Office of Strategic Services]], later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \"...&nbsp;slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the [[United Nations]] War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|page=2|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== In World War I ===\nOn 30 July 1916, the [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in their fight.\n\nOn 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, [[Kingsland Explosion|set fire to his workbench]] at an ammunition assembly plant near [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages.

The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool.

Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the [[BBC radio]] or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943.

The German [[Abwehr]] entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company's main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber, but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission's completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Borrowed into Japanese ===\nIn Japanese, the verb [[Gairaigo#Grammatical function|saboru]] (\u30b5\u30dc\u308b) means to skip school or loaf on the job.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Birth control sabotage]]\n* [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]\n* [[Cichociemni]]\n* [[Colin Gubbins]]\n* [[Direct action]]\n* [[Espionage]]\n* [[Fifth column]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Guerrilla warfare]]\n* [[Industrial espionage]]\n* [[Kedyw]]\n* [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]\n* [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]]\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Setting up to fail]]\n* [[Social undermining]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]]\n* [[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]]\n* [[Terrorism]]\n* ''[[The Mole (TV series)|The Mole]]'', TV series\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[\u00c9mile Pouget]], ''Le sabotage; notes et postface de Gr\u00e9goire Chamayou et Mathieu Triclot'', 1913; Mille et une nuit, 2004; English translation, ''Sabotage'', paperback, 112 pp., University Press of the Pacific, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89875-459-3}}.\n* Pasquinelli, Matteo.
