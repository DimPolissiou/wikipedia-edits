I'd say it's about 75% true to life, and the rest is just creative writing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/mario-interview-053007/|title=Mario Interview|access-date=2009-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606233929/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/mario-interview-053007/|archive-date=2007-06-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nMark Edward Nero of [[About.com]] says \"The track isn't particularly groundbreaking, but it has a simple charm, in a sort of [[Ne-Yo]] meets [[Toni Braxton]] kind of way\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://randb.about.com/b/2007/10/30/new-music-mario-how-do-i-breathe.htm|title=New Music: Mario - \"How Do I Breathe\"}}</ref>\n\nAaron Fields of [[KSTW|KSTW.com]] stated: \"First single off the album, yet didn't have the success like \"Let me love you\" did.

It consists of a {{Convert|13.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} refractor and a {{Convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} reflector in separate domes.<ref name=VYSOS />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mauna Kea Observatories]]\n* [[List of solar telescopes]]\n* [[List of astronomical observatories]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=SLIDES>{{Cite web |title=Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (HAO/NCAR): slideshow |url=http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu/mlso_slideshow.php?image=06 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130725194811/http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu/mlso_slideshow.php?image=06 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-25 |publisher=Mauna Loa Solar Observatory |access-date=2012-01-15 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ABOUT>{{Cite web |title=Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (HAO/NCAR): About MLSO and Its Instrumentation |url=http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu/mlso_about.html |publisher=Mauna Loa Solar Observatory |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214050/http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu/mlso_about.html |archive-date=2011-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=COMP>{{Cite web |title=COSMO Site - The Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter |url=http://www.cosmo.ucar.edu/COMP.html |publisher=High Altitude Observatory |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=AMIBA>{{Cite web |title=AMIBA - Introduction |url=http://amiba.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/introduct.html |publisher=Academica Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=GONG>{{Cite web |title=NSO/GONG: Site - Mauna Loa |url=http://gong.nso.edu/sites/maunaloa.shtml |publisher=National Solar Observatory |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=VYSOS>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~reipurth/VYSOS/Home.html |title=VYSOS Variable Young Stellar Object Survey |publisher=University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hao.ucar.edu/ High Altitude Observatory]\n* [http://ncar.ucar.edu/ National Center for Atmospheric Research]\n\n[[Category:Mauna Loa]]\n[[Category:Astronomical observatories in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hawaii County, Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Solar observatories]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa_Solar_Observatory"}
