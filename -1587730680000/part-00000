The team was officially formed in 1987 and is nicknamed the Eagles. \n\nAn international powerhouse during the 1990s\u2014 the Eagles won the inaugural [[1991 Women's Rugby World Cup|1991 Women's World Cup]] and finished second in the two following World Cups in [[1994 Women's Rugby World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 Women's Rugby World Cup|1998]]. The team finished fourth in the most recent Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland. \n\nIn May 2018, the Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with [[Saracens Women]].\n\n==History==\n''(Source: [http://www.uswrf.org/History.aspx US Women's Rugby Foundation])''\n\nThe history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 \u2013 the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine.{{citation needed|this could all be true, but we need sources for it to stay in Wikipedia|date=March 2019}}\n\n===1980s\u20131991===\nIn 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An \u2018invitation-only\u2019 team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. [http://womensrugbyhistory.blogspot.com/1985/11/times-nov-23-1985-pg.html The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France]. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team.\n\nIn 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name \u2018USA Presidents 15\u2019, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3\u20131 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O\u2019Brien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. \nAlso in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Present===\nThe USA Women's National Team XVs most recently finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction. \n\nThe Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects. All age-grade and development programs are umbrellaed under the national team program and serve as a feeder to the senior Women's Eagles.\n\n==2019 Performance Squad==\nThe 2019 Performance Squad serves as the top tier of the USA Women's National Team XVs depth chart. Other tiers include the extended squad and the watchlist.

Known as the USA Women's Sevens or Eagles Sevens, the program had its most successful season of all-time in 2019, claiming five medals in six tournaments during the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series where they finished with a World No. 2 ranking, won their first-ever gold medal and qualified for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\nIn 1996 the first assembly of a National Women's 7s team was formed. Emil Signes held tryouts to pick a team to compete in the first Women's International 7s tournament to be held during the Hong Kong 7s event. The team competed under the name \u2018Atlantis\u2019, the National 7s program created by Emil, and finished their tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to compete for the USA Women's 7s Team in the Hong Kong 7s Women's Division.\n\nIn 1997 The U23 women's national team was formed. USA Women's National Team Head Coach Franck Boivert appointed Penn State Coach Peter Steinberg to be Head Coach for the U23 Women's National Team program. At an event in the CanAm Series the US Women's National Team celebrated their 10-year anniversary by cheering on the Women's U23 National Team in their first test against Canada.\n\n== Match List -

The team was officially formed in 1987 and is nicknamed the Eagles. \n\nAn international powerhouse during the 1990s\u2014 the Eagles won the inaugural [[1991 Women's Rugby World Cup|1991 Women's World Cup]] and finished second in the two following World Cups in [[1994 Women's Rugby World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 Women's Rugby World Cup|1998]]. The team finished fourth in the most recent Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland. \n\nIn May 2018, the Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with [[Saracens Women]].\n\n==History==\n''(Source: [http://www.uswrf.org/History.aspx US Women's Rugby Foundation])''\n\nThe history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 \u2013 the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine.{{citation needed|this could all be true, but we need sources for it to stay in Wikipedia|date=March 2019}}\n\n===1980s\u20131991===\nIn 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An \u2018invitation-only\u2019 team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. [http://womensrugbyhistory.blogspot.com/1985/11/times-nov-23-1985-pg.html The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France]. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team.\n\nIn 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name \u2018USA Presidents 15\u2019, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3\u20131 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O\u2019Brien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. \nAlso in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Present===\nThe USA Women's National Team XVs most recently finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction. \n\nThe Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects. All age-grade and development programs are umbrellaed under the national team program and serve as a feeder to the senior Women's Eagles.\n\n==2019 Performance Squad==\nThe 2019 Performance Squad serves as the top tier of the USA Women's National Team XVs depth chart.

Known as the USA Women's Sevens or Eagles Sevens, the program had its most successful season of all-time in 2019, claiming five medals in six tournaments during the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series where they finished with a World No. 2 ranking, won their first-ever gold medal and qualified for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\nIn 1996 the first assembly of a National Women's 7s team was formed. Emil Signes held tryouts to pick a team to compete in the first Women's International 7s tournament to be held during the Hong Kong 7s event. The team competed under the name \u2018Atlantis\u2019, the National 7s program created by Emil, and finished their tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to compete for the USA Women's 7s Team in the Hong Kong 7s Women's Division.\n\nIn 1997 The U23 women's national team was formed. USA Women's National Team Head Coach Franck Boivert appointed Penn State Coach Peter Steinberg to be Head Coach for the U23 Women's National Team program. At an event in the CanAm Series the US Women's National Team celebrated their 10-year anniversary by cheering on the Women's U23 National Team in their first test against Canada.\n\n== Match List -

Their organization was established by General [[Soedirman]], following the model of the [[Military district (Germany)|German Wehrkreise system]]. The system was later codified in ''Surat Perintah Siasat No.1'', signed by General Soedirman in November 1948.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Army's structure underwent various reorganisations throughout its early years. From 1946 to 1952, the Army was organized into combined arms [[division (military)|division]]s. These were consolidated in 1951, and then dispersed in 1952.  From 1952 to 1958-59, the Army was organised into seven Territorial Armies (''Tentara & Teritoriums'')  composed of regiments and independent formations at battalion level and below. In August 1958, the Indonesian Army reconsolidated its territorial organization. This created sixteen regional commands, which retained earlier divisional titles; the [[Siliwangi Division]], for example, became ''Kodam VI/Siliwangi''.<ref>Ken Conboy, Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces, Equinox Publishing, Jakarta/Singapore, 2003, p.79</ref> The RCs were subdivided administratively into Areas (the former territorial regiments), Districts (the former regimental battalions) and District Sectors, and operationally composed of a number of speciality battalions and in some regional commands, an infantry brigade.\n\nA reorganisation in 1985 made significant changes in the army chain of command. The four multiservice Regional Defence Commands (''Kowilhan''s) and the National Strategic Forces Command (''Kostranas'') were eliminated from the defence structure, re-establishing the Regional Military Commands (''Kodam'') as the key organisation for strategic, tactical, and territorial operations for all services. By then, the 16 regions were reduced to just 9.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Study]], Indonesia, November 1992, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0177) Organization of the Armed Forces]</ref> The chain of command flowed directly from the ABRI commander in chief via the Chief of Staff of the Army to the ten territorial commanders, and then to subordinate army territorial commands. In 1999, the number of regions grew to 10, and today, there are around 15 in active operation.\n\nThe territorial commands incorporate [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] and district commands each with [[List of Indonesian infantry battalions|infantry battalions]], sometimes a [[cavalry]] battalion, [[artillery]], or [[engineer]]s. The number of activated infantry brigades is increasing.<ref>[[The Military Balance 2006]], ''[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]''</ref> Some have Raider battalions attached.\n\n== Organization of Regional Commands==\nEach Regional Command is led by a general officer of Major General rank, assisted by a Chief of Staff, a billet of a Brigadier General.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

Once the technique is mastered, a high wheeler can be mounted and dismounted easily on flat ground and some hills.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nAn attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits high and nearly over the front axle. When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard. Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546\n| url-access = registration\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n|author2=Jim Papadopoulos\n| year = 2004\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/22 22]\n| quote = Whatton bars were handlebars that came under the legs from behind, so that in the event of a pitch forward the rider could land feet first.\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1}}</ref>\n\nPenny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes: cast iron frames, solid rubber tires, and [[plain bearing]]s for pedals, steering, and wheels. They were often quite durable and required little service. For example, when cyclist [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]] rode around the world in the 1880s, he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over {{convert|20000|km|mile}}, caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel.\n\n=== End of an era ===\n\nThe well-known dangers of the penny-farthing<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Herlihy\n | first = David V.\n | authorlink = \n | title = Bicycle: the History\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n | year = 2004\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226 226]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226\n | isbn = 0-300-10418-9\n}}</ref> were, for the time of its prominence, outweighed by its strengths. While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a [[gear ratio]] to be chosen independent of the wheel size. The second was the pneumatic [[bicycle tire]], allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.\n[[File:L-Hochrad.png|thumb|An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and the first modern bicycle, [[John Kemp Starley|J.

Instead of using [[Bicycle gearing|gears]] to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged to be close to the rider's [[inseam]], to increase the maximum speed.

A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|trail]]. A [[Bicycle brake systems#Spoon brakes|spoon brake]] is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever from one of the [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]]. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]]. The [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]] mounts on the frame less than {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the headset.\n\nOne particular model, made by [[Pope Manufacturing Company]] in 1886, weighs {{convert|36|lb|kg}}, has a 60-spoke {{convert|53|inch|cm|adj=on}} front wheel and a 20-spoke {{convert|18|inch|cm|adj=on}} rear wheel.

Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546\n| url-access = registration\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n|author2=Jim Papadopoulos\n| year = 2004\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/22 22]\n| quote = Whatton bars were handlebars that came under the legs from behind, so that in the event of a pitch forward the rider could land feet first.\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1}}</ref>\n\nPenny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes: cast iron frames, solid rubber tires, and [[plain bearing]]s for pedals, steering, and wheels. They were often quite durable and required little service. For example, when cyclist [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]] rode around the world in the 1880s, he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over {{convert|20000|km|mile}}, caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel.\n\n=== End of an era ===\n\nThe well-known dangers of the penny-farthing<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Herlihy\n | first = David V.\n | authorlink = \n | title = Bicycle: the History\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n | year = 2004\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226 226]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226\n | isbn = 0-300-10418-9\n}}</ref> were, for the time of its prominence, outweighed by its strengths. While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a [[gear ratio]] to be chosen independent of the wheel size. The second was the pneumatic [[bicycle tire]], allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.\n[[File:L-Hochrad.png|thumb|An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and the first modern bicycle, [[John Kemp Starley|J.

In 1885, Starley's nephew [[John Kemp Starley]] took these new developments to launch the modern bicycle, the [[Rover_Company#Before_cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]], so-called because the rider, seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.<ref name=Herlihy/><ref>{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, when [[John Boyd Dunlop|John Dunlop]] re-invented the pneumatic tire for his son's tricycle, the high wheel was made obsolete.

Instead of using [[Bicycle gearing|gears]] to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged to be close to the rider's [[inseam]], to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat.<ref name=Herlihy/>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe frame is a single tube following the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|trail]]. A [[Bicycle brake systems#Spoon brakes|spoon brake]] is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever from one of the [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]]. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]]. The [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]] mounts on the frame less than {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the headset.\n\nOne particular model, made by [[Pope Manufacturing Company]] in 1886, weighs {{convert|36|lb|kg}}, has a 60-spoke {{convert|53|inch|cm|adj=on}} front wheel and a 20-spoke {{convert|18|inch|cm|adj=on}} rear wheel. It is fitted with solid rubber tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars are made from hollow, [[steel]] tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable [[ball bearing]]s. The leather saddle is suspended by springs.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_285.html\n| title = National Museum of American History, America on the Move Collection: Columbia Light Roadster ordinary bicycle\n| accessdate = 2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\nAnother model, made by [[Humber Cycles|Humber and Co., Ltd.]], of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston, Nottingham]], England, weighs only {{convert|24|lb|kg}}, and has {{convert|52|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} wheels.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show'').
