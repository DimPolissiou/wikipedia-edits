The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company [[Softdisk]], [[game programmer|programmers]] [[John Carmack]] and [[John Romero]], [[game designer]] [[Tom Hall]], and artist [[Adrian Carmack]] (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved. id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] (running [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), including work done for the ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'' franchises. id's work was particularly important in [[3D computer graphics]] technology and in [[game engine]]s that are used throughout the [[video game industry]]. The company was involved in the creation of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre. ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' is often considered to be the first true FPS, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was id's first true 3D FPS.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318001938/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |archive-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of id Software met in the offices of [[Softdisk]] developing multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing, including ''[[Dangerous Dave]]''. In September 1990, [[John Carmack]] developed [[adaptive tile refresh|an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics]] on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and [[Tom Hall]] stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', inserting stock graphics of [[John Romero]]'s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the [[game demo|demo]], entitled \"Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement\", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to \"borrow\" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n\nDespite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]] of [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, ''Dangerous Dave'', and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with John Romero |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |date=May 15, 2006 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121949/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |archive-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years of Evolution: Scott Miller and 3D Realms |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808123226/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |archive-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller, including ''[[Commander Keen]]'' in December 1990, which became a very successful [[shareware]] game.

One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as \"Wac-Man\" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the ''Keen'' engine, but also how it worked internally.\n\nid Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[ShadowCaster]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=David |authorlink=David Kushner |title=[[Masters of Doom]] |edition=paperback |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=119\u2013122 |isbn=0-8129-7215-5}}</ref> ''Doom'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', and ''Quake III'', as well as the technology used in making ''Doom 3''. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to ''Eurogamer.net'', \"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized\". During the mid to late 1990s, \"the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position\", with the ''Quake III'' engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However [[id Tech 4]] had far fewer licensees than the [[Unreal Engine]] from [[Epic Games]], due to the long development time that went into ''Doom 3'' which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with Wolfenstein 3D, he felt bothered when third-party companies started \"pestering\" him to licence the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be \"holding the hands\" of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamespot |title=id Software 20th Anniversary Feature |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoLaA-CVmTE |website=YouTube |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing [[source code]], John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Historically, the [[source code]] for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'' engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original ''Quake'' engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Another such project is [[ioquake3]], which maintains a goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'', was released in June 2014 by [[Flat Rock Software]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |title=id Software's Softdisk Open-Sources Some Really Old Games |first=Michael |last=Larabel |date=June 6, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2014 |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609231037/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |archive-date=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe GPL release of the ''Quake III'' engine's source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, [[John Carmack]] revealed during his [[QuakeCon]] 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine ([[id Tech 4]]) during the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doom 3 Source-Code To Be Released This Year |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045711/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |archive-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nid Software publicly stated they would not support the [[Wii]] console (possibly due to technical limitations),<ref>{{cite web |title=id Software boss unconvinced by Wii |url=http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413101828/http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |archive-date=April 13, 2009}}</ref> although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001953/http://www.cubed3.com/news/6961/1/id_Properties_Coming_to_Wii \"id Properties Coming to Wii\"] from Cubed3</ref> They did the same thing with the [[Wii U]] but for [[Nintendo Switch]], they collaborated with [[Panic Button (company)|Panic Button]] to release 2016's [[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]] and [[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]].\n\nSince id Software revealed their engine [[id Tech 5]], they call their engines \"[[id Tech]]\", followed by a version number.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215034944/http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=id Software: Technology licensing |publisher=idsoftware.com |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] as id Tech 1.\n\n=== Linux gaming ===\n[[File:Timothee-Besset.jpg|thumb|right|Timothee Besset has been responsible for many Linux ports of id Software's games]]\nid Software was an early pioneer in the [[Linux gaming]] market,<ref>[http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 HEXUS.gaming \u2013 Feature \u2013 Linux Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184812/http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 |date=July 19, 2011 }} Jo Shields, March 25, 2005</ref> and id Software's [[Linux]] games have been some of the most popular of the platform.

After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and ''[[Doom 3]]''. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', and the second, ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', using the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine|engine]]. A third ''Wolfenstein'' sequel, simply titled ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', was released by [[Raven Software]], using the [[id Tech 4]] [[game engine|engine]]. Another sequel, named ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''; was developed by [[MachineGames]] using the [[id Tech 5]] engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n{{Main|Doom (franchise)}}\nEighteen months after their release of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', on December 10, 1993, id Software released ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. ''Doom'' featured a [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even [[video game console]]s. ''Doom'' became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of [[Video game controversy|criticism]] decrying the dangers of violence in video games. ''Doom'' was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. id Software made its mark in video game history with the [[shareware]] release of ''Doom'', and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of ''[[Doom 3]]''. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there would be a ''[[Doom 4]]''.

''Quake'' combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band's logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of [[Michael Abrash]]. Furthermore, ''Quake'''s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on ''[[QuakeWorld]]''), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.\n\nIn 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for the pioneering work ''Quake'' represented in user modifiable games.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners 2008 Tech Emmy Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094303/http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners |date=September 29, 2012 }} from Kotaku.com</ref> id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern [[Shooter game|shooter]] video games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x \"John Carmack and id Software's pioneering development work in 3d games recognized with two Technology Emmy Awards\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705061409/http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x |date=July 5, 2008 }} from [[Shacknews]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] continued with ''[[Quake II]]'' in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for [[Strogg]] attacks on [[Earth]]. Most of the subsequent entries in the ''Quake'' franchise follow this storyline. ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the \"Arena Eternal\", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in ''Doom'' (\"[[Doomguy]]\"), ''Quake'' (Ranger, Wrack), and ''Quake II'' (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). ''[[Quake IV]]'' (2005) picks up where ''Quake II'' left off \u2013 finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' acts as a prequel to ''Quake II'', when the Strogg first invade Earth. ''Quake IV'' and ''Enemy Territory: Quake Wars'' were made by outside developers and not id.\n\nThere have also been other spin-offs such as [[Quake (video game)#Quake Mobile|Quake Mobile]] in 2005 and ''[[Quake Live]]'', an internet browser based modification of ''Quake III''. A game called ''Quake Arena DS'' was planned and canceled for the [[Nintendo DS]].

''In the Haunted Mansion'' was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game ''[[Shadow Knights]]'', which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for [[Softdisk]], where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as ''[[ShadowCaster]]'', (early-[[Doom engine|id Tech 1]]), ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' (id Tech 1), ''[[Hexen II]]'' ([[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]]), and ''[[Orcs and Elves]]'' (''[[Doom RPG]]'' engine).\n\n== Other media ==\nid Software has also published novels based on the Doom series [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]]. After a brief hiatus from publishing, id resumed and re-launched the novel series in 2008 with [[Matthew J. Costello]]'s (a story consultant for ''[[Doom 3]]'' and now ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'') new ''Doom 3'' novels: ''[[Doom 3: Worlds on Fire|Worlds on Fire]]'' and ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]''.\n\nid Software became involved in film development when they oversaw the film adaption of their ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' franchise in 2005. In August 2007, [[Todd Hollenshead]] stated at QuakeCon 2007 that a ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein (film)|Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' movie is in development which re-teams the ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' writer/producer team, [[Roger Avary]] as writer and director and [[Samuel Hadida]] as producer. A new ''Doom'' film, titled ''[[Doom: Annihilation]]'', was released in 2019, although id itself stressed its lack of involvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/12/doom-studio-makes-very-clear-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-doom-movie|title=Doom Studio Makes Very Clear It Has Nothing to Do With New Doom Movie|first=Adam|last=Bankhurst|work=IGN|date=March 12, 2019|accessdate=March 12, 2019|archivedate=March 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190313010232/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/12/doom-studio-makes-very-clear-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-doom-movie|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nid Software was the target of controversy over two of their most popular games, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)#Controversies|Doom]]'' and the earlier ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'':\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[Graphic violence#Internet|gore]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Entertainment Software Rating Board |title=Game ratings |url=http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |access-date=December 4, 2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216031317/http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |archive-date=February 16, 2006}}</ref> and [[occultism]] along with [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups.

[[Harvard Medical School]] researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The [[United States Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Education]] analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers\u2014like the vast majority of young teenage boys\u2014did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between gameplay and school shootings. In fact, only one-eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |format=PDF |date= |access-date=November 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804232200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archive-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein 3D'' ===\nAs for ''Wolfenstein 3D'', due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the [[swastika]] and the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht M\u00fcnchen on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in ''Wolfenstein'', the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the [[Atari Jaguar]] version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.\n\nDue to concerns from Nintendo of America, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in ''The Official DOOM Player Guide'' about the reaction to ''Wolfenstein'', claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== People ==\nIn 2003, the book ''[[Masters of Doom]]'' chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id's success.\n\n=== John Carmack ===\n{{Main|John Carmack}}\nCarmack's skill at [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer programming|programming]] is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id's [[lead programmer]]. On August 7, 2013, he joined [[Oculus VR]], a company developing [[virtual reality headset]]s, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.<ref name=carmack-leaves-id />\n\n=== John Romero ===\n{{Main|John Romero}}\nJohn Romero, who was forced to resign in 1996 after the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', later formed the ill-fated company [[Ion Storm]]. There, he became infamous through the development of ''[[Daikatana]]'', which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release.\n\nBoth Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.\n\n=== Tom Hall ===\n{{Main|Tom Hall}}\nTom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of ''Doom'' development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of ''Doom'' and then went to work for Apogee, developing ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' with the \"Developers of Incredible Power\". When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at [[Ion Storm]]. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to ''[[Commander Keen]]'', he would immediately develop another Keen title.\n\n=== Sandy Petersen ===\n{{Main|Sandy Petersen}}\nSandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original ''Doom'' title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of ''Doom II''. As a fan of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for ''Quake'', and he created ''Inferno'', the third \"episode\" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of ''Quake II'' and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.\n\n=== American McGee ===\n{{Main|American McGee}}\nAmerican McGee was a [[level designer]] for ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Quake'', and ''Quake II''. He was asked to resign after the release of ''Quake II'', then moved to [[Electronic Arts]] where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads [[independent game development]] house [[Spicy Horse]] in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Kushner, David (2003).

The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company [[Softdisk]], [[game programmer|programmers]] [[John Carmack]] and [[John Romero]], [[game designer]] [[Tom Hall]], and artist [[Adrian Carmack]] (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved. id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] (running [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), including work done for the ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'' franchises. id's work was particularly important in [[3D computer graphics]] technology and in [[game engine]]s that are used throughout the [[video game industry]]. The company was involved in the creation of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre. ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' is often considered to be the first true FPS, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was id's first true 3D FPS.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318001938/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |archive-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of id Software met in the offices of [[Softdisk]] developing multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing, including ''[[Dangerous Dave]]''. In September 1990, [[John Carmack]] developed [[adaptive tile refresh|an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics]] on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and [[Tom Hall]] stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', inserting stock graphics of [[John Romero]]'s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the [[game demo|demo]], entitled \"Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement\", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to \"borrow\" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n\nDespite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]] of [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, ''Dangerous Dave'', and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with John Romero |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |date=May 15, 2006 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121949/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |archive-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years of Evolution: Scott Miller and 3D Realms |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808123226/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |archive-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller, including ''[[Commander Keen]]'' in December 1990, which became a very successful [[shareware]] game.

Brainstormed by [[John Romero]], id Software held a weekend session titled \"The id Summer Seminar\" in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]], [[George Broussard]], Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and [[Todd Replogle]]. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as \"Wac-Man\" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the ''Keen'' engine, but also how it worked internally.\n\nid Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[ShadowCaster]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=David |authorlink=David Kushner |title=[[Masters of Doom]] |edition=paperback |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=119\u2013122 |isbn=0-8129-7215-5}}</ref> ''Doom'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', and ''Quake III'', as well as the technology used in making ''Doom 3''. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to ''Eurogamer.net'', \"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized\". During the mid to late 1990s, \"the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position\", with the ''Quake III'' engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However [[id Tech 4]] had far fewer licensees than the [[Unreal Engine]] from [[Epic Games]], due to the long development time that went into ''Doom 3'' which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with Wolfenstein 3D, he felt bothered when third-party companies started \"pestering\" him to licence the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be \"holding the hands\" of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamespot |title=id Software 20th Anniversary Feature |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoLaA-CVmTE |website=YouTube |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing [[source code]], John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Historically, the [[source code]] for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'' engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original ''Quake'' engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Another such project is [[ioquake3]], which maintains a goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'', was released in June 2014 by [[Flat Rock Software]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |title=id Software's Softdisk Open-Sources Some Really Old Games |first=Michael |last=Larabel |date=June 6, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2014 |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609231037/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |archive-date=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe GPL release of the ''Quake III'' engine's source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, [[John Carmack]] revealed during his [[QuakeCon]] 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine ([[id Tech 4]]) during the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doom 3 Source-Code To Be Released This Year |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045711/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |archive-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nid Software publicly stated they would not support the [[Wii]] console (possibly due to technical limitations),<ref>{{cite web |title=id Software boss unconvinced by Wii |url=http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413101828/http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |archive-date=April 13, 2009}}</ref> although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001953/http://www.cubed3.com/news/6961/1/id_Properties_Coming_to_Wii \"id Properties Coming to Wii\"] from Cubed3</ref> They did the same thing with the [[Wii U]] but for [[Nintendo Switch]], they collaborated with [[Panic Button (company)|Panic Button]] to release 2016's [[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]] and [[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]].\n\nSince id Software revealed their engine [[id Tech 5]], they call their engines \"[[id Tech]]\", followed by a version number.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215034944/http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=id Software: Technology licensing |publisher=idsoftware.com |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] as id Tech 1.\n\n=== Linux gaming ===\n[[File:Timothee-Besset.jpg|thumb|right|Timothee Besset has been responsible for many Linux ports of id Software's games]]\nid Software was an early pioneer in the [[Linux gaming]] market,<ref>[http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 HEXUS.gaming \u2013 Feature \u2013 Linux Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184812/http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 |date=July 19, 2011 }} Jo Shields, March 25, 2005</ref> and id Software's [[Linux]] games have been some of the most popular of the platform.

Published by Apogee Software, the title and follow-ups brought id Software success as a shareware developer. It is the series of id Software that designer [[Tom Hall]] is most affiliated with.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The first ''Commander Keen'' trilogy was released on December 14, 1990.\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein'' ===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein (series)}}\nThe company's breakout product was released on May 5, 1992: ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) with smooth 3D graphics that were unprecedented in computer games, and with violent gameplay that many gamers found engaging. After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and ''[[Doom 3]]''. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', and the second, ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', using the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine|engine]]. A third ''Wolfenstein'' sequel, simply titled ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', was released by [[Raven Software]], using the [[id Tech 4]] [[game engine|engine]]. Another sequel, named ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''; was developed by [[MachineGames]] using the [[id Tech 5]] engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n{{Main|Doom (franchise)}}\nEighteen months after their release of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', on December 10, 1993, id Software released ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. ''Doom'' featured a [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even [[video game console]]s. ''Doom'' became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of [[Video game controversy|criticism]] decrying the dangers of violence in video games. ''Doom'' was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. id Software made its mark in video game history with the [[shareware]] release of ''Doom'', and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of ''[[Doom 3]]''. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there would be a ''[[Doom 4]]''. It began development on May 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks Rage, id Tech 5 And More |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', the fourth installation and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Doom series, was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on November 10, 2017. In June 2018, the sequel to the 2016 reboot, ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018|E3 2018]] with a teaser trailer, followed by a gameplay reveal at [[QuakeCon]] in August 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official Gameplay Reveal |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGq8Ee2gOe4 |website=YouTube |publisher=Bethesda Softworks |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official E3 Teaser |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVwrpfo_QA |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Quake'' ===\n{{Main|Quake (series)}}\nOn June 22, 1996, the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' marked the third milestone in id Software history. ''Quake'' combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band's logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of [[Michael Abrash]]. Furthermore, ''Quake'''s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on ''[[QuakeWorld]]''), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.\n\nIn 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for the pioneering work ''Quake'' represented in user modifiable games.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners 2008 Tech Emmy Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094303/http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners |date=September 29, 2012 }} from Kotaku.com</ref> id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern [[Shooter game|shooter]] video games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x \"John Carmack and id Software's pioneering development work in 3d games recognized with two Technology Emmy Awards\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705061409/http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x |date=July 5, 2008 }} from [[Shacknews]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] continued with ''[[Quake II]]'' in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for [[Strogg]] attacks on [[Earth]]. Most of the subsequent entries in the ''Quake'' franchise follow this storyline. ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the \"Arena Eternal\", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in ''Doom'' (\"[[Doomguy]]\"), ''Quake'' (Ranger, Wrack), and ''Quake II'' (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). ''[[Quake IV]]'' (2005) picks up where ''Quake II'' left off \u2013 finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' acts as a prequel to ''Quake II'', when the Strogg first invade Earth. ''Quake IV'' and ''Enemy Territory: Quake Wars'' were made by outside developers and not id.\n\nThere have also been other spin-offs such as [[Quake (video game)#Quake Mobile|Quake Mobile]] in 2005 and ''[[Quake Live]]'', an internet browser based modification of ''Quake III''. A game called ''Quake Arena DS'' was planned and canceled for the [[Nintendo DS]]. John Carmack stated, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, that the ''[[id Tech 5]]'' engine would be used for a new ''Quake'' game.\n\n=== ''Rage'' ===\n{{Main|Rage (video game)}}\nTodd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine. Hollenshead also mentioned that the title would be completely developed in-house, marking the first game since 2004's ''[[Doom 3]]'' to be done so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025815/http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=New IP Coming From id Software |publisher=Totalgaming.net |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref> At 2007's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]], John Carmack showed the new engine called [[id Tech 5]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |title=WWDC: Game On |publisher=MacRumors |date=June 11, 2007 |access-date=June 11, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170810/http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Later that year, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, the title of the new game was revealed as ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |title=id Reveals Rage, Implies PS3, 360 and PC Versions |publisher=shacknews |date=August 3, 2007 |access-date=August 3, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235543/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |archive-date=September 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 2008, id Software announced at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] event that they would be publishing ''Rage'' through [[Electronic Arts]], and not id's longtime publisher [[Activision]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |title=id Software, EA Partner For RAGE Publishing Deal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730003532/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |archive-date=July 30, 2008}}</ref> However, since then ZeniMax has also announced that they are publishing ''Rage'' through [[Bethesda Softworks]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bethblog.com/index.php/2009/12/15/bethesda-softworks-to-publish-rage/ |title=ZeniMax/Bethesda to publish RAGE}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2010, during Quakecon 2010, id Software announced ''Rage'' US ship date of September 13, 2011, and a European ship date of September 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |title=id shows more Rage and announces release date |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819145447/http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |archive-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> During the keynote, id Software also demonstrated a ''Rage'' spin-off title running on the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |title=QuakeCon: Rage coming to iPhone, running at 60fps |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218110711/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |archive-date=December 18, 2010}} from Joystiq.com</ref> This technology demo later became ''Rage HD''.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Bethesda Softworks announced ''[[Rage 2]]'', a co-development between id Software and [[Avalanche Studios]].\n\n=== Other games ===\n[[File:Keen3Gameplay.png|thumb|right|180px|Screenshot of a ''Commander Keen'' game, ''Keen Must Die!'']]\n[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|180px|A screenshot from the first episode of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'']]\nDuring its early days, id Software produced much more varied games; these include the early 3D first-person shooter experiments that led to ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' \u2013 ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]''. There was also the ''[[Rescue Rover]]'' series, which had two games \u2013 ''Rescue Rover'' and ''Rescue Rover 2''. Also there was [[John Romero]]'s ''[[Dangerous Dave]]'' series, which included such notables as the tech demo (''In Copyright Infringement'') which led to the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' engine, and the decently popular ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]''. ''In the Haunted Mansion'' was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game ''[[Shadow Knights]]'', which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for [[Softdisk]], where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as ''[[ShadowCaster]]'', (early-[[Doom engine|id Tech 1]]), ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' (id Tech 1), ''[[Hexen II]]'' ([[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]]), and ''[[Orcs and Elves]]'' (''[[Doom RPG]]'' engine).\n\n== Other media ==\nid Software has also published novels based on the Doom series [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]].

[[Harvard Medical School]] researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The [[United States Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Education]] analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers\u2014like the vast majority of young teenage boys\u2014did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between gameplay and school shootings. In fact, only one-eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |format=PDF |date= |access-date=November 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804232200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archive-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein 3D'' ===\nAs for ''Wolfenstein 3D'', due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the [[swastika]] and the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht M\u00fcnchen on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in ''Wolfenstein'', the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the [[Atari Jaguar]] version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.\n\nDue to concerns from Nintendo of America, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in ''The Official DOOM Player Guide'' about the reaction to ''Wolfenstein'', claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well.

When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at [[Ion Storm]]. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to ''[[Commander Keen]]'', he would immediately develop another Keen title.\n\n=== Sandy Petersen ===\n{{Main|Sandy Petersen}}\nSandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original ''Doom'' title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of ''Doom II''. As a fan of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for ''Quake'', and he created ''Inferno'', the third \"episode\" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of ''Quake II'' and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.\n\n=== American McGee ===\n{{Main|American McGee}}\nAmerican McGee was a [[level designer]] for ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Quake'', and ''Quake II''. He was asked to resign after the release of ''Quake II'', then moved to [[Electronic Arts]] where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads [[independent game development]] house [[Spicy Horse]] in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Kushner, David (2003).

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\"&nbsp;''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is not known in which jaw the tooth was positioned or which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible, although poorly defined, serrations. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, because the rear of the tooth is obscured by a rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}&nbsp;-long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]]&nbsp;V&nbsp;4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues most likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|alt=A tooth of the related genus ''Spinosaurus'' | Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth. Though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods. By feeding on different prey items, and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|alt=Restoration of Siamosaurus hunting fish | Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\"&nbsp;''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is not known in which jaw the tooth was positioned or which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible, although poorly defined, serrations. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, because the rear of the tooth is obscured by a rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}&nbsp;-long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]]&nbsp;V&nbsp;4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues most likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|alt=A tooth of the related genus ''Spinosaurus'' | Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''.

Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics, and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel.

He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods.

Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary  was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The show follows the life of Josep Lopes and David G\u00fcell. The show was co-produced by [[Kr\u00e0mpack]], [[El Terrat]] and [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]] and directed by Oriol Grau, Llu\u00eds Manyoses and Joel Joan. The series, which ran for 73 episodes of between 25 and 30 minutes over six seasons, was broadcast between April 19, 1999 and April 15, 2002.\n\nPlats Bruts enjoyed very good ratings from the beginning, reaching up to a million viewers in the second episode broadcast, and achieved an average of over 35% share and 900,000 viewers in Catalonia. Afterwards the series was broadcast on [[Canal 300]] and [[3XL]] and dubbed into Spanish so it could be aired on ''V\u00eda Digital'', a digital platform which a predecessor of [[Movistar Plus]] and [[ETB 2]], a channel broadcasting in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. \n\nThe series generally contained self-contained stories, with no  continuous plot.

The show regularly makes fun of Catalan society, especially in its references to [[Catalanism]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nL\u00f3pes and David are two men who share a flat in the [[Eixample]] district of [[Barcelona]]. The relationship between the two exists because Lopes was David's Boy Scout leader when he was young but, in terms of their personality, they are not at all alike. In the first episode, when they both visit an apartment which is up for rent, they decide to share.\n\nLopes is a failure: a 34-year-old bachelor who has to share a flat because he has on a \"junk contract\" at R\u00e0dio Bofarull, where he works as an announcer. David is a somewhat spoiled young man who one day decides to break with his life and move out of his parents' house, although he still receives a weekly allowance and takes his house assistant, Carbonell, with him. He is convinced that he has the talent to be an actor and studies at the Institut del Teatre in Barcelona. \n\nThe two men are accompanied by Emma, a girl who lives in a wooden shack located on the roof of the building but uses the men's flat's water, light and heating. \n\nOther recurring characters include Pol, a homosexual acting student and classmate of David who works as a waiter in the Caf\u00e9 Maurici; Ramon, Lopes's colleague on the radio; and Mercedes, the director of R\u00e0dio Bofarull.\n\n==Episodes==\n\nLike many sitcoms, the show's episode titles followed a naming convention: all but four started with the word \"tinc\" meaning \"I have\", and the exceptions to the rule varied only slightly, beginning with words like \"Tenim\" (we have), \"No tinc\" (I don't have) or \"Ho tinc\" (\"I have it\").\n\nThe show's greatest controversy was an episode titled \"Tinc una revelaci\u00f3\" (\"I have a revelation\"), which was censured for some time. In the episode, David develops a [[Messiah complex]] after watching [[The Passion of the Christ]], before finally giving way to temptation in the form of Lopes' visiting female friend. It was not broadcast during the show's reruns or via online platforms. Finally in 2018, after receiving questions from Catalan newspaper [[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]], [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] made the episode available to watch online.\n\nThe show's final episode was \"Tinc Touchdown\" (\"I have a touchdown\") and featured the [[Barcelona Dragons]] American football team. \n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tv3.cat/platsbruts/flash.html Official website]\n* [http://www.tv3.cat/programa/126706100/ Information about Plats Bruts]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352089/ Plats Bruts] [[IMDb]]\n\n[[Category:Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]]\n[[Category:Catalan television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Barcelona]]\n[[Category:Spanish comedy television series]]\n\n\n{{Catalonia-stub}}\n{{comedy-tv-prog-stub}}\n{{spain-tv-prog-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Plats Bruts\n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Sitcom]]\n| camera                   = Multiple Camera\n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| runtime                  = Between 25 - 30 minutes\n| creator                  = [[Joel Joan]] and [[Jordi S\u00e1nchez]]\n| developer                = \n| producer                 = [[Kr\u00e0mpack]], [[El Terrat]] and [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]]\n| executive_producer       = \n| presenter                = \n| starring                 = [[Joel Joan]]<br />[[Jordi S\u00e1nchez (actor)|Jordi S\u00e1nchez]]<br />[[Anna Ma Barbany]]<br />[[M\u00f2nica Glaenzel]]<br />[[Montse P\u00e9rez]]<br />[[Pau Dur\u00e0]]<br />[[Llu\u00eds X.
