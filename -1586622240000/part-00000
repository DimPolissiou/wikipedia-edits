The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding.\n\nObservations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], in [[molecular cloud]]s, in the [[circumstellar dust]] of [[young stellar object]]s, and in [[planetary systems]] such as the [[Solar System]], where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational \u2018snapshots\u2019 of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps.\n\nParameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[magnetic field]] determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior. Therefore, one can learn about where that object came from, and what is (in) the intervening medium.\n\n== Detection methods ==\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Cosmic dust of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] as revealed in infrared light by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].]]\n\nCosmic dust can be detected by indirect methods that utilize the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiative]] properties of the cosmic dust particles.\n\nCosmic dust can also be detected directly ('in-situ') using a variety of collection methods and from a variety of collection locations.

Dust samples are also collected from surface deposits on the large Earth ice-masses (Antarctica and Greenland/the Arctic) and in deep-sea sediments.\n\n[[Donald E. Brownlee|Don Brownlee]] at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the [[meteorite]]s, which contain [[#Stardust|stardust]] extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star.\n\n[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmic dust of the [[Horsehead Nebula]] as revealed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n\nIn interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10\u201340&nbsp;km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on [[Stardust Mission|Stardust]] captured particles intact in low-density [[aerogel]].\n\nDust detectors in the past flew on the [[HEOS-2]], ''[[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'', ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' space missions, on the Earth-orbiting [[LDEF]], [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]], and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' spacecraft as giant [[Langmuir probe]]s to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'', [[PROBA|Proba]], ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'', ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'', and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC.\n\nInfrared light can penetrate cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies.  [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] is the largest infrared telescope yet launched into space.  It was carried by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003.  During its mission, Spitzer obtained images and spectra by detecting the [[thermal radiation]] emitted by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. Findings from the Spitzer have revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. One report showed some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Markwick-Kemper\n |author2=Gallagher, S. C. |author3=Hines, D.

Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarisation]]. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles.\n\nDust particles can scatter light nonuniformly.  [[Forward scatter]]ed light is light that is redirected slightly off its path by [[diffraction]], and [[back-scatter]]ed light is reflected light.\n\nThe scattering and extinction (\"dimming\") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.\n\nThe scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in [[reflection nebula]]e, and gives clues about the individual particle's light-scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that [[Astrophysical X-ray source|astronomical X-ray sources]] would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal|author=Smith RK|author2=Edgar RJ|author3=Shafer RA|title=The X-ray halo of GX 13+1|journal=Astrophys.

Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation|planetary accretion disk]] more than four billion years ago. So-called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. ''Stardust'' is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.<ref>Donald D. Clayton,  Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon & Planets 19, 109 (1978)</ref>\n\nMany different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor-intensive (see [[presolar grains]]).\n\nMany new aspects of [[nucleosynthesis]] have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains.<ref>{{cite journal|author=D.

Prominent are [[silicon carbide]], [[graphite]], [[aluminium oxide]], aluminium [[spinel]], and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a [[supernova]]. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium.\n\nAlso important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the [[isotope]]s could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure [[S-process]] isotopes, fitting their condensation within [[Asymptotic Giant Branch|AGB]] star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements.\n\nAnother dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensate<ref>D. D. Clayton, Moon and Planets 19, 109 (1978)</ref>) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres.

These particles are irregularly shaped, with [[porosity]] ranging from ''fluffy'' to ''compact''. The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse [[interstellar medium]] dust, dust grains in [[interstellar clouds|dense clouds]], [[planetary rings]] dust, and [[circumstellar dust]], are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. ''Interplanetary dust particles'' (IDPs) are generally larger still.\n\n[[File:IDPmajorelements.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Major elements of 200 stratospheric interplanetary dust particles.]]\nMost of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm\u00b3 (with porosity about 40%).

That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1988 | title = Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust | url = | journal = Proceeding of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 637\u201357 | bibcode = 1988LPSC...18..637L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1989 | title = Stochastic evolution of refractory interstellar dust during the chemical evolution of a two-phase interstellar medium | url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1368&context=physastro_pubs| journal = Astrophys.

Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool, oxygen-rich red-giants and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool [[carbon star]]s.  Red giants have evolved or altered off the [[main sequence]] and have entered the [[giant star|giant]] phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. Meteoriticists who study refractory stardust (extracted from meteorites) often call it [[presolar grains]] but that within meteorites is only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, in cases only to be destroyed or split apart by radiation and sublimation into a gas component. Finally, as the Solar System formed many interstellar dust grains were further modified by coalescence and chemical reactions in the planetary accretion disk. The history of the various types of grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.\n\nAstronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Humphreys, Roberta M.| author2=Strecker, Donald W.| author3=Ney, E.

This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter ''a'', the time for a grain to attain ''a'', and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.<ref>[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 147\u2013148]]</ref> On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in [[nova]] and [[supernova]] ejecta, and in [[R Coronae Borealis variable]] stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.\n\nMost dust in the [[Solar System]] is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H<sub>2</sub>. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk.  Some molecules such as CO, N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the \"refractory\" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | last2 = Liu | first2 = W. | last3 = Dalgarno | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Condensation of carbon in radioactive supernova gas | url =https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&context=physastro_pubs | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5406| pages = 1290\u201392 | doi=10.1126/science.283.5406.1290|bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1290C }}</ref> a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae.

Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets.\n\nDue to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and [[amorphous]] components. We can picture an IDP as a \"matrix\" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the [[solar nebula]] and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are [[Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides|GEMS]], [[chondrule]]s, and [[Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions|CAI]]s.\n\n==From the solar nebula to Earth==\n[[File:Grapsdustytrail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A dusty trail from the early Solar System to carbonaceous dust today.]]\nThe arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula.\n\nWe can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements (\"volatile\" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to have been formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain \"matrix\" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Gruen, Eberhard |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System\u2014Interplanetary Dust and the Zodiacal Cloud |date=1999 |pages=XX}}</ref> The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. [[Solar wind]] ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.\n\nBased on 2012 [[computer simulation|computer model studies]], the [[organic compound|complex organic molecules]] necessary for [[life]] ([[Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules|Extraterrestrial organic molecules]]) may have formed in the [[protoplanetary disk]] of dust grains surrounding the [[Sun]] before the formation of the [[Earth]].<ref name=\"Space-20120329\">{{cite web |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |title=Life's Building Blocks May Have Formed in Dust Around Young Sun |url=http://www.space.com/15089-life-building-blocks-young-sun-dust.html |date=29 March 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=30 March 2012 }}</ref>  According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other [[stars]] that acquire [[planets]].<ref name=\"Space-20120329\" />\n\nIn September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to [[Interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] \u2013 \"a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively\".<ref name=\"Space-20120920\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins |url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"AJL-20120901\">{{cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs\u2014Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |number=1 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |pages=L24}}</ref> Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons \"for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]].\"<ref name=\"Space-20120920\" /><ref name=\"AJL-20120901\" />\n\nIn February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a greatly upgraded database<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/|title=NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database|website=www.astrochem.org}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20140221\">{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding.\n\nObservations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], in [[molecular cloud]]s, in the [[circumstellar dust]] of [[young stellar object]]s, and in [[planetary systems]] such as the [[Solar System]], where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational \u2018snapshots\u2019 of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps.\n\nParameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[magnetic field]] determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior.

Brownlee|Don Brownlee]] at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the [[meteorite]]s, which contain [[#Stardust|stardust]] extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star.\n\n[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmic dust of the [[Horsehead Nebula]] as revealed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n\nIn interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10\u201340&nbsp;km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on [[Stardust Mission|Stardust]] captured particles intact in low-density [[aerogel]].\n\nDust detectors in the past flew on the [[HEOS-2]], ''[[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'', ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' space missions, on the Earth-orbiting [[LDEF]], [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]], and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' spacecraft as giant [[Langmuir probe]]s to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'', [[PROBA|Proba]], ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'', ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'', and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC.\n\nInfrared light can penetrate cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies.  [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] is the largest infrared telescope yet launched into space.  It was carried by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003.  During its mission, Spitzer obtained images and spectra by detecting the [[thermal radiation]] emitted by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. Findings from the Spitzer have revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. One report showed some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Markwick-Kemper\n |author2=Gallagher, S. C. |author3=Hines, D.

Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarisation]]. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles.\n\nDust particles can scatter light nonuniformly.  [[Forward scatter]]ed light is light that is redirected slightly off its path by [[diffraction]], and [[back-scatter]]ed light is reflected light.\n\nThe scattering and extinction (\"dimming\") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.\n\nThe scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in [[reflection nebula]]e, and gives clues about the individual particle's light-scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that [[Astrophysical X-ray source|astronomical X-ray sources]] would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal|author=Smith RK|author2=Edgar RJ|author3=Shafer RA|title=The X-ray halo of GX 13+1|journal=Astrophys.

Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation|planetary accretion disk]] more than four billion years ago. So-called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. ''Stardust'' is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.<ref>Donald D. Clayton,  Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon & Planets 19, 109 (1978)</ref>\n\nMany different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor-intensive (see [[presolar grains]]).\n\nMany new aspects of [[nucleosynthesis]] have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains.<ref>{{cite journal|author=D.

Prominent are [[silicon carbide]], [[graphite]], [[aluminium oxide]], aluminium [[spinel]], and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a [[supernova]]. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium.\n\nAlso important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the [[isotope]]s could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure [[S-process]] isotopes, fitting their condensation within [[Asymptotic Giant Branch|AGB]] star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements.\n\nAnother dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensate<ref>D. D. Clayton, Moon and Planets 19, 109 (1978)</ref>) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres.

These particles are irregularly shaped, with [[porosity]] ranging from ''fluffy'' to ''compact''. The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse [[interstellar medium]] dust, dust grains in [[interstellar clouds|dense clouds]], [[planetary rings]] dust, and [[circumstellar dust]], are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. ''Interplanetary dust particles'' (IDPs) are generally larger still.\n\n[[File:IDPmajorelements.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Major elements of 200 stratospheric interplanetary dust particles.]]\nMost of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm\u00b3 (with porosity about 40%).

Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool, oxygen-rich red-giants and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool [[carbon star]]s.  Red giants have evolved or altered off the [[main sequence]] and have entered the [[giant star|giant]] phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. Meteoriticists who study refractory stardust (extracted from meteorites) often call it [[presolar grains]] but that within meteorites is only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, in cases only to be destroyed or split apart by radiation and sublimation into a gas component. Finally, as the Solar System formed many interstellar dust grains were further modified by coalescence and chemical reactions in the planetary accretion disk. The history of the various types of grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.\n\nAstronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Humphreys, Roberta M.| author2=Strecker, Donald W.| author3=Ney, E.

This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter ''a'', the time for a grain to attain ''a'', and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.<ref>[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 147\u2013148]]</ref> On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in [[nova]] and [[supernova]] ejecta, and in [[R Coronae Borealis variable]] stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.\n\nMost dust in the [[Solar System]] is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H<sub>2</sub>. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk.  Some molecules such as CO, N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the \"refractory\" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | last2 = Liu | first2 = W. | last3 = Dalgarno | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Condensation of carbon in radioactive supernova gas | url =https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&context=physastro_pubs | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5406| pages = 1290\u201392 | doi=10.1126/science.283.5406.1290|bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1290C }}</ref> a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae.

Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets.\n\nDue to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and [[amorphous]] components. We can picture an IDP as a \"matrix\" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the [[solar nebula]] and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are [[Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides|GEMS]], [[chondrule]]s, and [[Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions|CAI]]s.\n\n==From the solar nebula to Earth==\n[[File:Grapsdustytrail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A dusty trail from the early Solar System to carbonaceous dust today.]]\nThe arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula.\n\nWe can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements.

Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements (\"volatile\" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to have been formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain \"matrix\" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Gruen, Eberhard |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System\u2014Interplanetary Dust and the Zodiacal Cloud |date=1999 |pages=XX}}</ref> The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. [[Solar wind]] ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays.

In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, West Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for West African communities, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased's father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSpecifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in West Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a \"love touch.\"  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting West African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person's spirit, also known as \"tibo,\" will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/>\n\n===Resistance to Western medicine===\nResistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.<ref name=Gassel/> The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with West African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Due to the mistrust, Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.<ref name=Ravi>{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301\u2013305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|pmid = 25341052|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}</ref> In Sierra Leone, health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.<ref name=Ravi/> In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\nResistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the West African families.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/><ref name=Gassel/> Lastly, the interference in the family's care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family's duty to provide comfort and care.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person's blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\n===Traditional medical practices===\nApart from the fact that traditional West African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the West African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient's skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall West African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\n== Personal account of a West African student==\nAlakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that \"everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place\".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the \"uncivilized\" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were \"protective of their property\", space, and time. She concluded that American society is \"extremely individualistic\". This truly made her miss living in Africa, \"... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAs of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not \"feel like the same place\" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free.

However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song \"White Ebola\" was released by a [[diaspora]] based group and centers on the general distrust of \"outsiders\" who may be intentionally infecting people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|title=A brief background and history of African literatures|publisher=Exploring Africa|accessdate=9 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110050113/http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|archive-date=10 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"culanth592\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|title=Beats, Rhymes and Ebola|publisher=Boima Tucker|accessdate=9 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213223928/https://culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|archive-date=13 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis initial [[misinformation]] increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers, as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: \"No Ebola in West Point.\" Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-workers-battle-trust-issues-attacks-in-ebola-outbreak/|title=Health workers battle trust issues, attacks in Ebola outbreak|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients/|title=Report: Armed men attack Liberia Ebola clinic, freeing patients|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> In [[Guinea]], riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in [[Nzerekore]].

In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, West Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for West African communities, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased's father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSpecifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in West Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a \"love touch.\"  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting West African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person's spirit, also known as \"tibo,\" will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/>\n\n===Resistance to Western medicine===\nResistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.<ref name=Gassel/> The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with West African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Due to the mistrust, Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.<ref name=Ravi>{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301\u2013305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|pmid = 25341052|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}</ref> In Sierra Leone, health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.<ref name=Ravi/> In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\nResistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the West African families.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/><ref name=Gassel/> Lastly, the interference in the family's care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family's duty to provide comfort and care.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person's blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\n===Traditional medical practices===\nApart from the fact that traditional West African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the West African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient's skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.<ref name=\"wesleymc.com\"/> Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall West African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.<ref name=Gassel/>\n\n== Personal account of a West African student==\nAlakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that \"everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place\".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the \"uncivilized\" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were \"protective of their property\", space, and time. She concluded that American society is \"extremely individualistic\". This truly made her miss living in Africa, \"... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAs of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not \"feel like the same place\" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free. Osei now says that \"Freetown has become Fear-town\", and that \"Ebola has turned us into prisoners in our own country\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_ccf50fda-4f0a-11e4-858f-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Student from Sierra Leone tells of cultural impact of Ebola |author=Rosemond Crown<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 8, 2014 |website=Hilltop Views |publisher=Hilltop Views |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016210249/http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_ccf50fda-4f0a-11e4-858f-001a4bcf6878.html |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Bushmeat==\nThe Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to [[bushmeat]], which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source.

These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill.

These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

Fatmag\u00fcl plans to marry her childhood love Mustafa (Firat \u00c7elik), who is a fisherman. They are only waiting for Mustafa to earn much money to finish their house construction before marriage. Then there is the Yasaran family, the rich upper-class business men and their political social elites. Yasaran Family is in Izmir for the engagement ceremony of the son of the elder brother Resat Yasaran (Musa Uzunlar) to the daughter of a politician. Selim (Engin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk) is his son and Erdogan (Kaan Tasaner) his nephew. These cousins have a third friend Vural (Bugra G\u00fclsoy) who also belongs to the upper-class. All these three have spent their childhood in Izmir but as the businesses of their fathers grew, they moved to Istanbul. They have a childhood friend in Izmir, whom they meet on yearly basis when they come there for summer vacations. This fourth friend of theirs is the hero - Kerim Ilgaz (Engin Aky\u00fcrek).\n\nKerim Ilgaz is a well-mannered boy, a blacksmith apprentice by profession, who lives with his aunt Meryem Aksoy (Sumru Yavrucuk), known affectionately as \"Ebe Nine\", who is a homeopath. Kerim was orphaned during childhood so Meryem brought him up as her own son. He works as a carpenter in the workshop of his father's friend. Kerim though unlike his rich friends, is over-powered by their presence. He considers himself important with them and hence, enjoys their company.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl is desperate to be married-off to Mustafa, not only because she loves him but also to get rid away from her nagging sister-in-law. Her desire for Mustafa and an independent married life is growing with time as Muqadas's hatred is growing towards her. Except for Mustafa, she has no one to share her feelings with. While in Izmir, Erdogan, Selim, Vural and Kerim see Fatmagul and the three rich tease her as young boys do. Kerim doesn't like this. Then at Selim's engagement, Keirm comes face-to-face with her as she is working their with her sister-in-law. \n\nThe big event of the season is the engagement of Selim, to the politician Turaner Alag\u00f6z's (Aziz Sarvan) daughter Meltem (Seda G\u00fcven). Kerim after attending Selim's engagement, joins his friends for an after-party. All four go for drinking and drug binge near the sea. Mustafa is leaving for a night fish-catch. Fatmag\u00fcl is coming to see him off. She passes from the area where the drunk boys are singing. Kerim sees her and on recognizing her shouts to his friends 'Guys! Its the same girl'!! Then when she tries to run, Kerim gets hold of her while the other three come near her.\n\nThe tragedy occurs. Fatmag\u00fcl is gang-raped. The four boys are shown to be involved in the crime as she faints when Kerim comes on her. The next morning, a traumatized Fatmag\u00fcl is discovered by Ebe Nine while she is picking herbs. The four boys have already left the crime scene. Kerim drops off Selim and Erdogan at their place and himself goes with Vural to his house. Kerim is left deeply disturbed by the event and is even more distressed to know that the girl has been rescued by his mother. The rich boys are confident in the power of their rich fathers and are sure to be saved. As Muqadas approaches the Yasarans threatening of giving their name to the police (as she had found Selim's engagement ring at the rape-scene), with the course of events, the Yasarans save their sons and forcefully marry Kerim to Fatmag\u00fcl. Kerim accepts the blame of solely raping Fatmag\u00fcl for protecting his friends and also because he believes himself to be guilty. Muqadas is their accomplice in all this. Mustafa is hurt primarily because of his fiance' being raped. He burns their house in front of Fatmag\u00fcl but afterwards believes Yasaran\u2019s false stories of Fatmag\u00fcl being involved in Kerim. Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim's families sell their properties and move to \u0130stanbul to start a new life.\n\nThe story develops in Istanbul. Fatmag\u00fcl hates Kerim. She insults him, abuses him, spits at him, tries to kill him, etc. Kerim is not sure whether he really raped her, as he was drunk and drugged. But Fatmag\u00fcl believes that he did it as his was the last face she saw before fainting. Then Vural who is having little traumas of guilt, tells Kerim what he knows that; Kerim did not rape Fatmagul. In fact, when she laid there, fainted under open sky, he just sat beside her. Kerim tells this to Fatmag\u00fcl. She believes it but it is of no importance for her as she hates him and considers him as much as culprit as the other three. \n\nThings become complicated due to the exploitations of the Ya\u015farans and their unscrupulous lawyer, M\u00fcnir Telci (Murat Daltaban), who wants to protect them, as well as Mustafa, who seeks revenge as he believes that Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl had an affair from the beginning. As a result, both the Ya\u015farans and Mustafa start harassing Kerim, Fatmag\u00fcl and their relatives. Kerim initially wild and exhausted with Fatmag\u00fcl's behavior, is ready to leave her and divorce her as she desires. But when he is leaving, Kerim realizes that he loves Fatmag\u00fcl, and this was love at first sight. Before leaving he writes a letter to her, telling her to move on in her life and that one day he will come and ask for forgiveness from her.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl reads this letter. Later-on the viewers are shown that this was the moment when Fatmag\u00fcl fell in love with Kerim as his words softened her heart for him and she believed in what he wrote to her. Anyways, Kerim returns and then the year long, tough but with a happy-end path of Kerim and Fatmagul starts. \n\nHowever, even after she has already developed a soft corner for him, Fatmag\u00fcl is in a state of self-denial about her feelings for Kerim and when one day she sees Vural hugging him, she believes him still to be in contact with her rapists, which actually is not the reality. In order to prove his innocence and love for her, Kerim files her rape case and asks the police to arrest him, Vural and the Ya\u015farans, after which Fatmag\u00fcl finally accepts his of being honest with her. Mustafa after knowing the truth asks Fatmag\u00fcl to forgive him, but she rejects him. Things take a turn when the Ya\u015farans start threatening Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, trying to quickly finish the case, while also using the greedy and weak Mustafa against them. During the first trial, the Ya\u015farans falsify their testimonies. They also resort to using several bribed witnesses. Vural then is accidentally killed by Mustafa. \n\nIn the second season, Fatmag\u00fcl also confesses her love for Kerim. After the Yasarans forcefully protect Mustafa against Fatmag\u00fcl, he abducts her, stating he loves her more than Kerim and that he regrets leaving her. Kerim eventually rescues his wife and they escape. Mustafa is arrested and imprisoned for his crimes. At the wedding of Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, Mustafa intentionally tries to escape from police custody and is therefore, shot to death. Meanwhile, Selim and Erdo\u011fan surreptitiously move to [[Malta]] where they briefly hide from the authorities. However, they are forced to return to Istanbul after Erdo\u011fan engages in a fight at a nightclub and is arrested. \n\nEventually, Fatmag\u00fcl confronts them in court and they are charged for their part in her rape, essentially bringing down the Ya\u015faran empire. The series ends with Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim expecting their first child. In the final scene, they walk down the street in Izmir holding hands, expressing that their love cannot be shaken despite the difficult challenges they faced and that when a woman is strong like Fatmag\u00fcl and has the support of a strong husband like Kerim, even a crime like 'rape' cannot escape justice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2016|reason=Per [[WP:SLASH]] we do not use slashes when we write articles, because they introduce ambiguities.

Fatmag\u00fcl is about to get married to her childhood love Mustafa (Firat \u00c7elik), who is a fisherman. They are only waiting for Mustafa to earn much money to finish their house construction before marriage. Then there is the Yasaran family, the rich upper-class business men and their political social elites. Yasaran Family is in Izmir for the engagement ceremony of the son of the elder brother Resat Yasaran (Musa Uzunlar) to the daughter of a politician. Selim (Engin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk) is his son and Erdogan (Kaan Tasaner) his nephew. These cousins have a third friend Vural (Bugra G\u00fclsoy) who also belongs to the upper-class. All these three have spent their childhood in Izmir but as the businesses of their fathers grew, they moved to Istanbul. They have a childhood friend in Izmir, whom they meet on yearly basis when they come there for summer vacations. This fourth friend of theirs is the hero - Kerim Ilgaz (Engin Aky\u00fcrek).\n\nKerim Ilgaz is a well-mannered boy, a blacksmith apprentice by profession, who lives with his aunt Meryem Aksoy (Sumru Yavrucuk), known affectionately as \"Ebe Nine\", who is a homeopath. Kerim was orphaned during childhood so Meryem brought him up as her own son. He works as a carpenter in the workshop of his father's friend. Kerim though unlike his rich friends, is over-powered by their presence. He considers himself important with them and hence, enjoys their company. \n\nFatmag\u00fcl is desperate to be married-off to Mustafa, not only because she loves him but also to get rid away from her nagging sister-in-law. Her desire for Mustafa and an independent married life is growing with time as Muqadas's hatred is growing towards her. Except for Mustafa, she has no one to share her feelings with. While in Izmir, Erdogan, Selim, Vural and Kerim see Fatmagul and the three rich tease her as young boys do. Kerim doesn't like this. Then at Selim's engagement, Keirm comes face-to-face with her as she is working their with her sister-in-law. \n\nThe big event of the season is the engagement of Selim, to the politician Turaner Alag\u00f6z's (Aziz Sarvan) daughter Meltem (Seda G\u00fcven). Kerim after attending Selim's engagement, joins his friends for an after-party. All four go for drinking and drug binge near the sea. Mustafa is leaving for a night fish-catch. Fatmag\u00fcl is coming to see him off. She passes from the area where the drunk boys are singing. Kerim sees her and on recognizing her shouts to his friends 'Guys! Its the same girl'!! Then when she tries to run, Kerim gets hold of her while the other three come near her.\n\nThe tragedy occurs. Fatmag\u00fcl is gang-raped. The four boys are shown to be involved in the crime as she faints when Kerim comes on her. The next morning, a traumatized Fatmag\u00fcl is discovered by Ebe Nine while she is picking herbs. The four boys have already left the crime scene. Kerim drops off Selim and Erdogan at their place and himself goes with Vural to his house. Kerim is left deeply disturbed by the event and is even more distressed to know that the girl has been rescued by his mother. The rich boys are confident in the power of their rich fathers and are sure to be saved. As Muqadas approaches the Yasarans threatening of giving their name to the police (as she had found Selim's engagement ring at the rape-scene), with the course of events, the Yasarans save their sons and forcefully marry Kerim to Fatmag\u00fcl. Kerim accepts the blame of solely raping Fatmag\u00fcl for protecting his friends and also because he believes himself to be guilty. Muqadas is their accomplice in all this. Mustafa is hurt primarily because of his fiance' being raped. He burns their house in front of Fatmag\u00fcl but afterwards believes Yasaran\u2019s false stories of Fatmag\u00fcl being involved in Kerim. Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim's families sell their properties and move to \u0130stanbul to start a new life.\n\nThe story develops in Istanbul. Fatmag\u00fcl hates Kerim. She insults him, abuses him, spits at him, tries to kill him, etc. Kerim is not sure whether he really raped her, as he was drunk and drugged. But Fatmag\u00fcl believes that he did it as his was the last face she saw before fainting. Then Vural who is having little traumas of guilt, tells Kerim what he knows that; Kerim did not rape Fatmagul. In fact, when she laid there, fainted under open sky, he just sat beside her. Kerim tells this to Fatmag\u00fcl. She believes it but it is of no importance for her as she hates him and considers him as much as culprit as the other three. \n\nThings become complicated due to the exploitations of the Ya\u015farans and their unscrupulous lawyer, M\u00fcnir Telci (Murat Daltaban), who wants to protect them, as well as Mustafa, who seeks revenge as he believes that Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl had an affair from the beginning. As a result, both the Ya\u015farans and Mustafa start harassing Kerim, Fatmag\u00fcl and their relatives. Kerim initially wild and exhausted with Fatmag\u00fcl's behavior, is ready to leave her and divorce her as she desires. But when he is leaving, Kerim realizes that he loves Fatmag\u00fcl, and this was love at first sight. Before leaving he writes a letter to her, telling her to move on in her life and that one day he will come and ask for forgiveness from her.\n\nFatmag\u00fcl reads this letter. Later-on the viewers are shown that this was the moment when Fatmag\u00fcl fell in love with Kerim as his words softened her heart for him and she believed in what he wrote to her. Anyways, Kerim returns and then the year long, tough but with a happy-end path of Kerim and Fatmagul starts. \n\nHowever, even after she has already developed a soft corner for him, Fatmag\u00fcl is in a state of self-denial about her feelings for Kerim and when one day she sees Vural hugging him, she believes him still to be in contact with her rapists, which actually is not the reality. In order to prove his innocence and love for her, Kerim files her rape case and asks the police to arrest him, Vural and the Ya\u015farans, after which Fatmag\u00fcl finally accepts his of being honest with her. Mustafa after knowing the truth asks Fatmag\u00fcl to forgive him, but she rejects him. Things take a turn when the Ya\u015farans start threatening Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, trying to quickly finish the case, while also using the greedy and weak Mustafa against them. During the first trial, the Ya\u015farans falsify their testimonies. They also resort to using several bribed witnesses. Vural then is accidentally killed by Mustafa. \n\nIn the second season, Fatmag\u00fcl also confesses her love for Kerim. After the Yasarans forcefully protect Mustafa against Fatmag\u00fcl, he abducts her, stating he loves her more than Kerim and that he regrets leaving her. Kerim eventually rescues his wife and they escape. Mustafa is arrested and imprisoned for his crimes. At the wedding of Kerim and Fatmag\u00fcl, Mustafa intentionally tries to escape from police custody and is therefore, shot to death. Meanwhile, Selim and Erdo\u011fan surreptitiously move to [[Malta]] where they briefly hide from the authorities. However, they are forced to return to Istanbul after Erdo\u011fan engages in a fight at a nightclub and is arrested. \n\nEventually, Fatmag\u00fcl confronts them in court and they are charged for their part in her rape, essentially bringing down the Ya\u015faran empire. The series ends with Fatmag\u00fcl and Kerim expecting their first child. In the final scene, they walk down the street in Izmir holding hands, expressing that their love cannot be shaken despite the difficult challenges they faced and that when a woman is strong like Fatmag\u00fcl and has the support of a strong husband like Kerim, even a crime like 'rape' cannot escape justice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2016|reason=Per [[WP:SLASH]] we do not use slashes when we write articles, because they introduce ambiguities. In the list below there are numerous character names divided by slashes. It is unclear if this means that the actor played multiple roles, or if the names are nicknames, or if the names represent married names, etc. If the actors portrayed multiple roles it might be wiser to present the content ordered by Character instead of Cast, with one character on each bulleted line. Character descriptions should briefly explain who the character is and what role they had in the story, and should also present real-world information, like details about casting and leaving the series if relevant.

(1985). ''A Financial Revolution in the Habsburg Netherlands: Renten and Renteniers in the County of Holland, 1515\u20131565''. (University of California Press, 300 pp)</ref><ref>Sylla, Richard (2015). \"Financial Development, Corporations, and Inequality\". (BHC-EBHA Meeting). As [[Richard Sylla]] (2015) notes, \"In modern history, several nations had what some of us call [[financial revolution]]s.... The first was the Dutch Republic four centuries ago.\"</ref> The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) became the first company in history to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the general public. In other words, the VOC was officially the first publicly traded company,<ref>Kaiser, Kevin; Young, S. David (2013): ''The Blue Line Imperative: What Managing for Value Really Means''. (Jossey-Bass, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1118510889}}), p. 26. As Kevin Kaiser & David Young (2013) explain, \"There are other claimants to the title of first public company, including a twelfth-century water mill in France and a thirteenth-century company intended to control the English wool trade, Staple of London. Its shares, however, and the manner in which those shares were traded, did not truly allow public ownership by anyone who happened to be able to afford a share. The arrival of VOC shares was therefore momentous, because as [[Fernand Braudel]] pointed out, it opened up the ownership of companies and the ideas they generated, beyond the ranks of the aristocracy and the very rich, so that everyone could finally participate in ''the speculative freedom of transactions''.\"</ref> because it was the first company ever to be actually [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they did not develop the other ingredients necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate shareholders. As [[Edward Stringham]] (2015) notes, \"companies with transferable shares date back to classical Rome, but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable [[secondary market]] existed (Neal, 1997, p. 61).\"<ref>[[Edward Stringham|Stringham, Edward Peter]]: ''Private Governance: Creating Order in Economic and Social Life''. (Oxford University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780199365166}}), p.42</ref>\n\n== Securities of a company ==\nUsually, the securities of a publicly traded company are owned by many investors while the shares of a [[privately held company]] are owned by relatively few shareholders. A company with many shareholders is not necessarily a publicly traded company. In the United States, in some instances, companies with over 500 shareholders may be required to report under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]; companies that report under the 1934 Act are generally deemed public companies.\n\n=== Advantages ===\nPublic companies possess some advantages over privately held businesses.\n\n* Publicly traded companies are able to raise funds and [[Financial capital|capital]] through the sale (in the primary or secondary market) of shares of [[stock]]. This is the reason publicly traded corporations are important; prior to their existence, it was very difficult to obtain large amounts of capital for private enterprises - significant capital could only come from a smaller set of wealthy investors or banks willing to risk typically large investments. The profit on stock is gained in form of [[dividend]] or [[capital gain]] to the holders.\n* The financial media, analysts, and the public are able to access additional information about the business, since the business is commonly legally bound, and naturally motivated (so as to secure further capital), to [[Annual report|publicly disseminate information regarding the financial status and future of the company]] to its many shareholders and the government.\n* Because many people have a vested interest in the company's success, the company may be more popular or recognizable than a private company.\n* The initial shareholders of the company are able to share risk by selling shares to the public. If one were to hold a 100% share of the company, he or she would have to pay all of the business's debt; however, if an individual were to hold a 50% share, they would only need to pay 50% of the debt. This increases asset liquidity and the company does not need to depend on funding from a bank. For example, in 2013 [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] owned 29.3% of the company's class A shares,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/15/zuckerberg-now-owns-29-3-percent-of-facebook-representing-18-billion/|title=Zuckerberg Now Owns 29.3 Percent Of Facebook\u2019s Class A Shares And This Stake Is Worth $13.6 billion|publisher=}}</ref> which gave him enough voting power to control the business, while allowing Facebook to raise capital from, and distribute risk to, the remaining shareholders. Facebook was a privately held company prior to its [[initial public offering]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081415/if-your-would-have-invested-right-after-facebooks-ipo.asp|title=If You Had Invested Right After Facebook's IPO (FB, TWTR)|first=|last=Investopedia|date=14 August 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n* If some shares are given to managers or other employees, potential conflicts of interest between employees and shareholders (an instance of [[principal-agent problem]]) will be remitted. As an example, in many tech companies, entry-level software engineers are given stock in the company upon being hired (thus they become shareholders). Therefore, the engineers have a vested interest in the company succeeding financially, and are incentivized to work harder and more diligently to ensure that success.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nMany stock exchanges require that publicly traded companies have their accounts regularly [[Financial audit|audited]] by outside auditors, and then publish the accounts to their shareholders. Besides the cost, this may make useful information available to competitors. Various other annual and quarterly reports are also required by law. In the United States, the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] imposes additional requirements. The requirement for audited books is not imposed by the exchange known as OTC Pink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/pink-sheets-ottcb.asp|title=The Over-The-Counter Market: An Introduction To Pink Sheets|last=Devcic|first=John|date=September 21, 2014|website=Investopedia|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.otcmarkets.com/marketplaces/otc-pink|title=Pink: The Open Market|website=OTC Markets|series=The Markets|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref> The shares may be maliciously held by outside shareholders and the original founders or owners may lose benefits and control.\nThe principal-agent problem, or the agency problem is a key weakness of public companies. The separation of a company's ownership and control is especially prevalent in such countries as U.K and U.S.\n\n=== Stockholders ===\nIn the United States, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] requires that firms whose stock is traded publicly report their major [[shareholder]]s each year.<ref name='R000323'/> The reports identify all institutional shareholders (primarily, firms owning stock in other companies), all company officials who own shares in their firm, and any individual or institution owning more than 5% of the firm's stock.<ref name=\"R000323\">{{cite news|url=http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/flaherty/flaherty5.html|title=Myth #5. The Federal Reserve is owned and controlled by foreigners.|work=[[Political Research Associates]]|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== General trend ==\nFor many years, newly created companies were privately held but held [[initial public offering]] to become publicly traded company or to be acquired by another company if they became larger and more profitable or had promising prospects. More  infrequently, some companies \u2014 such as investment banking firm [[Goldman Sachs]] and logistics services provider [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) \u2014 chose to remain privately held for a long period of time after maturity into a profitable company.\n\nHowever, from 1997 to 2012, the number of corporations publicly traded on American stock exchanges dropped 45%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/11/14/daily-circuit-public-corporations/|title=Is it time to rethink public corporations?|date=November 14, 2012|access-date=February 15, 2017|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News}}</ref> According to one observer ([[Gerald F.

This is typically done through a [[leveraged buyout]] and occurs when the buyers believe the securities have been undervalued by investors. In some cases, public companies that are in severe financial distress may also approach a private company or companies to take over ownership and management of the company. One way of doing this would be to make a [[rights issue]] designed to enable the new investor to acquire a [[supermajority]]. With a super-majority, the company could then be relisted, i.e. privatized.\n\nAlternatively, a publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies, with the target company becoming either a [[subsidiary]] or [[joint venture]] of the purchaser(s), or ceasing to exist as a separate entity, its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash, shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both. When the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a [[merger]]. Subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created ''[[wikt:de nova|de novo]]'' \u2014 this often happens in the financial sector. Subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies are not generally considered to be privately held companies (even though they themselves are not publicly traded) and are generally subject to the same reporting requirements as publicly traded companies. Finally, shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures can be (re)-offered to the public at any time \u2014 firms that are sold in this manner are called [[spin-out]]s.\n\nMost industrialized jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations that detail the steps that prospective owners (public or private) must undertake if they wish to take over a publicly traded corporation. This often entails the would-be buyer(s) making a formal offer for each share of the company to shareholders.\n\n== Trading and valuation ==\nThe shares of a publicly traded company are often traded on a [[stock exchange]]. The value or \"size\" of a company is called its [[market capitalization]], a term which is often shortened to \"market cap\". This is calculated as the number of shares outstanding (as opposed to authorized but not necessarily issued) times the price per share. For example, a company with two million shares outstanding and a price per share of US$40 has a market capitalization of US$80&nbsp;million. However, a company's market capitalization should not be confused with the fair market value of the company as a whole since the price per share are influenced by other factors such as the volume of shares traded.  Low trading volume can cause artificially low prices for securities, due to investors being apprehensive of investing in a company they perceive as possibly lacking liquidity.\n\nFor example, if all shareholders were to simultaneously try to sell their shares in the open market, this would immediately create downward pressure on the price for which the share is traded unless there were an equal number of buyers willing to purchase the security at the price the sellers demand. So, sellers would have to either reduce their price or choose not to sell. Thus, the number of trades in a given period of time, commonly referred to as the \"volume\" is important when determining how well a company's market capitalization reflects true fair market value of the company as a whole. The higher the volume, the more the fair market value of the company is likely to be reflected by its market capitalization.\n\nAnother example of the impact of volume on the accuracy of market capitalization is when a company has little or no trading activity and the market price is simply the price at which the most recent trade took place, which could be days or weeks ago. This occurs when there are no buyers willing to purchase the securities at the price being offered by the sellers and there are no sellers willing to sell at the price the buyers are willing to pay. While this is rare when the company is traded on a major stock exchange, it is not uncommon when shares are traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC). Since individual buyers and sellers need to incorporate news about the company into their purchasing decisions, a security with an imbalance of buyers or sellers may not feel the full effect of recent news.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n\n* [[Forbes Global 2000]]\n* [[Government agency]]\n* [[Non-departmental public body]]\n* [[Public limited company|plc, public company under UK legislation]]\n* [[Public bodies]]\n* [[Publicly unlisted company]]\n* [[Regulatory agency]]\n* [[Statutory authority]]\n* [[Statutory corporation]]\n* [[Success trap]]\n* [[UK company law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Public Company}}\n[[Category:Publicly traded companies]]\n[[Category:Types of business entity]]\n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|publicly traded companies|enterprises owned by the state or a state entity|State-owned enterprise|}}\n{{short description|Company that offers its securities for sale to the general public}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]].

The arrival of VOC shares was therefore momentous, because as [[Fernand Braudel]] pointed out, it opened up the ownership of companies and the ideas they generated, beyond the ranks of the aristocracy and the very rich, so that everyone could finally participate in ''the speculative freedom of transactions''.\"</ref> because it was the first company ever to be actually [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they did not develop the other ingredients necessary to produce a fully fledged [[capital market]]: corporate shareholders. As [[Edward Stringham]] (2015) notes, \"companies with transferable shares date back to classical Rome, but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable [[secondary market]] existed (Neal, 1997, p. 61).\"<ref>[[Edward Stringham|Stringham, Edward Peter]]: ''Private Governance: Creating Order in Economic and Social Life''. (Oxford University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780199365166}}), p.42</ref>\n\n== Securities of a company ==\nUsually, the securities of a publicly traded company are owned by many investors while the shares of a [[privately held company]] are owned by relatively few shareholders. A company with many shareholders is not necessarily a publicly traded company. In the United States, in some instances, companies with over 500 shareholders may be required to report under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]; companies that report under the 1934 Act are generally deemed public companies.\n\n=== Advantages ===\nPublic companies possess some advantages over privately held businesses.\n\n* Publicly traded companies are able to raise funds and [[Financial capital|capital]] through the sale (in the primary or secondary market) of shares of [[stock]]. This is the reason publicly traded corporations are important; prior to their existence, it was very difficult to obtain large amounts of capital for private enterprises - significant capital could only come from a smaller set of wealthy investors or banks willing to risk typically large investments. The profit on stock is gained in form of [[dividend]] or [[capital gain]] to the holders.\n* The financial media, analysts, and the public are able to access additional information about the business, since the business is commonly legally bound, and naturally motivated (so as to secure further capital), to [[Annual report|publicly disseminate information regarding the financial status and future of the company]] to its many shareholders and the government.\n* Because many people have a vested interest in the company's success, the company may be more popular or recognizable than a private company.\n* The initial shareholders of the company are able to share risk by selling shares to the public. If one were to hold a 100% share of the company, he or she would have to pay all of the business's debt; however, if an individual were to hold a 50% share, they would only need to pay 50% of the debt. This increases asset liquidity and the company does not need to depend on funding from a bank. For example, in 2013 [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] owned 29.3% of the company's class A shares,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/15/zuckerberg-now-owns-29-3-percent-of-facebook-representing-18-billion/|title=Zuckerberg Now Owns 29.3 Percent Of Facebook\u2019s Class A Shares And This Stake Is Worth $13.6 billion|publisher=}}</ref> which gave him enough voting power to control the business, while allowing Facebook to raise capital from, and distribute risk to, the remaining shareholders. Facebook was a privately held company prior to its [[initial public offering]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081415/if-your-would-have-invested-right-after-facebooks-ipo.asp|title=If You Had Invested Right After Facebook's IPO (FB, TWTR)|first=|last=Investopedia|date=14 August 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n* If some shares are given to managers or other employees, potential conflicts of interest between employees and shareholders (an instance of [[principal-agent problem]]) will be remitted. As an example, in many tech companies, entry-level software engineers are given stock in the company upon being hired (thus they become shareholders). Therefore, the engineers have a vested interest in the company succeeding financially, and are incentivized to work harder and more diligently to ensure that success.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nMany stock exchanges require that publicly traded companies have their accounts regularly [[Financial audit|audited]] by outside auditors, and then publish the accounts to their shareholders. Besides the cost, this may make useful information available to competitors. Various other annual and quarterly reports are also required by law. In the United States, the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] imposes additional requirements. The requirement for audited books is not imposed by the exchange known as OTC Pink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/pink-sheets-ottcb.asp|title=The Over-The-Counter Market: An Introduction To Pink Sheets|last=Devcic|first=John|date=September 21, 2014|website=Investopedia|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.otcmarkets.com/marketplaces/otc-pink|title=Pink: The Open Market|website=OTC Markets|series=The Markets|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref> The shares may be maliciously held by outside shareholders and the original founders or owners may lose benefits and control.\nThe principal-agent problem, or the agency problem is a key weakness of public companies. The separation of a company's ownership and control is especially prevalent in such countries as U.K and U.S.\n\n=== Stockholders ===\nIn the United States, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] requires that firms whose stock is traded publicly report their major [[shareholder]]s each year.<ref name='R000323'/> The reports identify all institutional shareholders (primarily, firms owning stock in other companies), all company officials who own shares in their firm, and any individual or institution owning more than 5% of the firm's stock.<ref name=\"R000323\">{{cite news|url=http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/flaherty/flaherty5.html|title=Myth #5. The Federal Reserve is owned and controlled by foreigners.|work=[[Political Research Associates]]|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== General trend ==\nFor many years, newly created companies were privately held but held [[initial public offering]] to become publicly traded company or to be acquired by another company if they became larger and more profitable or had promising prospects. More  infrequently, some companies \u2014 such as investment banking firm [[Goldman Sachs]] and logistics services provider [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) \u2014 chose to remain privately held for a long period of time after maturity into a profitable company.\n\nHowever, from 1997 to 2012, the number of corporations publicly traded on American stock exchanges dropped 45%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/11/14/daily-circuit-public-corporations/|title=Is it time to rethink public corporations?|date=November 14, 2012|access-date=February 15, 2017|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News}}</ref> According to one observer ([[Gerald F.

This is typically done through a [[leveraged buyout]] and occurs when the buyers believe the securities have been undervalued by investors. In some cases, public companies that are in severe financial distress may also approach a private company or companies to take over ownership and management of the company. One way of doing this would be to make a [[rights issue]] designed to enable the new investor to acquire a [[supermajority]]. With a super-majority, the company could then be relisted, i.e. privatized.\n\nAlternatively, a publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies, with the target company becoming either a [[subsidiary]] or [[joint venture]] of the purchaser(s), or ceasing to exist as a separate entity, its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash, shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both. When the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a [[merger]]. Subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created ''[[wikt:de nova|de novo]]'' \u2014 this often happens in the financial sector. Subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies are not generally considered to be privately held companies (even though they themselves are not publicly traded) and are generally subject to the same reporting requirements as publicly traded companies. Finally, shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures can be (re)-offered to the public at any time \u2014 firms that are sold in this manner are called [[spin-out]]s.\n\nMost industrialized jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations that detail the steps that prospective owners (public or private) must undertake if they wish to take over a publicly traded corporation. This often entails the would-be buyer(s) making a formal offer for each share of the company to shareholders.\n\n== Trading and valuation ==\nThe shares of a publicly traded company are often traded on a [[stock exchange]]. The value or \"size\" of a company is called its [[market capitalization]], a term which is often shortened to \"market cap\". This is calculated as the number of shares outstanding (as opposed to authorized but not necessarily issued) times the price per share. For example, a company with two million shares outstanding and a price per share of US$40 has a market capitalization of US$80&nbsp;million. However, a company's market capitalization should not be confused with the fair market value of the company as a whole since the price per share are influenced by other factors such as the volume of shares traded.  Low trading volume can cause artificially low prices for securities, due to investors being apprehensive of investing in a company they perceive as possibly lacking liquidity.\n\nFor example, if all shareholders were to simultaneously try to sell their shares in the open market, this would immediately create downward pressure on the price for which the share is traded unless there were an equal number of buyers willing to purchase the security at the price the sellers demand. So, sellers would have to either reduce their price or choose not to sell. Thus, the number of trades in a given period of time, commonly referred to as the \"volume\" is important when determining how well a company's market capitalization reflects true fair market value of the company as a whole. The higher the volume, the more the fair market value of the company is likely to be reflected by its market capitalization.\n\nAnother example of the impact of volume on the accuracy of market capitalization is when a company has little or no trading activity and the market price is simply the price at which the most recent trade took place, which could be days or weeks ago. This occurs when there are no buyers willing to purchase the securities at the price being offered by the sellers and there are no sellers willing to sell at the price the buyers are willing to pay. While this is rare when the company is traded on a major stock exchange, it is not uncommon when shares are traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC). Since individual buyers and sellers need to incorporate news about the company into their purchasing decisions, a security with an imbalance of buyers or sellers may not feel the full effect of recent news.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n\n* [[Forbes Global 2000]]\n* [[Government agency]]\n* [[Non-departmental public body]]\n* [[Public limited company|plc, public company under UK legislation]]\n* [[Public bodies]]\n* [[Publicly unlisted company]]\n* [[Regulatory agency]]\n* [[Statutory authority]]\n* [[Statutory corporation]]\n* [[Success trap]]\n* [[UK company law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Public Company}}\n[[Category:Publicly traded companies]]\n[[Category:Types of business entity]]\n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]\n", "name_user": "103.106.242.74", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company"}

It is estimated that over two thousand German soldiers, including numerous teenagers, under the command of German officers but against the [[Geneva Conventions]], removed mines, nearly half of them being either killed or wounded. The removal was part of a controversial agreement between the German Commander General [[Georg Lindemann]], the Danish Government and the British Armed Forces, under which German soldiers with experience in defusing mines would be in charge of clearing the mine fields. Historians have criticised the film for showing German soldiers clearing mines under the command of Danish officers, which never happened.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNDER SANDET - NY FILM AF MARTIN ZANDVLIET|url=http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/FILMupdate/2014/Juni/Under-sandet-ny-film-af-Martin-Zandvliet.aspx#|accessdate=9 November 2015|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://politiken.dk/kultur/art5601303/Historiker-roser-Under-Sandet-selv-om-der-skrues-%C2%BBliiige-lovligt-meget-p%C3%A5-drama-knappen%C2%AB|title=Historiker roser 'Under Sandet' selv om der skrues \u00bbliiige lovligt meget p\u00e5 drama-knappen\u00ab|first=Eva Lange J\u00f8rgensen|last=Journalist|date=3 December 2015|website=Politiken|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and the [[liberation of Denmark]] from [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] in May 1945, the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' evacuates the country. A Danish sergeant, Carl Leopold Rasmussen, furiously beats up a German [[prisoner of war]] for carrying a [[Flag of Denmark|Danish flag]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/danish-postwar-drama-land-of-mine-tells-a-little-known-story/article34048206/|title=Danish postwar drama Land of Mine tells a little known story|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> A group of young German prisoners are handed over to the [[Royal Danish Army|Danish Army]] and sent to the [[Atlantic Wall|west coast]], where they are trained to [[Demining|remove the mines]] that the Germans had buried in the sand. Rasmussen forces the boys to perform the dangerous work with their bare hands. They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and he is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy.\n\nRasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring household treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. Rasmussen begins to grow conflicted in his feelings and Sebastian Schumann, leader of the boys, attempts to remain optimistic; the boys discuss their plans for when they return home.\n\nThe POWs are not given food due to postwar shortages and some begin to suffer from [[malnourishment]]. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a [[field hospital]]. After stealing animal fodder from the nearby farm, the boys are poisoned by rat droppings and Rasmussen forces them to purge themselves with seawater. Afterwards, he begins to treat them more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and reporting that Wilhelm has survived, to maintain morale. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. While clearing the beach, one of the boys forgets to separate a mine's plunger from the detonator.  After Rasmussen stops a group of Allied soldiers from urinating on one of the boys, Ebbe accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother, Ernst, who is in [[denial]], is comforted by Rasmussen.\n\nAfter a casual game of [[soccer|football]], Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly safe zone of the beach.  This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. He relents after seeing Ernst save a little girl from the minefield and then commit suicide by walking onto uncleared sand.  He reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to return. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach of mines, a live mine is accidentally tossed onto a truckload of deactivated mines, setting off a massive chain reaction and killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.\n\nAlthough the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, Ebbe informs Rasmussen that he has ordered the surviving four to be sent to another area, to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map. Rasmussen argues with Ebbe but he refuses to rescind the order. Rasmussen rescues them, drives them within 500 meters of the [[Denmark\u2013Germany border|German border]] and orders them to run to their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Roland M\u00f8ller]] as Sgt.

It is estimated that over two thousand German soldiers, including numerous teenagers, under the command of German officers but against the [[Geneva Conventions]], removed mines, nearly half of them being either killed or wounded. The removal was part of a controversial agreement between the German Commander General [[Georg Lindemann]], the Danish Government and the British Armed Forces, under which German soldiers with experience in defusing mines would be in charge of clearing the mine fields. Historians have criticised the film for showing German soldiers clearing mines under the command of Danish officers, which never happened.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNDER SANDET - NY FILM AF MARTIN ZANDVLIET|url=http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/FILMupdate/2014/Juni/Under-sandet-ny-film-af-Martin-Zandvliet.aspx#|accessdate=9 November 2015|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://politiken.dk/kultur/art5601303/Historiker-roser-Under-Sandet-selv-om-der-skrues-%C2%BBliiige-lovligt-meget-p%C3%A5-drama-knappen%C2%AB|title=Historiker roser 'Under Sandet' selv om der skrues \u00bbliiige lovligt meget p\u00e5 drama-knappen\u00ab|first=Eva Lange J\u00f8rgensen|last=Journalist|date=3 December 2015|website=Politiken|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and the [[liberation of Denmark]] from [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] in May 1945, the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' evacuates the country. A Danish sergeant, Carl Leopold Rasmussen, furiously beats up a German [[prisoner of war]] for carrying a [[Flag of Denmark|Danish flag]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/danish-postwar-drama-land-of-mine-tells-a-little-known-story/article34048206/|title=Danish postwar drama Land of Mine tells a little known story|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> A group of young German prisoners are handed over to the [[Royal Danish Army|Danish Army]] and sent to the [[Atlantic Wall|west coast]], where they are trained to [[Demining|remove the mines]] that the Germans had buried in the sand. Rasmussen forces the boys to perform the dangerous work with their bare hands. They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and he is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy.\n\nRasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring household treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. Rasmussen begins to grow conflicted in his feelings and Sebastian Schumann, leader of the boys, attempts to remain optimistic; the boys discuss their plans for when they return home.\n\nThe POWs are not given food due to postwar shortages and some begin to suffer from [[malnourishment]]. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a [[field hospital]]. After stealing aninal fodder from the nearby farm, the boys are poisoned by rat droppings and Rasmussen forces them to purge themselves with seawater. Afterwards, he begins to treat them more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and reporting that Wilhelm has survived, to maintain morale. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. While clearing the beach, one of the boys forgets to separate a mine's plunger from the detonator.  After Rasmussen stops a group of Allied soldiers from urinating on one of the boys, Ebbe accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother, Ernst, who is in [[denial]], is comforted by Rasmussen.\n\nAfter a casual game of [[soccer|football]], Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly safe zone of the beach.  This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. He relents after seeing Ernst save a little girl from the minefield and then commit suicide by walking onto uncleared sand.  He reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to return. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach of mines, a live mine is accidentally tossed onto a truckload of deactivated mines, setting off a massive chain reaction and killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.\n\nAlthough the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, Ebbe informs Rasmussen that he has ordered the surviving four to be sent to another area, to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map. Rasmussen argues with Ebbe but he refuses to rescind the order. Rasmussen rescues them, drives them within 500 meters of the [[Denmark\u2013Germany border|German border]] and orders them to run to their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Roland M\u00f8ller]] as Sgt.

Usually depicted as pure white, Pegasus is the offspring of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] god [[Poseidon]]. He was foaled by the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]<ref>Medusa, in her archaic [[centaur]]-like form. She appears in the incised relief on a mid-7th century BCE vase from [[Boeotia]] at the [[Louvre]] ([[:File:Perseus Medusa Louvre CA795.jpg|CA795]]), illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford University Press) 1988, fig p 87.</ref> upon her death, when the hero [[Perseus]] decapitated her. Pegasus is the brother of [[Chrysaor]] and the uncle of [[Geryon]].\n\nPegasus was caught by the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]], near the fountain Peirene, with the help of Athena and Poseidon.

The image clearly symbolized a warrior arriving at a battle by air, the same tactics used by [[paratrooper]]s. The square upper-sleeve insignia comprised Bellerophon/Pegasus in light blue on a maroon background.

According to the British Army Website, the insignia was designed by the celebrated East Anglian painter Major [[Edward Seago]] in May 1942. The maroon background on the insignia was later used again by the Airborne Forces when they adopted the famous maroon beret in Summer 1942. The beret was the origin of the German nickname for British airborne troops, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]]. Today's [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] carries on the maroon beret tradition. The selection process for the elite Parachute Regiment is called [[Pegasus Company]] (often abbreviated to \"P Company\").

One source suggests that the insignia was designed by famous English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]], who was wife of the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] (and later the expanded British Airborne Forces), General [[Frederick Browning|Frederick \"Boy\" Browning]]. According to the British Army Website, the insignia was designed by the celebrated East Anglian painter Major [[Edward Seago]] in May 1942. The maroon background on the insignia was later used again by the Airborne Forces when they adopted the famous maroon beret in Summer 1942. The beret was the origin of the German nickname for British airborne troops, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]]. Today's [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] carries on the maroon beret tradition. The selection process for the elite Parachute Regiment is called [[Pegasus Company]] (often abbreviated to \"P Company\"). In 2015 it was announced that the units of [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] would once again use the Pegasus insignia after a 15-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite news |last=Farmer |first=Ben |date=2015-10-22 |title=Paras win 15-year battle to reinstate Pegasus emblem |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11945878/Paras-win-15-year-battle-to-reinstate-Pegasus-emblem.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Operation Deadstick|airborne phase]] of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] on the night of 5\u20136 June 1944, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]] captured all its key objectives in advance of the seaborne assault, including the capture and holding at all costs of a vital bridge over the [[Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer|Caen Canal]], near [[Ouistreham]]. In memory of their tenacity, the bridge has been known ever since as [[Pegasus Bridge]].\n\nThe Tuscan [[National Liberation Committee]] during the German occupation of Italy also had a Pegasus as its emblem. The winged horse is still featured on the Tuscan flag and coat of arms.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n{{Main|Pegasus in popular culture}}\nThe winged horse has provided an instantly recognizable corporate logo or emblem of inspiration.
