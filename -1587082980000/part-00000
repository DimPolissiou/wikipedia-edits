The concept of ''zagranitsa'' influenced Soviet life and culture from the 1950s until the 1980s. It manifested itself in a widespread fascination with Western manufactured goods, films, music, fashion and ideas.\n\n[[Alexei Yurchak]], in his 2006 book ''Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation'', describes ''zagranitsa'' as an \"imaginary elsewhere\" that was \"simultaneously knowable and unattainable, tangible and abstract, mundane and exotic\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2006|p=159}} The idea of ''zagranitsa'' as utopia, at once an aspiration, a negation, and a reflection of the Soviet Union itself, became embedded into Soviet culture and identity.\n\nOnce travel to the [[United States]] became more accessible with [[Perestroika]], the \"imaginary West\" lost its mythical connotations, resulting in disappointment and disillusionment. As [[Svetlana Boym]] writes of the 1985 hit song \"The Last Letter\" (also known as \"Goodbye Amerika\") by Russian rock group [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], bidding farewell to America\u2014 that is, \"the beloved Amerika of Soviet underground culture\u2026 the mythical West of the Russian imagination\"\u2014was as painful as bidding farewell to Soviet culture itself and the \"utopian fantasy land of one's youth\".{{sfn|Boym|1994|p=120}}\n\n==Background==\n\nAccording to [[Maurice Hindus]] (writing in 1953), the word ''zagranitsa'' had always \"exercised a spell\" over ordinary Russians, due to the vastness of the country, the enforced isolationism of living in villages, and the restriction of movement under Soviet rule.{{sfn|Hindus|1953|p=60}} For centuries, Russians had been granted glimpses of ''zagranitsa'' and the West through the \"window\" opened by [[Peter the Great]], as well as the reports of the privileged few who were able to go abroad and the rare appearance of aliens who visited [[Russia]]. The majority of the country remained generally closed to foreign influence until [[World War II]]. The war brought an influx of Western goods into the Soviet Union due to foreign relief efforts and the [[Lend-Lease]] policy enacted in 1941, and the \"traditional hunger for knowledge of the mysterious ''zagranitsa'' was sharpened\".{{sfn|Hindus|1953|p=64}} Hindus writes:\n\n{{quote|Never before had Russians been so conscious of ''zagranitsa'', so close to it, so excited about it, so responsive to it. Never before had ''zagranitsa'' descended on them so concretely\u2026 Now it was not merely to be wondered at, but, however, indirectly, to be seen, felt, tasted; also criticized, admired, talked and talked about.</p>\n|Maurice Hindus, ''Crisis in the Kremlin''{{sfn|Hindus|1953|p=64}} }}\n\nHindus describes the wonder and excitement with which Russians receive Hindus's gifts, everyday items from [[America]]\u2014 tea, coffee, [[Spam (food)|Spam]], cigarettes, and an electric razor. \"'So practical and beautiful,' a woman exclaimed as she fondled a pack [of cigarettes] and then passed it to the schoolmaster's wife. 'It's so beautiful,' added the elderly woman. 'I hate to tear it open.'{{sfn|Hindus|1953|p=61}} The cans that contained Spam would not be thrown away after their contents were consumed, but, rather, they were often re-used in the kitchen or as flower pots. It was partly the good itself but more so its packaging that engendered wonder and admiration, its clear mark of foreignness as an object from an \"imaginary elsewhere\". As Yurchak notes, the desire to possess Western goods, and to keep and display empty packaging and bottles even after they were freed of content, reflected the fact that the link to \"elsewhere\" (represented by the materiality of these objects) mattered more than their tangible utility as \"consumable commodities (the actual liquor, beer, or cigarettes)\". Their unmistakable Western origin was what \"endowed them with great power\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=195}}\n\n==Responses to ''zagranitsa''==\n\nWith the end of the war and the start of the [[Cold War]], officials sought to curb the desire and fascination for the West, which, according to Soviet Minister of Culture [[Andrei Zhdanov]], was a detriment to the national pride of the USSR. In 1946, Zhdanov asked in an address Leningrad: \"Is it for us\u2026 to bow low before everything foreign?\"{{sfn|Hindus|1953|p=121}} Zhdanov's campaigns against \"rootless Cosmopolitanism\" in the early years after the war persecuted progressive composers like [[Shostakovich]] and [[Prokofiev]] who were deemed too sympathetic to the [[bourgeois]] ideologies of the West.\n\nAt the same time the government encouraged citizens to learn to appreciate other forms of foreign culture. For example, learning foreign languages was encouraged as a part of the duties of an educated Soviet citizen, especially with the advent of [[shortwave radio]].{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=176}} Cultural openness and internationalism had long been promoted, which had been contrasted, in propaganda, against the supposed racism and intolerance of the United States. The shortwave radio was promoted as a cultural tool to shape an internationalist perspective on the world. Although certain radio bands receiving from distant stations\u2014 such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-funded [[Radio Liberty]]\u2014 were always \"jammed\" or censored, the permitted bands still could receive from stations such as the [[BBC World Service]], the [[Voice of America]] in English, and [[Radio France International]] in French. Thus, although partially censored, shortwave radios, which were promoted by the government, provided \"windows to the west\" through which Soviet citizens were still able to listen to jazz and rock-and-roll, which were, on the other hand, deemed as \"bad\" Cosmopolitanism by officials.{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=176}}\n\nThe distinction between \"good\" Internationalism and \"bad\" Cosmopolitanism and the line between acceptable and unacceptable practice were often ambiguous and determined on a case-by-case basis, so in general the verdicts on foreign cultural forms and influences were open to interpretation. This ambiguity allowed interest in ''zagranitsa'' to continue as an acceptable part of everyday life. According to [[Vassily Aksyonov]], the \"combination of vague pro-American feelings and an all-out anti-American propaganda campaign caused a certain segment of Soviet society to start leaning unconsciously in the direction of America in matters aesthetic, emotional, and even to some extent ideological.{{sfn|Aksyonov|1987|p=16}} The 1960s saw a huge increase of interest in foreign languages and philosophies, American literature, and avant-garde jazz as well as a new-found fascination with traveling to exotic \"elsewheres,\" with increased interest in the \"practices of hiking, mountaineering, and going on geological expeditions in the remote nature reserves of [[Siberia]], the Far East and the North\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=160}}\n\n==As a model==\n\nThe official ambiguity toward ''zagranitsa'' was sustained by the fact that the West was often held up as a model for Soviet emulation. As Susan Reid notes, during the 1950s, even as the Socialist way of life was proclaimed as the \"right\" path toward prosperity, \"the Soviet Union also entered into competition on terms set by the US\u2026 The regime couched its promises of economic growth in terms of 'catching up with and surpassing America'. In his address at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] stated: \"We can learn something. We look at the American exhibition as an exhibition of our own achievements in the near future\".{{sfn|Reid|2008|p=160}} Reid noted, \"[the exhibition] was an instructive museum of the future from which to glean new processes and technologies on which to build Soviet, socialist prosperity\".{{sfn|Reid|2008|p=160}} Thus the achievements were held up as a kind of Utopian inspiration for the USSR; the perceived competition with the West was inextricably linked with the goals and aspirations of the Soviet Union itself, whose ultimate goal, [[Communism]], thus became intertwined with Western modes of prosperity and [[consumerism]]. ''Zagranitsa'' and the West became embedded in the model of Socialist Utopia during the second half of the Soviet period.\n\nIt was essential, although perhaps not apparent at the time, that ''zagranitsa'' and the West inevitably functioned as a kind of negation of the Soviet experiment, as it offered an alternative vision of prosperity that was possible without violent world revolution and socialism\u2014and thus was the antithesis to a Soviet Union founded on [[Marxism]].{{sfn| Aksyonov|1989|p=11}} The persistent and prominent images of American capitalist prosperity proved to be an important part of Socialism's undoing.{{sfn|Reid|2008|p=161}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Music===\n\nDuring the war years, American [[jazz]] became associated with the opening of the second front in 1944 and anticipated victory over the [[Nazis]]. Army bands learned jazz on the front and performed them at dance halls in [[Prague]], [[Krakow]], and [[Leningrad]] after the war. However, American jazz, deemed \"Cosmopolitan,\" soon came under attack by the government, despite its roots in black culture. This, according to Yurchak, was representative of the ambiguity and changing standards of what was acceptable and unacceptable, as the integrity of jazz was not assessed by its social class, the usual metric.{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=166}}\n\n{{quote|jazz was secret weapon number one.\" Its influence, especially on Soviet youth, was substantial in fostering pro-Western feeling:\n\n\"Every night the Voice of America would beam a two-hour jazz program at the Soviet Union from Tangiers. The snatches of music and bits of information made for a kind of golden glow over the horizon when the sun went down, that is, in the West, the inaccessible but oh so desirable West. How many dreamy Russian boys came to puberty to the strains of [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'s \"Take the A Train\"\u2026We taped the music on antediluvian recorders and played it over and over at semiunderground parties, which often ended in fistfights with [[Komsomol]] patrols or even police raids.\" |Vassily Aksyonov, ''In Search of Melancholy Baby''{{sfn| Aksyonov|1989|p=18}} }}\n\nAlthough it was publicly criticized, denounced, and listening was made an illicit activity, jazz continued to exist officially in concerts held by state organizations, for example, by Komsomol committees, as long as it was \"adapted to fit the Soviet context\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=167}} The success with which jazz had actually been adapted is questionable, however. Even when imbued with Soviet melodies or with alternative lyrics, jazz (and [[Rock and roll|rock-and-roll]]) elicited \"overly excited\" reactions from young people, engendered by their associations with ''zagranitsa''. These forms could not be completely dissociated from its associations with the West, but they did acquire their own meanings and significance for the Soviet generation that grew up listening to them.\n\n===Fashion===\n\nThe desire for ''zagranitsa'' also manifested itself in the style movement of the ''stilyagi'' (plural of ''stilyaga,'' meaning \"stylish\" or \"style-hunter\") that emerged from the 1940s. ''Stilyagi'' were Soviet youths who adopted an aesthetic style inspired by American films shown in Soviet theatres. Their clothes were marked by loud patterns and colors and tight fits.\n\nOften, because the clothes could not be found in Soviet stores, ''stilyagi'' made their own clothes.{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=171}} Some American clothes from Lend-Lease could be found in Soviet secondhand shops. Still others bought their clothing from ''fartsovshchiks'', people who dealt in the illegal business of acquiring and selling foreign goods and currency. ''Stilyagi'' listened to jazz and rock-and-roll, and frequented clubs like Hotel Evropeiskaia in Leningrad, which featured the Yosif Vainshtein orchestra and played American swing melodies.\n\nHowever, as Yurchak writes, the ''stilyagi'' were a small subculture, and the majority of Soviet Youth looked on ''stilyagi'' with disdain. The perception of ''<u>stilyagi</u>'' was that they were shallow and \"uneducated loafers\" who knew \"fashions from all over the world\" but not [[Griboyedov, Armenia|Griboyedov]].{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=172}}\n\nKomsomol members and even the police suppressed gatherings of ''stilyagi''. However, the government's attack on these more extreme manifestations of Western influence left alone those who less conspicuously enjoyed ''zagranitsa''. Even during the Stalin years, the Soviet citizen had been encouraged to enjoy consumption of personal, 'bourgeois', pleasures such as dresses, wristwatches and lipstick as long as they were not used to elevate egoism or status, but as a reward for hard work. Thus, only the splashiest aesthetic pursuits of ''zagranitsa'' were hindered, while the many Soviet citizens who continued to engage with Western culture in fashion, music, films, and literature in less ostentatious ways escaped criticism.\n\n==Disillusionment==\n\nThe ''zagranitsa'' of the late Soviet period was an imaginary place, constructed from pieces of Western culture from films, jazz and rock-and-roll vinyls, and the glossy pages of magazines, the imaginings of a distant \"abroad\". Aksyonov describes the perception he had had of America as \"impossibly idealized and distorted\".{{sfn| Aksyonov|1989|p=19}} Partly because ''zagranitsa'' was \"forbidden fruit\", it had been desired and idealized.\n\nHowever, when Soviets came into real contact with the West, the result was often surprise and disappointment. In the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, which famously displayed a 'slice' of the American way of life in its kitchen exhibition, some Soviet spectators reacted with ambivalence and disappointment:\n\n{{quote|We expected that the American exhibition would show something grandiose, some earthly equivalent to Soviet sputniks. But you Americans want to amaze us with the glitter of your kitchen pans and the fashions which do not appeal to us at all.\n\nAnd this is one of the greatest nations?? I feel sorry for the Americans, judging by your exhibition. Does your life really consist only of kitchens? |Susan Reid,\"'Our Kitchen Is Just As Good: Soviet Responses to the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959\"{{sfn|Reid|2008|p=160}} }}\n\nWith Perestroika, the United States and the West became more accessible to Soviet citizens and suddenly \"it became obvious that the Imaginary West was something very different from the real West\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=15}} This realization forced a reevaluation of the late Soviet period and of Soviet identity in general. The theme of disillusionment with the imaginary abroad is presented in several post-Soviet films, including ''[[Stilyagi]]'' (2008) (''Hipsters'' in English) directed by [[Valery Todorovsky]] and ''You Are My Only One'' (1993), directed by Dmitry Astrakhan.{{sfn|Lawton|2004|p=190}} Lawton notes that the theme of realization of ''zagranitsa'' as imaginary in these films usually strikes a patriotic note as protagonists learn to choose their real, if imperfect homelands over imagined foreign utopias.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=l8TnAAAAMAAJ}}|title=In Search of Melancholy Baby|last= Aksyonov|first=Vassily|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=1989|isbn=978-0-394-75992-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g6qM4fQy7YoC}}|title=Common Places: Mythologies of Everyday Life in Russia|last1=Boym|first1=Svetlana|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02864-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZHVBAAAAIAAJ}}|title=Crisis in the Kremlin|last=Hindus|first=Maurice Gerschon|publisher=Doubleday|year=1953|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RUuNQRA9mRsC}}|title=Imaging Russia 2000: Film and Facts|last=Lawton|first=Anna M.|publisher=New Academia Publishing, LLC|year=2004|isbn=978-0-9744934-3-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last1=Crowley|editor-first1=David|editor-last2=Pavitt|editor-first2=Jane|title=Cold War Modern: Design 1945-1970|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gkHrAAAAMAAJ}}|date=1 January 2008|publisher=V&A Publishing|isbn=978-1-85177-570-5|ref=harv|last=Reid|first=Susan E. |chapter=Our Kitchen is Just as Good': Soviet Responses to the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1950|pp=154\u2013161}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iZccAAAAQBAJ}}|title=Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation|last=Yurchak|first=Alexei|date=7 August 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4910-9|ref=harv}}\n\n[[Category:Soviet phraseology]]\n[[Category:1980s in the Soviet Union]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Zagranitsa''''' ({{lang-rus|\u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430|p=z\u0259\u0261r\u0250\u02c8n\u02b2it\u0361s\u0259}}; {{translation}} \"across the border\" or \"abroad\") refers to the real and imagined borders of an idealized, imaginary West that lay beyond the borders of the [[Soviet Union]] during the late Soviet period.

In the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, which famously displayed a 'slice' of the American way of life in its kitchen exhibition, some Soviet spectators reacted with ambivalence and disappointment:\n\n{{quote|We expected that the American exhibition would show something grandiose, some earthly equivalent to Soviet sputniks. But you Americans want to amaze us with the glitter of your kitchen pans and the fashions which do not appeal to us at all.\n\nAnd this is one of the greatest nations?? I feel sorry for the Americans, judging by your exhibition. Does your life really consist only of kitchens? |Susan Reid,\"'Our Kitchen Is Just As Good: Soviet Responses to the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959\"{{sfn|Reid|2008|p=160}} }}\n\nWith Perestroika, the United States and the West became more accessible to Soviet citizens and suddenly \"it became obvious that the Imaginary West was something very different from the real West\".{{sfn|Yurchak|2013|p=15}} This realization forced a reevaluation of the late Soviet period and of Soviet identity in general. The theme of disillusionment with the imaginary abroad is presented in several post-Soviet films, including ''[[Stilyagi]]'' (2008) (''Hipsters'' in English) directed by [[Valery Todorovsky]] and ''You Are My Only One'' (1993), directed by Dmitry Astrakhan.{{sfn|Lawton|2004|p=190}} Lawton notes that the theme of realization of ''zagranitsa'' as imaginary in these films usually strikes a patriotic note as protagonists learn to choose their real, if imperfect homelands over imagined foreign utopias.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=l8TnAAAAMAAJ}}|title=In Search of Melancholy Baby|last= Aksyonov|first=Vassily|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=1989|isbn=978-0-394-75992-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g6qM4fQy7YoC}}|title=Common Places: Mythologies of Everyday Life in Russia|last1=Boym|first1=Svetlana|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02864-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZHVBAAAAIAAJ}}|title=Crisis in the Kremlin|last=Hindus|first=Maurice Gerschon|publisher=Doubleday|year=1953|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RUuNQRA9mRsC}}|title=Imaging Russia 2000: Film and Facts|last=Lawton|first=Anna M.|publisher=New Academia Publishing, LLC|year=2004|isbn=978-0-9744934-3-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last1=Crowley|editor-first1=David|editor-last2=Pavitt|editor-first2=Jane|title=Cold War Modern: Design 1945-1970|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gkHrAAAAMAAJ}}|date=1 January 2008|publisher=V&A Publishing|isbn=978-1-85177-570-5|ref=harv|last=Reid|first=Susan E. |chapter=Our Kitchen is Just as Good': Soviet Responses to the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1950|pp=154\u2013161}}\n* {{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iZccAAAAQBAJ}}|title=Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation|last=Yurchak|first=Alexei|date=7 August 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4910-9|ref=harv}}\n\n[[Category:Soviet phraseology]]\n[[Category:1980s in the Soviet Union]]\n", "name_user": "Catgirl7059", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made the first-sentence definition more precise and concise.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagranitsa"}

It is at the north end of San Jos\u00e9 where it meets the southern end of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and borders the cities of [[Milpitas]], [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], and [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].\n\nThe [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]] and [[Coyote Creek (Santa Clara County)|Coyote Creek]] both end at Alviso, emptying into the Bay through Alviso Slough and Mud Slough.

The community was named for [[Ignacio Alviso]], the son of Corporal Domingo Alviso, one of the original members of the [[De Anza Expedition|de Anza]] expedition. Corporal Alviso lived but a short time after reaching San Francisco and was buried March 11, 1777<ref>{{cite web|first=Ron |last=Filion |url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/spanish/anzaexp.htm |title=Members of the Anza Expedition: Individual Profiles |publisher=SFGenealogy.com |accessdate= 2013-06-26}}</ref> Alviso's descendants were granted the [[Rancho Rincon de Los Esteros]] holding. In 1840, his descendant of the same name, Ignacio Alviso, moved from [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] to this {{convert|3,653|acre|km2}} ranchero. From this port, [[North American beaver|beaver]] pelts, cattle hides and tallow went to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Revised and Expanded Cruising Guide to San Francisco Bay |author=Caroline Mehaffy |author2=Bob Mehaffy |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Paradise Cay Publications |location=Arcata, California |year=1999 |page=155 |isbn=978-0-939837-31-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe city of Alviso was incorporated on March 4, 1852, as the boating and shipping port of San Jos\u00e9 and the transportation hub for the Santa Clara Valley to the San Francisco Bay. Steamboats traveled regularly between San Francisco and Alviso. That usage declined with the growth in [[railroad]] transportation between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and San Jos\u00e9. In 1864 Alviso was bypassed by the [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad]], (later part of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]). However, in the 1880s Alviso was a stop on the [[Newark, California|Newark]] line of Southern Pacific Railroad between San Jos\u00e9 and [[Oakland]].\n\nAlviso was the home to a series of several successful business ventures. Alviso Mills, founded in 1853, at its peak produced up to 300 barrels of flour a day. As wheat production in the San Joaqu\u00edn Valley grew, production in the Santa Clara Valley waned and the Alviso Mills closed in 1885. In 1906, Sai Yin Chew opened the Bayside Canning Company there, and at its peak was the 3rd largest cannery in the United States. During [[The Depression]] Alviso was known for its dance halls and gambling establishments. In the 1960s and 1970s a small independent boat building community developed there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historysanjose.org/neighborhoods/alviso/index.html |title=History of Alviso |publisher=HistorySanJose.org |accessdate=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623175609/http://www.historysanjose.org/neighborhoods/alviso/index.html |archive-date=2014-06-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city ceased to exist when it was consolidated with the City of San Jose on March 12, 1968, following a 189 to 180 vote in favor of consolidation. The city's final [[U.S. Census Bureau|census]] was in 1960 when it recorded a population of 1,174.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/html/demograp/reportspapers/censussurveys/census%2Dhistorical/documents/calhist2.xls |title=Historical US Census Populations of Places, Towns, and Cities in California |publisher=California Department of Finance |accessdate=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428064209/http://www.dof.ca.gov/html/demograp/reportspapers/censussurveys/census%2Dhistorical/documents/calhist2.xls |archive-date=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The [[United States Postal Service]] still recognizes \"Alviso\" as a place name. Mail is not delivered in Alviso, but must be picked up at the post office.\n\nAfter the 1970s, Alviso was treated like a socioeconomic backwater of the prospering [[Silicon Valley]] and struggled to restore its former vitality. On October 9, 1973,\n{{convert|9|acre}} were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Clara County, California]] as site 73000449 under the name Alviso Historic District. The listing cited 11 historic structures and alternative name Embarcadero de Santa Clara, although exact boundaries were not disclosed.<ref name=\"nris\"/> The floods of the early 1980s were devastating to Alviso, especially because Alviso is below sea level and is on marshland. Water was as much as 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) deep in some locations. A number of homes and businesses were destroyed. Some of the picturesque character of the town was lost.\n\nShipping and industry have left Alviso, leaving it mostly as a small residential neighborhood. Digital video recorder company [[TiVo]] and [[Polycom]] have their corporate headquarters in Alviso. Many [[salt evaporation pond]]s formerly owned by [[Cargill]] in the neighborhood are being converted to [[wetlands]] as part of the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe [[Bureau of the Census]] provides demographic information for the 95002 Zip Code Tabulation Area, which includes the former City of Alviso.

Dogs are allowed in the County Park's pathways and picnic areas, but are not allowed on the trails, levees and boardwalks.

Located along the Pacific Flyway, the Refuge hosts over 280 species of birds each year.

Today, hundreds of thousands of people visit the Refuge each year to enjoy its diverse wildlife and habitats.\n\nThe Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is part of a complex made up of six other wildlife refuges in the San Francisco Bay Area. Founded in 1974 and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, It was renamed Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in 1995 in recognition of [[Don Edwards|Congressman Don Edwards']] efforts to protect sensitive wetlands in south San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.fws.gov/refuge/don_edwards_san_francisco_bay/ | title= Don Edwards San Francisco Bay | work= National Wildlife Refuges | publisher= U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service | accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n===Drawbridge ===\n{{main|Drawbridge, California}}\nAlviso has a ghost town named Drawbridge.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ronald |last=Horii |url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/baytrail/vtour/map3/access/BTAlviso/Btalviso1.htm |title=Alviso: Town and Slough |publisher=Abag.ca.gov |accessdate=2013-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603120402/http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/baytrail/vtour/map3/access/BTAlviso/Btalviso1.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2013 }}</ref> Hunters and fisherman came to the island by train in the 1870s, and many never left.

Officials and the board of directors were all of Chinese ancestry. After the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, the Precita Canning Company moved to Alviso, and reorganized under the name of the Bay Side Canning Company.\n\nThe company rented the Alviso Watch Factory building and later bought the premises. Surrounding land was bought to build warehouses, cabins, and boarding houses for the laborers. A two-story building was built to house 100 Chinese American laborers who came from the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe Bay Side Canning Company plant at Alviso started operations with primitive canning methods and equipment, of which most was hand-made. Steam was supplied by old, donkey-type boilers; open vats were used in processing fruits and vegetables. Hand seamers and hand soldering were used in canning the processed food.\n\nThomas Foon Chew, son of Sai Yin Chew, began working for his father in 1906. Due to his progressive ideas, the cannery began a period of rapid growth that made it the third largest cannery in the United States at the time. Only Del Monte and Libby were larger. Chew devised a method for washing tomato boxes before their return to the fields, and he bought a tugboat and a barge to transport goods. He also bought land near Yuba City, Sutter County, to grow peaches, and near Dos Palos, Merced County, for rice. When Thomas Foon Chew died in 1931, his funeral attracted 25,000 people and was said to have been the largest in San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\nRaw products were delivered to the cannery by horses and wagons from the Santa Clara Valley. More distant products came by train or boat from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Delta. Commodities canned at the Alviso plant were spinach, asparagus, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches, pears, tomatoes, catsup, tomato sauce, hot sauce, tomato puree, fish sauce, fruits for salad, vegetables for salad, and fruit cocktail.\n\nThe Isleton Plant in Sacramento County was built in 1919 for canning spinach and asparagus, and in 1921, Bay Side began canning green, rather than white, asparagus. The Mayfield Plant in Santa Clara County was built around 1924. The Alviso plant was sold in 1936, but some of the innovative ideas developed by employees of Bayside Canning Company are still used by most modern canneries.\"\n\n===The Laine Store===\nThe Laine Store at 996 Elizabeth Street, was run by the Tilden family from 1865 to 1912. In the 1920s it became a Chinese gambling hall.<ref name=\"ghosttown.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghosttown.info/ca/alviso/index.html |title=Alviso, CA |publisher=Ghosttown.info |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> After the 1983 flood, the store was abandoned and fell into disrepair.

His parents were migrant agricultural workers. He has been a resident of Orange County, California for over 35 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!-- items in this section are potential reference candidates

the same name. It is at the north end of San Jos\u00e9 where it meets the southern end of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and borders the cities of [[Milpitas]], [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], and [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].\n\nThe [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]] and [[Coyote Creek (Santa Clara County)|Coyote Creek]] both end at Alviso, emptying into the Bay through Alviso Slough and Mud Slough. Alviso is the lowest point in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] at {{convert|13|ft}} below sea level.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_27182429/san-jose-overwhelmed-pumps-led-alviso-flooding-residents|title = San Jose: Overwhelmed pumps led to Alviso flooding; residents say it's a 'wake-up call'|last = Kurhi|first = Eric|date = 2014-12-11|work = newspaper|access-date = 2015-02-13}}</ref> Throughout the 20th Century, Alviso has been victim to severe flooding most recently in 1983 and 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.grpg.org/flood-control|title = Flood Control|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-13|website = Guadalupe River Park Conservancy|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlviso was first settled in the 18th century. The community was named for [[Ignacio Alviso]], the son of Corporal Domingo Alviso, one of the original members of the [[De Anza Expedition|de Anza]] expedition. Corporal Alviso lived but a short time after reaching San Francisco and was buried March 11, 1777<ref>{{cite web|first=Ron |last=Filion |url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/spanish/anzaexp.htm |title=Members of the Anza Expedition: Individual Profiles |publisher=SFGenealogy.com |accessdate= 2013-06-26}}</ref> Alviso's descendants were granted the [[Rancho Rincon de Los Esteros]] holding. In 1840, his descendant of the same name, Ignacio Alviso, moved from [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] to this {{convert|3,653|acre|km2}} ranchero. From this port, [[North American beaver|beaver]] pelts, cattle hides and tallow went to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Revised and Expanded Cruising Guide to San Francisco Bay |author=Caroline Mehaffy |author2=Bob Mehaffy |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Paradise Cay Publications |location=Arcata, California |year=1999 |page=155 |isbn=978-0-939837-31-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe city of Alviso was incorporated on March 4, 1852, as the boating and shipping port of San Jos\u00e9 and the transportation hub for the Santa Clara Valley to the San Francisco Bay. Steamboats traveled regularly between San Francisco and Alviso. That usage declined with the growth in [[railroad]] transportation between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and San Jos\u00e9. In 1864 Alviso was bypassed by the [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad]], (later part of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]). However, in the 1880s Alviso was a stop on the [[Newark, California|Newark]] line of Southern Pacific Railroad between San Jos\u00e9 and [[Oakland]].\n\nAlviso was the home to a series of several successful business ventures. Alviso Mills, founded in 1853, at its peak produced up to 300 barrels of flour a day. As wheat production in the San Joaqu\u00edn Valley grew, production in the Santa Clara Valley waned and the Alviso Mills closed in 1885. In 1906, Sai Yin Chew opened the Bayside Canning Company there, and at its peak was the 3rd largest cannery in the United States. During [[The Depression]] Alviso was known for its dance halls and gambling establishments. In the 1960s and 1970s a small independent boat building community developed there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historysanjose.org/neighborhoods/alviso/index.html |title=History of Alviso |publisher=HistorySanJose.org |accessdate=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623175609/http://www.historysanjose.org/neighborhoods/alviso/index.html |archive-date=2014-06-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city ceased to exist when it was consolidated with the City of San Jose on March 12, 1968, following a 189 to 180 vote in favor of consolidation. The city's final [[U.S. Census Bureau|census]] was in 1960 when it recorded a population of 1,174.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/html/demograp/reportspapers/censussurveys/census%2Dhistorical/documents/calhist2.xls |title=Historical US Census Populations of Places, Towns, and Cities in California |publisher=California Department of Finance |accessdate=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428064209/http://www.dof.ca.gov/html/demograp/reportspapers/censussurveys/census%2Dhistorical/documents/calhist2.xls |archive-date=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The [[United States Postal Service]] still recognizes \"Alviso\" as a place name. Mail is not delivered in Alviso, but must be picked up at the post office.\n\nAfter the 1970s, Alviso was treated like a socioeconomic backwater of the prospering [[Silicon Valley]] and struggled to restore its former vitality. On October 9, 1973,\n{{convert|9|acre}} were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Clara County, California]] as site 73000449 under the name Alviso Historic District. The listing cited 11 historic structures and alternative name Embarcadero de Santa Clara, although exact boundaries were not disclosed.<ref name=\"nris\"/> The floods of the early 1980s were devastating to Alviso, especially because Alviso is below sea level and is on marshland. Water was as much as 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) deep in some locations. A number of homes and businesses were destroyed. Some of the picturesque character of the town was lost.\n\nShipping and industry have left Alviso, leaving it mostly as a small residential neighborhood. Digital video recorder company [[TiVo]] and [[Polycom]] have their corporate headquarters in Alviso. Many [[salt evaporation pond]]s formerly owned by [[Cargill]] in the neighborhood are being converted to [[wetlands]] as part of the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe [[Bureau of the Census]] provides demographic information for the 95002 Zip Code Tabulation Area, which includes the former City of Alviso.

Located along the Pacific Flyway, the Refuge hosts over 280 species of birds each year. Millions of shorebirds and waterfowl stop to refuel at the Refuge during the spring and fall migration. \nIn addition to its seasonal visitors, the Refuge provides critical habitat to resident species like the endangered [[Ridgway's rail]] and [[salt marsh harvest mouse]]. Today, hundreds of thousands of people visit the Refuge each year to enjoy its diverse wildlife and habitats.\n\nThe Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is part of a complex made up of six other wildlife refuges in the San Francisco Bay Area. Founded in 1974 and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, It was renamed Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in 1995 in recognition of [[Don Edwards|Congressman Don Edwards']] efforts to protect sensitive wetlands in south San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.fws.gov/refuge/don_edwards_san_francisco_bay/ | title= Don Edwards San Francisco Bay | work= National Wildlife Refuges | publisher= U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service | accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n===Drawbridge ===\n{{main|Drawbridge, California}}\nAlviso has a ghost town named Drawbridge.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ronald |last=Horii |url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/baytrail/vtour/map3/access/BTAlviso/Btalviso1.htm |title=Alviso: Town and Slough |publisher=Abag.ca.gov |accessdate=2013-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603120402/http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/baytrail/vtour/map3/access/BTAlviso/Btalviso1.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2013 }}</ref> Hunters and fisherman came to the island by train in the 1870s, and many never left.

Officials and the board of directors were all of Chinese ancestry. After the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, the Precita Canning Company moved to Alviso, and reorganized under the name of the Bay Side Canning Company.\n\nThe company rented the Alviso Watch Factory building and later bought the premises. Surrounding land was bought to build warehouses, cabins, and boarding houses for the laborers. A two-story building was built to house 100 Chinese American laborers who came from the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe Bay Side Canning Company plant at Alviso started operations with primitive canning methods and equipment, of which most was hand-made. Steam was supplied by old, donkey-type boilers; open vats were used in processing fruits and vegetables. Hand seamers and hand soldering were used in canning the processed food.\n\nThomas Foon Chew, son of Sai Yin Chew, began working for his father in 1906. Due to his progressive ideas, the cannery began a period of rapid growth that made it the third largest cannery in the United States at the time. Only Del Monte and Libby were larger. Chew devised a method for washing tomato boxes before their return to the fields, and he bought a tugboat and a barge to transport goods. He also bought land near Yuba City, Sutter County, to grow peaches, and near Dos Palos, Merced County, for rice. When Thomas Foon Chew died in 1931, his funeral attracted 25,000 people and was said to have been the largest in San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\nRaw products were delivered to the cannery by horses and wagons from the Santa Clara Valley. More distant products came by train or boat from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Delta. Commodities canned at the Alviso plant were spinach, asparagus, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches, pears, tomatoes, catsup, tomato sauce, hot sauce, tomato puree, fish sauce, fruits for salad, vegetables for salad, and fruit cocktail.\n\nThe Isleton Plant in Sacramento County was built in 1919 for canning spinach and asparagus, and in 1921, Bay Side began canning green, rather than white, asparagus. The Mayfield Plant in Santa Clara County was built around 1924. The Alviso plant was sold in 1936, but some of the innovative ideas developed by employees of Bayside Canning Company are still used by most modern canneries.\"\n\n===The Laine Store===\nThe Laine Store at 996 Elizabeth Street, was run by the Tilden family from 1865 to 1912.

They were initially assisted by the Ngarrindjeri people, until a misunderstanding or disagreement led to the murders.
