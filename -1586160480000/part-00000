Do not restrain or hold a child during a convulsion.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n*Position the child on his or her side or stomach to prevent choking.  When possible, gently remove any objects from the child's mouth. Nothing should ever be placed in the child's mouth during a convulsion.  These objects can obstruct the child's airway and make breathing difficult.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n*Seek immediate medical attention if this is the child's first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever.  This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of stiff neck, extreme lethargy, or abundant vomiting, which may be signs of meningitis, an infection over the brain surface.<ref name=\"NIH2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Febrile-Seizures-Fact-Sheet|title=Febrile Seizures Fact Sheet.

An influential figure in [[popular music]] and culture for seven decades, Richard's most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his dynamic music and charismatic showmanship laid the foundation for [[rock and roll]].<ref>https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/06/19/little-richard-cece-winans-honored-nashville/28999825/</ref><ref>https://www.phillytrib.com/entertainment/entertainment_now/abn-today-live---interview-with-little-richard-tl/youtube_f03abf7e-be98-51e7-bc91-7883d3e87a0f.html</ref> Characterized by his frenetic piano playing and raspy singing voice, Richard's music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. He influenced numerous singers and musicians across musical genres from [[Rock music|rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; his music helped shape [[rhythm and blues]] for generations to come, and his performances and headline-making thrust his career right into the mix of [[American popular music]].\n\n\"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" (1955), one of Richard's [[signature song]]s, became an instant hit, reaching No. 2 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers]] chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom. It reached No. 21 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]] and No. 29 on the UK singles chart.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Richard's next hit single, \"[[Long Tall Sally]]\" (1956), hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart and No. 13 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100 while reaching the top ten in the UK. Following his success, Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford \"Gene\" Burks and leader [[Grady Gaines]], [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Olsie \"Baysee\" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel \"Buster\" Douglas.{{sfn|White|2003|p=58}} Richard's critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Here's Little Richard]]'' (1957) peaked at No. 13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart.<ref name=\"entertainment.time.com\" />\n\nIn 1962, concert promoter [[Don Arden]] persuaded Little Richard to tour Europe after telling him his records were still selling well there even though they were not in the US.{{sfn|White|2003|p=112}} Having heard of Richard's European tour, [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[The Beatles]], asked Arden to allow the band to open for Richard on some tour dates, to which he agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom that October.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=12}} During this time, Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught [[Paul McCartney]] his distinctive [[vocal music|vocalizations]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} In the fall of 1963, Richard agreed to rescue a sagging tour featuring [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. At the end of that tour, Richard was given his own TV special for [[Granada Television]] titled ''The Little Richard Spectacular''.{{sfn|White|2003|p=121}}\n\nRichard has been honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[The Recording Academy|Recording Academy]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]. In 2015, Richard received a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award from the [[National Museum of African American Music]] for his key role in the formation of popular music genres and helping to bring an end to the racial divide on the music charts and in concert in the mid-1950s changing American culture significantly. \"Tutti Frutti\" was included in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2010, which stated that his \"unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music\".\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Wayne Penniman was born in [[Macon, Georgia]], on December 5, 1932,<ref name=\"bare\">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues - A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger Publishers| location= Santa Barbara| pages=275 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}</ref> the third of 12 children of Leva Mae (n\u00e9e Stewart) and Charles \"Bud\" Penniman.

A mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors, Penniman began singing in church at a young age.{{sfn|Otfinoski|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|White|2003|p=7}} Possibly as a result of complications at birth, he had a slight [[deformity]] that left one of his legs shorter than the other. This produced an unusual gait, and he was mocked for his allegedly [[effeminate]] appearance.{{sfn|White|2003|p=6}}\n\nPenniman's family was very religious and joined various [[A.M.E.]], [[Baptist]], and [[Pentecostal]] churches, with some family members becoming ministers. He enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of their charismatic worship and live music.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16\u201317}} He later recalled that people in his neighborhood sang gospel songs throughout the day during [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] to keep a positive outlook, because \"there was so much poverty, so much prejudice in those days\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=7\u20139}} He had observed that people sang \"to feel their connection with God\" and to wash their trials and burdens away.{{sfn|White|2003|p=8}} Gifted with a loud singing voice, Penniman recalled that he was \"always changing the key upwards\" and that they once stopped him from singing in church for \"screaming and hollering\" so loud, earning him the nickname \"War Hawk\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}} As a child, he would \"beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever\" while singing, which annoyed neighbors.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}}\n\nPenniman's initial musical influences were gospel performers such as [[Brother Joe May]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], and [[Marion Williams]]. May, a singing evangelist who was known as \"the Thunderbolt of the Middle West\" because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired Penniman to become a preacher.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Ryan|2004|p=77}} Penniman attended Macon's [[Ballard-Hudson High School|Hudson High School]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seibert|first1=David|title=Ballard-Hudson Senior High School|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bibb/ballard-hudson-senior-high-school|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}</ref> where he was a below-average student. He eventually learned to play [[alto saxophone]], joining his school's marching band while in fifth grade.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}} While in high school, he obtained a part-time job at [[Macon City Auditorium]] for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint Brantley. He sold [[Coca-Cola]] to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Lucky Millinder]], and his favorite singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=17}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Beginnings (1947\u20131955)===\nIn October 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe overheard 14-year-old  Penniman singing her songs before a performance at the [[Macon City Auditorium]].

Penniman was inspired to wear turbans and capes in his career by Nubillo, who also \"carried a black stick and exhibited something he called 'the devil's child' - the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head.\" Nubillo told Penniman he was \"gonna be famous\" but that he would have to \"go where the grass is greener.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nBefore entering the tenth grade, Penniman left his family home and joined Dr. Hudson's Medicine Show in 1949, performing [[Louis Jordan]]'s \"[[Caldonia]]\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21\u201322}} Penniman recalled the song was the first secular R&B song he learned, since his family had strict rules against playing R&B music, which they considered \"devil music.\"{{sfn|White|2003|p=22: \"It was the only song I knew that wasn't a church song\"}} Penniman also performed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] during this time, performing under the name \"Princess LaVonne\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22\u201325}} In 1950, Penniman joined his first musical band, Buster Brown's Orchestra, where Brown gave him the name Little Richard.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22\u201323}} Performing in the [[minstrel show]] circuit, Penniman, in and out of drag, performed for various vaudeville acts such as Sugarfoot Sam from Alabam, the Tidy Jolly Steppers, the King Brothers Circus and Broadway Follies.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=24\u201325}} Having settled in Atlanta, Georgia at this point, Penniman began listening to rhythm and blues and frequented Atlanta clubs, including the Harlem Theater and the Royal Peacock where he saw performers such as [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] and [[Billy Wright (musician)|Billy Wright]] onstage. Penniman was further influenced by Brown's and Wright's flashy style of showmanship and was even more influenced by Wright's flamboyant persona and showmanship. Inspired by Brown and Wright, Penniman decided to become a rhythm and blues singer and after befriending Wright, began to learn how to be an entertainer from him, and began adapting a pompadour hairdo similar to Wright's, as well as styling a [[pencil moustache|pencil mustache]], using Wright's brand of facial pancake makeup and wearing flashier clothes.{{sfn|White|2003|p=25}}\n\nImpressed by his singing voice, Wright put him in contact with Zenas Sears, a local DJ. Sears recorded Penniman at his station, backed by Wright's band. The recordings led to a contract that year with [[RCA Victor]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Penniman recorded a total of eight sides for RCA Victor, including the blues ballad, \"Every Hour,\" which became his first single and a hit in Georgia.{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} The release of \"Every Hour\" improved his relationship with his father, who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox.{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Shortly after the release of \"Every Hour\", Penniman was hired to front Perry Welch and His Orchestra and played at clubs and army bases for $100 a week.{{sfn|White|2003|p=29}} After a year with RCA Victor, Penniman left the label in February 1952 after his records there failed to become national hits.<ref>A few years later, after Penniman began to find success with his recordings, RCA put the sides back into circulation via its [[RCA Camden]] subsidiary.</ref> That same month, Penniman's father Bud was killed after a confrontation outside his club. Penniman continued to perform during this time and Clint Brantley agreed to manage Penniman's career. Moving to Houston, he formed a band called the Tempo Toppers, performing as part of blues [[package tour]]s in Southern clubs such as Club Tijuana in New Orleans and Club Matinee in Houston. Penniman signed with [[Don Robey]]'s [[Peacock Records]] in February 1953, recording eight sides, including four with [[Johnny Otis]] and his band that were unreleased at the time.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=36\u201338}} Like his venture with RCA Victor, none of Penniman's Peacock singles charted despite Penniman's growing reputation for his high energy antics onstage.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|title=Little Richard (American musician)|author=Langdon C.

Disillusioned by the record business, Penniman returned to Macon in 1954 and, struggling with poverty, settled for work as a dishwasher for [[Southeastern Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Lines]]. That year, he disbanded the Tempo Toppers and formed a harder-driving rhythm and blues band, the Upsetters, which included drummer [[Charles Connor]] and saxophonist Wilbert \"Lee Diamond\" Smith and toured under Brantley's management.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=38\u201339}}<ref name=Allmusic2013a>{{cite web|website=Allmusic|title=Grady Gaines|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p78484/biography|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Jonny Whiteside, [http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2014/05/14/charles-connor-the-rock-and-roll-original \"Charles Connor: The Rock and Roll Original\"], LA Weekly, May 14, 2014.</ref> The band supported R&B singer Christine Kittrell on some recordings, then began to tour successfully, even without a bass guitarist, forcing drummer Connor to thump \"real hard\" on his bass drum in order to get a \"[[bass fiddle]] effect.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=38\u201339}} Around this time, Penniman signed a contract to tour with fellow R&B singer [[Little Johnny Taylor]].\n\nAt the suggestion of [[Lloyd Price]], Penniman sent a demo to Price's label, [[Specialty Records]], in February 1955. Months passed before Penniman got a call from the label.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=40\u201341}} Finally, in September of that year, Specialty owner [[Art Rupe]] loaned Penniman money to buy out of his Peacock contract and set him to work with producer [[Robert Blackwell|Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell]].{{sfn|Nite|1982|p=390}} Upon hearing Penniman's demo, Blackwell felt Penniman was Specialty's answer to [[Ray Charles]], however, Penniman told him he preferred the sound of [[Fats Domino]]. Blackwell sent him to [[New Orleans]] where he recorded at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studios, recording there with several of Domino's session musicians, including drummer [[Earl Palmer]] and saxophonist [[Lee Allen (musician)|Lee Allen]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=44\u201347}} Initially, Penniman's recordings that month failed to produce much inspiration or interest. Frustrated, Blackwell and Penniman went to relax at the Dew Drop Inn nightclub. According to Blackwell, Penniman then launched into a risqu\u00e9 [[dirty blues]] he titled \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\". Blackwell said he felt the song had hit potential and hired songwriter [[Dorothy LaBostrie]] to replace some of Little Richard's sexual lyrics with less controversial words.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=55\u201356}}<ref name=Allmusic2013b>{{cite web|website=Allmusic|title=Little Richard|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4765|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> Recorded in three takes in September 1955, \"Tutti Frutti\" was released as a single that November.{{sfn|White|2003|p=264}}\n\n===Initial success and conversion (1955\u20131962)===\n{{quote box|width=20%|quote=A lot of songs I sang to crowds first to watch their reaction.

Like \"Tutti Frutti\", it sold over a million copies. Following his success, Little Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford \"Gene\" Burks and [[bandleader|leader]] [[Grady Gaines]], [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Olsie \"Baysee\" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel \"Buster\" Douglas.{{sfn|White|2003|p=58}} Penniman began performing on package tours across the United States. Art Rupe described the differences between Penniman and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that, while \"the similarities between Little Richard and Fats Domino for recording purposes were close\", Penniman would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording and that onstage, where Domino was \"plodding, very slow\", Penniman was \"very dynamic, completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nPenniman's performances, like most early rock and roll shows, resulted in [[Racial integration|integrated]] audience reaction during an era where public places were divided into \"white\" and \"colored\" domains. In these package tours, Penniman and other artists such as Fats Domino and [[Chuck Berry]] would enable audiences of both races to enter the building, albeit still segregated (e.g. blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor). As his bandleader at the time, [[H.B. Barnum]], explained, Penniman's performances enabled audiences to come together to dance.{{sfn|Pegg|2002|p=50: \"Although they still had the audiences together in the building, they were ''there'' together. And most times, before the end of the night, they would be all mixed together\"}} Despite broadcasts on TV from local [[racism|supremacist]] groups such as the North Alabama [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Council]] warning that rock and roll \"brings the races together,\" Penniman's popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at \"white-only venues,\" especially in the South where racism was most overt.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=82\u201383}} Penniman's high-energy antics included lifting his leg while playing the piano, climbing on top of his piano, running on and off the stage and throwing his souvenirs to the audience.{{sfn|Bayles|1996|p=133: \"He'd be on the stage, he'd be off the stage, he'd be jumping and yelling, screaming, whipping the audience on&nbsp;...\"}} Penniman also began using capes and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins. Penniman said he began to be more flamboyant onstage so no one would think he was \"after the white girls\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=70}}\n\nPenniman claims that a show at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Theatre (Baltimore)|Royal Theatre]] in June 1956 led to women throwing their [[undergarments]] onstage at him, resulting in other female fans repeating the action, saying it was \"the first time\" that had happened to any artist.{{sfn|White|2003|p=66}} Penniman's show would stop several times that night due to fans being restrained from jumping off the balcony and then rushing to the stage to touch Penniman. Overall, Penniman would produce seven singles in the United States alone in 1956, with five of them also charting in the UK, including \"[[Slippin' and Slidin']]\", \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\", \"[[Ready Teddy]]\", \"[[The Girl Can't Help It (song)|The Girl Can't Help It]]\" and \"[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]\". Immediately after releasing \"Tutti Frutti\", which was then protocol for the industry, \"safer\" white recording artists such as [[Pat Boone]] re-recorded the song, sending the song to the top twenty of the charts, several positions higher than Penniman's. At the same time, fellow rock and roll peers such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] also recorded Penniman's songs later in the year. Befriending [[Alan Freed]], Freed eventually put him in his \"rock and roll\" movies such as ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' and ''[[Mister Rock and Roll (film)|Mister Rock and Roll]]''.

During his tenure at Specialty, despite earning millions for the label, Penniman complained that he did not know the label had cut the percentage of royalties he was to earn for his recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=88\u201389}} Specialty continued to release Penniman recordings, including \"[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]\" and his version of \u201cKansas City\u201d, until 1960. Finally ending his contract with the label, Penniman agreed to relinquish any [[royalties]] for his material.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=95\u201397}} In 1958, Penniman formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=94\u201395}} A month after his conversion, Penniman met Ernestine Harvin, a secretary from Washington, D.C., and the couple married on July 11, 1959.{{sfn|White|2003|p=97}} Penniman ventured into gospel music, first recording for [[End Records]], before signing with [[Mercury Records]] in 1961, where he eventually released ''King of the Gospel Singers'', in 1962, produced by [[Quincy Jones]], who later remarked that Penniman's vocals impressed him more than any other vocalist he had worked with.{{sfn|White|2003|p=102: \"Richard had such a unique voice and style that no one has ever matched it \u2013 even to this day\"}} His childhood heroine, [[Mahalia Jackson]], wrote in the liner notes of the album that Penniman \"sang gospel the way it should be sung\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=103: \"He sang gospel the way it should be sung.

With fellow rock singer [[Sam Cooke]] as an opening act, Penniman, who featured a teenage [[Billy Preston]] in his gospel band, figured it was a gospel tour and, after Cooke's delayed arrival forced him to cancel his show on the opening date, performed only gospel material on the show, leading to boos from the audience expecting Penniman to sing his rock and roll hits. The following night, Penniman viewed Cooke's well received performance. Bringing back his competitive drive, Penniman and Preston warmed up in darkness before launching into \"Long Tall Sally\", resulting in frenetic, hysterical responses from the audience. A show at [[Mansfield]]'s Granada Theatre ended early after fans rushed the stage.{{sfn|White|2003|p=112}} Hearing of Penniman's shows, [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[The Beatles]], asked Don Arden to allow his band to open for Penniman on some tour dates, to which he agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom that October.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=12}} The following month they, along with Swedish singer [[Jerry Williams (singer)|Jerry Williams]] and his band The Violents,<ref name=\"liret\">{{cite news|last1=Steen|first1=H\u00e5kan|title=H\u00e5kan Steen: Tack s\u00e5 mycket f\u00f6r liret \"Jerka\"|trans-title=H\u00e5kan Steen: Thanks so much for the jive \"Jenka\"|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/Kvq3L6/hakan-steen-tack-sa-mycket-for-liret-jerka|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=26 March 2018}}</ref> opened for Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} During this time, Little Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught [[Paul McCartney]] his distinctive [[vocal music|vocalizations]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} Back in the US, Little Richard recorded six rock and roll songs with the Upsetters for [[Little Star Records]], under the name \"World Famous Upsetters\", hoping this would keep his options open in maintaining his position as a minister.\n\nIn the fall of 1963, Penniman was called by a concert promoter to rescue a sagging tour featuring [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. Penniman agreed and helped to save the tour from flopping. At the end of that tour, Penniman was given his own TV special for [[Granada Television]] titled ''The Little Richard Spectacular''. The special became a ratings hit and after 60,000 fan letters, was rebroadcast twice.{{sfn|White|2003|p=121}} In 1964, now openly re-embracing rock and roll again, Penniman released \"Bama Lama Bama Loo\" on Specialty Records. Due to his UK exposure, the song reached the top twenty there but only climbed to number 82 in his native country.{{sfn|White|2003|p=248}} Later in the year, he signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]], then on its dying legs, to release his \"comeback\" album, ''[[Little Richard Is Back (And There's a Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On!)|Little Richard Is Back]]''. Due to the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands as well as the rise of soul labels such as [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records]] and the popularity of [[James Brown]], Penniman's new releases were not well promoted or well received by radio stations . In November, 1964, [[Jimi Hendrix]] joined Penniman's Upsetters band as a full member.{{sfn|McDermott|2009|p=13}}<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Havers |first2=Richard |last2=Evans |title=The Golden Age of Rock 'N' Roll |publisher=Chartwell Books |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZSeU_rmdxYC&pg=PA126 |page=126 |isbn=978-0785826255}}</ref> In the Spring of 1965, Penniman took Hendrix and Billy Preston to a New York studio where they recorded the [[Don Covay]] soul ballad, \"I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)\", which became a number 12 R&B hit.<ref>{{harvnb|McDermott|2009|p=12}}: Hendrix recording with Little Richard; {{harvnb|Shadwick|2003|pp=56\u201357}}: \"I Don't Know What You Got (But It's Got Me)\" recorded in New York City.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Three other songs were recorded during the sessions, \"Dance A Go Go\" aka \"Dancin' All Around The World\", \"You Better Stop\", and \"Come See About Me\" (possibly an instrumental), but \u201cYou Better Stop\u201d was not issued until 1971 and \u201cCome See About Me\u201d , has yet to see the light of day.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=57}}}}\n\nHendrix and Penniman clashed over the spotlight, Hendrix's tardiness, wardrobe and Hendrix's stage antics. Hendrix also complained over not being properly paid by Penniman. In July 1965, Richard's Brother Charles fired Jimi [This is possibly incorrect. Jimi wrote to his father, Al Hendrix, that he quit Little Richard over money problems - he was owed 1,000 dollars.] Hendrix then rejoined [[The Isley Brothers]]' band, the IB Specials.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|pp=56\u201360}} Penniman later signed with [[Modern Records]], releasing a modest charter, \"Do You Feel It?\" before leaving for [[Okeh Records]] in early 1966. Two poorly produced albums were released over time, first a live album, cut at the Domino, in Atlanta, Georgia. Okeh paired Penniman with his old friend, [[Larry Williams]], who produced two albums on Penniman, including the studio release, ''[[The Explosive Little Richard]]'', which produced the modest charters \"Poor Dog\" and \"Commandments of Love\". His second Okeh album, ''Little Richard's Greatest Hits Recorded Live!'', returned him to the album charts.<ref name=\"HallofFame1986\">{{cite web|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|year=1986|title=Little Richard|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/little-richard/|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|White|2003|pp=253\u2013255}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=268\u2013269}} In 1967, Penniman signed with [[Brunswick Records]] but after clashing with the label over musical direction, he left the label that same year.\n\n[[File:Little Richard (1967).png|thumb|left|180px|Little Richard in 1967]]\n\nPenniman felt that producers on his labels worked in not promoting his records during this period. Later, he claimed they kept trying to push him to records similar to Motown and felt he wasn't treated with appropriate respect.<ref>\"Religion and Rock and Roll\", ''Joel Martin Show'', WBAB 102.3 FM, NY. Guests: [[Harry Hepcat]] and Little Richard, August 16, 1981.</ref> Little Richard often performed in dingy clubs and lounges with little support from his label. While Penniman managed to perform in huge venues overseas such as England and France, Penniman was forced to perform in the [[Chitlin' Circuit]]. Penniman's flamboyant look, while a hit during the 1950s, failed to help his labels to promote him to more conservative black record buyers.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=41}} Penniman later claimed that his decision to \"[[backslide]]\" from his ministry, led religious clergymen to protest his new recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|p=132}} Making matters worse, Penniman said, was his insistence on performing in front of integrated audiences at the time of the black liberation movement shortly after the [[Watts riots]] and the formation of the [[Black Panthers]] prevented many black radio disk jockeys in certain areas of the country, including Los Angeles, to play his music.{{sfn|White|2003|p=133}} Now acting as his manager, Larry Williams convinced Penniman to focus on his live shows. By 1968, he had ditched the Upsetters for his new backup band, the Crown Jewels, performing on the Canadian TV show, \"Where It's At\". Penniman was also featured on the [[Monkees]] TV special ''[[33\u2153 Revolutions per Monkee]]'' in April 1969. Williams booked Penniman shows in [[Las Vegas]] casinos and resorts, leading Penniman to adapt a wilder flamboyant and androgynous look, inspired by the success of his former backing guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Penniman was soon booked at rock festivals such as the [[Atlantic City Pop Festival]] where he stole the show from headliner [[Janis Joplin]]. Penniman produced a similar show stealer at the Toronto Pop Festival with [[John Lennon]] as the headliner. These successes brought Little Richard to talk shows such as the ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and the ''[[Dick Cavett Show]]'', making him a major celebrity again.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nResponding to his reputation as a successful concert performer, [[Reprise Records]] signed Penniman in 1970 where he released the album, ''[[The Rill Thing]]'', with the philosophical single, \"Freedom Blues\", becoming his biggest charted single in years. In May 1970, Penniman made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Despite the success of \"Freedom Blues\", none of Penniman's other Reprise singles charted with the exception of \"Greenwood, Mississippi\", a swamp rock original by guitar hero, Travis Wammack, who incidentally played on the track. It charted only briefly on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and Cash Box pop chart, also on the Billboard Country charts; made a strong showing on WWRL in New York, before disappearing. Penniman became a featured guest instrumentalist and vocalist on recordings by acts such as [[Delaney and Bonnie]], [[Joey Covington]] and [[Joe Walsh]] and was prominently featured on [[Canned Heat]]'s 1972 hit single, \"Rockin' with the King\". To keep up with his finances and bookings, Penniman and three of his brothers formed a management company, Bud Hole Incorporated.{{sfn|White|2003|p=168}} By 1972, Penniman had entered the rock and roll revival circuit, and that year, he co-headlined the [[London Rock and Roll Show]] at Wembley Stadium with fellow peer [[Chuck Berry]] where he'd come onstage and announce himself \"the king of rock and roll\", fittingly also the title of his 1971 album with Reprise and told the packed audience there to \"let it all hang out\"; Penniman however was booed during the show when he climbed on top of his piano and stopped singing; he also seemed to ignore much of the crowd. To make matters worse, he showed up with just five musicians, and struggled through low lighting and bad microphones. When the concert film documenting the show came out, his performance was considered generally strong, though his fans noticed a drop in energy and vocal artistry. Two songs he performed did not make the final cut of the film. The following year, he recorded a charting \nsoul ballad, \"In the Middle of the Night\", released with proceeds donated to victims of [[tornadoes]] that had caused damage in 12 states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|title=New York Beat|date=July 5, 1973|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|volume=44|number=15|page=62}}</ref> In 1976, Penniman re-recorded eighteen of his classic rock and roll hits in Nashville for [[K-Tel Records]], in high tech stereo recreations, with a single featuring live versions of \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" and \"Rip It Up\" reaching the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name=\"betts\">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952\u20132004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 978-0-00-717931-2| page=457}}</ref> Penniman's performances began to take a toll by 1973, however, suffering from voice problems and quirky marathon renditions.

According to Robinson, Penniman would use her to buy food in white-only fast food stores as he could not enter any due to the color of his skin.\n\nPenniman met his only wife, Ernestine Harvin, at an evangelical rally in October 1957. They began dating that year and wed on July 12, 1959, in California. According to Harvin, she and Little Richard initially enjoyed a happy marriage with \"normal\" sexual relations. Harvin claimed when the marriage ended in divorce in 1964, it was due to her husband's celebrity status, noting that it had made life difficult for her. Penniman would claim the marriage fell apart due to his being a neglectful husband and his sexuality.{{sfn|White|2003|p=105}} Both Robinson and Harvin denied Penniman's claims that he was gay and Penniman believed they did not know it because he was \"such a [[masturbation|pumper]] in those days\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=105}} During the marriage, Penniman and Harvin adopted a one-year-old boy, Danny Jones, from a late church associate.{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} Little Richard and his son remain close, with Jones often acting as one of his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Merchant|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/rutherford/2014/08/28/little-richard-murfreesboro-accident/14738937/|title=Little Richard's Cadillac struck in Murfreesboro crash|work=The Tennessean|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=2019-09-05}}</ref> Ernestine later married Mcdonald Campbell in Santa Barbara, California, on March 23, 1975.\n\n===Sexuality===\nPenniman said in 1984 that he played with just girls as a child and was subjected to [[homophobia|homophobic]] jokes and ridicule because of his manner of walk and talk.{{sfn|White|2003|p=9}} His father [[corporal punishment|brutally punished]] him whenever he caught him wearing his mother's makeup and clothing.{{sfn|Jet|2000|p=64}} The singer claimed to have been sexually involved with both sexes as a teenager.{{sfn|White|2003|p=10}} Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15.{{sfn|White|2003|p=21}} In 1985, on ''The South Bank Show'', Penniman explained, \"my daddy put me out of the house.

It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\"{{sfn|Jet|1984|p=60}} In 2000, Richard told ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine, \"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\"{{sfn|Jet|2000|p=65}}  Penniman's look, however, still attracted female audiences, who would send him naked photos and their phone numbers.{{sfn| White| 2003|p=70-71}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=36}} Groupies began throwing undergarments at Penniman during performances.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring Penniman's heyday, his obsession with voyeurism carried on with his girlfriend Audrey Robinson.

After re-embracing rock and roll in the mid-1960s, he began participating in orgies and continued to be a voyeur. In his 1984 book, while demeaning homosexuality as \"unnatural\" and \"contagious\", he told Charles White he was \"[[omnisexual]]\".{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} In 1995, Little Richard told ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' that he always knew he was gay, saying \"I've been gay all my life\".{{sfn|Chalmers|2012}} In 2007, ''Mojo Magazine'' referred to Little Richard as \"[[bisexual]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/tutti-frutti-tops-world-changing-hit-list-310948.html#!|title=Tutti Frutti tops world-changing hit list|date=May 16, 2007|website=Breakingnews.ie|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In October 2017, Penniman once again denounced homosexuality in an interview with Three Angels Broadcasting Network, calling homosexual and [[transgender]] identity \"unnatural affection\" that goes against \"the way God wants you to live\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Trudy|last=Ring|url=https://www.advocate.com/people/2017/10/06/little-richard-once-gay-now-antigay-again|title=Little Richard, Once Gay, Is Now Antigay \u2014 Again|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=[[Here Media]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=October 6, 2017|accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Drug use===\nDuring his initial heyday in the 1950s rock and roll scene, Penniman was a [[teetotalism|teetotaler]] abstaining from alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.

By the mid-1960s, however, Penniman began drinking heavy amounts of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and smoking [[cigarette]]s and [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dTr_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT183&dq=little+richard+marijuana#v=onepage&q=little%20richard%20marijuana&f=false|title=The Life and Times of Little Richard|isbn=9781783230143|last1=White|first1=Charles|date=2003-06-14}}</ref> By 1972, he had developed an addiction to [[cocaine]].

Penniman later mentioned that this was the most fearful moment of his life because Williams's own drug addiction made him wildly unpredictable. Penniman did, however, also acknowledge that he and Williams were \"very close friends\" and when reminiscing of the drug-fueled clash, he recalled thinking \"I knew he loved me \u2013 I hoped he did!\"{{sfn|White|2003|p=186}} Within that same year, Penniman had several devastating personal experiences, including his brother Tony's death of a heart attack, the accidental shooting of his nephew that he loved like a son, and the murder of two close personal friends \u2013 one a valet at \"the heroin man's house.\"{{sfn|White|2003|p=188}} The combination of these experiences convinced the singer to give up drugs including alcohol, along with rock and roll, and return to the ministry.{{sfn|Sarasota Herald-Tribune|1979|p=13}}\n\n===Religion===\nPenniman's family had deep evangelical ([[Baptist]] and [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME)) Christian roots, including two uncles and a grandfather who were preachers.{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}} He also took part in Macon's [[Pentecostal]] churches, which were his favorites mainly due to their music, charismatic praise, dancing in the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] and [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16\u201317}} At age 10, influenced by Pentecostalism, Little Richard would go around saying he was a [[Faith healing|faith healer]], singing gospel music to people who were feeling sick and touching them. He later recalled that they would often indicate that they felt better after he prayed for them and would sometimes give him money.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16\u201317}} Little Richard had aspirations of being a preacher due to the influence of singing evangelist Brother Joe May.{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}}\n\nAfter he was [[born again]] in 1957, Penniman enrolled at [[Oakwood University|Oakwood College]] in Huntsville, Alabama, a mostly black [[Seventh-day Adventist]] college, to study theology.

Penniman represented Memorial Bibles International and sold their Black Heritage Bible, which highlighted the Book's many black characters. As a preacher, he evangelized in small churches and packed auditoriums of 20,000 or more. His preaching focused on uniting the races and bringing lost souls to repentance through God's love.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=203\u2013214}} In 1984, Penniman's mother, Leva Mae, died following a period of illness.

An influential figure in [[popular music]] and culture for seven decades, Richard's most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his dynamic music and charismatic showmanship laid the foundation for [[rock and roll]].<ref>https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/06/19/little-richard-cece-winans-honored-nashville/28999825/</ref><ref>https://www.phillytrib.com/entertainment/entertainment_now/abn-today-live---interview-with-little-richard-tl/youtube_f03abf7e-be98-51e7-bc91-7883d3e87a0f.html</ref> Characterized by his frenetic piano playing and raspy singing voice, Richard's music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. He influenced numerous singers and musicians across musical genres from [[Rock music|rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; his music helped shape [[rhythm and blues]] for generations to come, and his performances and headline-making thrust his career right into the mix of [[American popular music]]. \n\n\"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" (1955), one of Richard's [[Signature song|signature songs]], became an instant hit, reaching No. 2 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers]] chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom. It reached No. 21 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]] and No. 29 on the UK singles chart.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Richard's next hit single, \"[[Long Tall Sally]]\" (1956), hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart and No. 13 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100 while reaching the top ten in the UK. Following his success, Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford \"Gene\" Burks and leader [[Grady Gaines]], [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Olsie \"Baysee\" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel \"Buster\" Douglas.{{sfn|White|2003|p=58}} Richard's critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Here's Little Richard]]'' (1957) peaked at No. 13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart.<ref name=\"entertainment.time.com\" />\n\nIn 1962, concert promoter [[Don Arden]] persuaded Little Richard to tour Europe after telling him his records were still selling well there even though they were not in the US.{{sfn|White|2003|p=112}} Having heard of Richard's European tour, [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[The Beatles]], asked Arden to allow the band to open for Richard on some tour dates, to which he agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom that October.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=12}} During this time, Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught [[Paul McCartney]] his distinctive [[vocal music|vocalizations]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=600}} In the fall of 1963, Richard agreed to rescue a sagging tour featuring [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. At the end of that tour, Richard was given his own TV special for [[Granada Television]] titled ''The Little Richard Spectacular''.{{sfn|White|2003|p=121}}  \n\nRichard has been honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[The Recording Academy|Recording Academy]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]. In 2015, Richard received a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award from the [[National Museum of African American Music]] for his key role in the formation of popular music genres and helping to bring an end to the racial divide on the music charts and in concert in the mid-1950s changing American culture significantly. \"Tutti Frutti\" was included in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2010, which stated that his \"unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music\".\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Wayne Penniman was born in [[Macon, Georgia]], on December 5, 1932,<ref name=\"bare\">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues - A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger Publishers| location= Santa Barbara| pages=275 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}</ref> the third of 12 children of Leva Mae (n\u00e9e Stewart) and Charles \"Bud\" Penniman. His father was a church [[deacon]] who sold [[rum-running|bootlegged]] [[moonshine]] on the side and owned a nightclub called the Tip In Inn.{{sfn| Kirby|2009|p=30}}{{sfn|White|2003|p=21}} His mother was a member of Macon's New Hope Baptist Church.{{sfn| White| 2003|p=3}} Initially, his first name was supposed to have been \"Ricardo\", but an error resulted in \"Richard\" instead.{{sfn|Kirby|2009|p=30}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=4\u20135}} The Penniman children were raised in a neighborhood of Macon called Pleasant Hill.{{sfn|White|2003|p=3}} In childhood, he was nicknamed \"Lil' Richard\" by his family because of his small and skinny frame. A mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors, Penniman began singing in church at a young age.{{sfn|Otfinoski|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|White|2003|p=7}} Possibly as a result of complications at birth, he had a slight [[deformity]] that left one of his legs shorter than the other. This produced an unusual gait, and he was mocked for his allegedly [[effeminate]] appearance.{{sfn|White|2003|p=6}}\n\nPenniman's family was very religious and joined various [[A.M.E.]], [[Baptist]], and [[Pentecostal]] churches, with some family members becoming ministers. He enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of their charismatic worship and live music.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=16\u201317}} He later recalled that people in his neighborhood sang gospel songs throughout the day during [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] to keep a positive outlook, because \"there was so much poverty, so much prejudice in those days\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=7\u20139}} He had observed that people sang \"to feel their connection with God\" and to wash their trials and burdens away.{{sfn|White|2003|p=8}} Gifted with a loud singing voice, Penniman recalled that he was \"always changing the key upwards\" and that they once stopped him from singing in church for \"screaming and hollering\" so loud, earning him the nickname \"War Hawk\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=16}} As a child, he would \"beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever\" while singing, which annoyed neighbors.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}}\n\nPenniman's initial musical influences were gospel performers such as [[Brother Joe May]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], and [[Marion Williams]]. May, a singing evangelist who was known as \"the Thunderbolt of the Middle West\" because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired Penniman to become a preacher.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Ryan|2004|p=77}} Penniman attended Macon's [[Ballard-Hudson High School|Hudson High School]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seibert|first1=David|title=Ballard-Hudson Senior High School|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bibb/ballard-hudson-senior-high-school|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}</ref> where he was a below-average student. He eventually learned to play [[alto saxophone]], joining his school's marching band while in fifth grade.{{sfn|White|2003|p=18}} While in high school, he obtained a part-time job at [[Macon City Auditorium]] for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint Brantley. He sold [[Coca-Cola]] to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Lucky Millinder]], and his favorite singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=17}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Beginnings (1947\u20131955)===\nIn October 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe overheard 14-year-old  Penniman singing her songs before a performance at the [[Macon City Auditorium]].

Penniman was inspired to wear turbans and capes in his career by Nubillo, who also \"carried a black stick and exhibited something he called 'the devil's child' - the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head.\" Nubillo told Penniman he was \"gonna be famous\" but that he would have to \"go where the grass is greener.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nBefore entering the tenth grade, Penniman left his family home and joined Dr. Hudson's Medicine Show in 1949, performing [[Louis Jordan]]'s \"[[Caldonia]]\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=21\u201322}} Penniman recalled the song was the first secular R&B song he learned, since his family had strict rules against playing R&B music, which they considered \"devil music.\"{{sfn|White|2003|p=22: \"It was the only song I knew that wasn't a church song\"}} Penniman also performed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] during this time, performing under the name \"Princess LaVonne\".{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22\u201325}} In 1950, Penniman joined his first musical band, Buster Brown's Orchestra, where Brown gave him the name Little Richard.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=22\u201323}} Performing in the [[minstrel show]] circuit, Penniman, in and out of drag, performed for various vaudeville acts such as Sugarfoot Sam from Alabam, the Tidy Jolly Steppers, the King Brothers Circus and Broadway Follies.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=24\u201325}} Having settled in Atlanta, Georgia at this point, Penniman began listening to rhythm and blues and frequented Atlanta clubs, including the Harlem Theater and the Royal Peacock where he saw performers such as [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] and [[Billy Wright (musician)|Billy Wright]] onstage. Penniman was further influenced by Brown's and Wright's flashy style of showmanship and was even more influenced by Wright's flamboyant persona and showmanship. Inspired by Brown and Wright, Penniman decided to become a rhythm and blues singer and after befriending Wright, began to learn how to be an entertainer from him, and began adapting a pompadour hairdo similar to Wright's, as well as styling a [[pencil moustache|pencil mustache]], using Wright's brand of facial pancake makeup and wearing flashier clothes.{{sfn|White|2003|p=25}}\n\nImpressed by his singing voice, Wright put him in contact with Zenas Sears, a local DJ. Sears recorded Penniman at his station, backed by Wright's band. The recordings led to a contract that year with [[RCA Victor]].{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Penniman recorded a total of eight sides for RCA Victor, including the blues ballad, \"Every Hour,\" which became his first single and a hit in Georgia.{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} The release of \"Every Hour\" improved his relationship with his father, who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox.{{sfn|White|2003|p=28}} Shortly after the release of \"Every Hour\", Penniman was hired to front Perry Welch and His Orchestra and played at clubs and army bases for $100 a week.{{sfn|White|2003|p=29}} After a year with RCA Victor, Penniman left the label in February 1952 after his records there failed to become national hits.<ref>A few years later, after Penniman began to find success with his recordings, RCA put the sides back into circulation via its [[RCA Camden]] subsidiary.</ref> That same month, Penniman's father Bud was killed after a confrontation outside his club. Penniman continued to perform during this time and Clint Brantley agreed to manage Penniman's career. Moving to Houston, he formed a band called the Tempo Toppers, performing as part of blues [[package tour]]s in Southern clubs such as Club Tijuana in New Orleans and Club Matinee in Houston. Penniman signed with [[Don Robey]]'s [[Peacock Records]] in February 1953, recording eight sides, including four with [[Johnny Otis]] and his band that were unreleased at the time.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=36\u201338}} Like his venture with RCA Victor, none of Penniman's Peacock singles charted despite Penniman's growing reputation for his high energy antics onstage.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|title=Little Richard (American musician)|author=Langdon C.

Disillusioned by the record business, Penniman returned to Macon in 1954 and, struggling with poverty, settled for work as a dishwasher for [[Southeastern Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Lines]]. That year, he disbanded the Tempo Toppers and formed a harder-driving rhythm and blues band, the Upsetters, which included drummer [[Charles Connor]] and saxophonist Wilbert \"Lee Diamond\" Smith and toured under Brantley's management.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=38\u201339}}<ref name=Allmusic2013a>{{cite web|website=Allmusic|title=Grady Gaines|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p78484/biography|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Jonny Whiteside, [http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2014/05/14/charles-connor-the-rock-and-roll-original \"Charles Connor: The Rock and Roll Original\"], LA Weekly, May 14, 2014.</ref> The band supported R&B singer Christine Kittrell on some recordings, then began to tour successfully, even without a bass guitarist, forcing drummer Connor to thump \"real hard\" on his bass drum in order to get a \"[[bass fiddle]] effect.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=38\u201339}} Around this time, Penniman signed a contract to tour with fellow R&B singer [[Little Johnny Taylor]].\n\nAt the suggestion of [[Lloyd Price]], Penniman sent a demo to Price's label, [[Specialty Records]], in February 1955. Months passed before Penniman got a call from the label.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=40\u201341}} Finally, in September of that year, Specialty owner [[Art Rupe]] loaned Penniman money to buy out of his Peacock contract and set him to work with producer [[Robert Blackwell|Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell]].{{sfn|Nite|1982|p=390}} Upon hearing Penniman's demo, Blackwell felt Penniman was Specialty's answer to [[Ray Charles]], however, Penniman told him he preferred the sound of [[Fats Domino]]. Blackwell sent him to [[New Orleans]] where he recorded at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studios, recording there with several of Domino's session musicians, including drummer [[Earl Palmer]] and saxophonist [[Lee Allen (musician)|Lee Allen]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=44\u201347}} Initially, Penniman's recordings that month failed to produce much inspiration or interest. Frustrated, Blackwell and Penniman went to relax at the Dew Drop Inn nightclub. According to Blackwell, Penniman then launched into a risqu\u00e9 [[dirty blues]] he titled \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\".

Like \"Tutti Frutti\", it sold over a million copies. Following his success, Little Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford \"Gene\" Burks and [[bandleader|leader]] [[Grady Gaines]], [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Olsie \"Baysee\" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel \"Buster\" Douglas.{{sfn|White|2003|p=58}} Penniman began performing on package tours across the United States. Art Rupe described the differences between Penniman and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that, while \"the similarities between Little Richard and Fats Domino for recording purposes were close\", Penniman would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording and that onstage, where Domino was \"plodding, very slow\", Penniman was \"very dynamic, completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist.\"{{sfn|White|2003|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nPenniman's performances, like most early rock and roll shows, resulted in [[Racial integration|integrated]] audience reaction during an era where public places were divided into \"white\" and \"colored\" domains. In these package tours, Penniman and other artists such as Fats Domino and [[Chuck Berry]] would enable audiences of both races to enter the building, albeit still segregated (e.g. blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor). As his bandleader at the time, [[H.B. Barnum]], explained, Penniman's performances enabled audiences to come together to dance.{{sfn|Pegg|2002|p=50: \"Although they still had the audiences together in the building, they were ''there'' together. And most times, before the end of the night, they would be all mixed together\"}} Despite broadcasts on TV from local [[racism|supremacist]] groups such as the North Alabama [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Council]] warning that rock and roll \"brings the races together,\" Penniman's popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at \"white-only venues,\" especially in the South where racism was most overt.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=82\u201383}} Penniman's high-energy antics included lifting his leg while playing the piano, climbing on top of his piano, running on and off the stage and throwing his souvenirs to the audience.{{sfn|Bayles|1996|p=133: \"He'd be on the stage, he'd be off the stage, he'd be jumping and yelling, screaming, whipping the audience on&nbsp;...\"}} Penniman also began using capes and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins. Penniman said he began to be more flamboyant onstage so no one would think he was \"after the white girls\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=70}}\n\nPenniman claims that a show at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Theatre (Baltimore)|Royal Theatre]] in June 1956 led to women throwing their [[undergarments]] onstage at him, resulting in other female fans repeating the action, saying it was \"the first time\" that had happened to any artist.{{sfn|White|2003|p=66}} Penniman's show would stop several times that night due to fans being restrained from jumping off the balcony and then rushing to the stage to touch Penniman. Overall, Penniman would produce seven singles in the United States alone in 1956, with five of them also charting in the UK, including \"[[Slippin' and Slidin']]\", \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\", \"[[Ready Teddy]]\", \"[[The Girl Can't Help It (song)|The Girl Can't Help It]]\" and \"[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]\". Immediately after releasing \"Tutti Frutti\", which was then protocol for the industry, \"safer\" white recording artists such as [[Pat Boone]] re-recorded the song, sending the song to the top twenty of the charts, several positions higher than Penniman's. At the same time, fellow rock and roll peers such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] also recorded Penniman's songs later in the year. Befriending [[Alan Freed]], Freed eventually put him in his \"rock and roll\" movies such as ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' and ''[[Mister Rock and Roll (film)|Mister Rock and Roll]]''.

In October 1957, Penniman embarked on a package tour in Australia with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Eddie Cochran]]. During the middle of the tour, he shocked the public by announcing he was following a life in the [[minister (Christianity)|ministry]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=89\u201392}} Penniman would claim in his autobiography that during a flight from Melbourne to Sydney that his plane was experiencing some difficulty and he claimed to have seen the plane's red hot engines and felt angels were \"holding it up\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=91}} At the end of his Sydney performance, Penniman saw a bright red fireball flying across the sky above him and claimed he was \"deeply shaken\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=91}} Though it was eventually told to him that it was the launching of the first [[artificial satellite|artificial Earth satellite]] [[Sputnik 1]], Penniman claimed he took it as a \"sign from God\" to repent from performing secular music and his wild lifestyle at the time.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=89\u201392}}\n\nReturning to the States ten days earlier than expected, Penniman read news of his original flight having crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] as a further sign to \"do as God wanted\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=92}} After a \"farewell performance\" at the [[Apollo Theater]] and a \"final\" recording session with Specialty later that month, Penniman enrolled at [[Oakwood College]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to study theology.{{sfn|White|2003|p=95}}{{sfn|Miller|1996|p=248}} Despite his claims of spiritual rebirth, Penniman admitted his reasons for leaving were more monetary. During his tenure at Specialty, despite earning millions for the label, Penniman complained that he did not know the label had cut the percentage of royalties he was to earn for his recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=88\u201389}} Specialty continued to release Penniman recordings, including \"[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]\" and his version of \u201cKansas City\u201d, until 1960. Finally ending his contract with the label, Penniman agreed to relinquish any [[royalties]] for his material.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=95\u201397}} In 1958, Penniman formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach.{{sfn|White|2003|pp=94\u201395}} A month after his conversion, Penniman met Ernestine Harvin, a secretary from Washington, D.C., and the couple married on July 11, 1959.{{sfn|White|2003|p=97}} Penniman ventured into gospel music, first recording for [[End Records]], before signing with [[Mercury Records]] in 1961, where he eventually released ''King of the Gospel Singers'', in 1962, produced by [[Quincy Jones]], who later remarked that Penniman's vocals impressed him more than any other vocalist he had worked with.{{sfn|White|2003|p=102: \"Richard had such a unique voice and style that no one has ever matched it \u2013 even to this day\"}} His childhood heroine, [[Mahalia Jackson]], wrote in the liner notes of the album that Penniman \"sang gospel the way it should be sung\".{{sfn|White|2003|p=103: \"He sang gospel the way it should be sung.

With fellow rock singer [[Sam Cooke]] as an opening act, Penniman, who featured a teenage [[Billy Preston]] in his gospel band, figured it was a gospel tour and, after Cooke's delayed arrival forced him to cancel his show on the opening date, performed only gospel material on the show, leading to boos from the audience expecting Penniman to sing his rock and roll hits. The following night, Penniman viewed Cooke's well received performance. Bringing back his competitive drive, Penniman and Preston warmed up in darkness before launching into \"Long Tall Sally\", resulting in frenetic, hysterical responses from the audience. A show at [[Mansfield]]'s Granada Theatre ended early after fans rushed the stage.{{sfn|White|2003|p=112}} Hearing of Penniman's shows, [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[The Beatles]], asked Don Arden to allow his band to open for Penniman on some tour dates, to which he agreed.

Penniman agreed and helped to save the tour from flopping. At the end of that tour, Penniman was given his own TV special for [[Granada Television]] titled ''The Little Richard Spectacular''. The special became a ratings hit and after 60,000 fan letters, was rebroadcast twice.{{sfn|White|2003|p=121}} In 1964, now openly re-embracing rock and roll again, Penniman released \"Bama Lama Bama Loo\" on Specialty Records. Due to his UK exposure, the song reached the top twenty there but only climbed to number 82 in his native country.{{sfn|White|2003|p=248}} Later in the year, he signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]], then on its dying legs, to release his \"comeback\" album, ''[[Little Richard Is Back (And There's a Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On!)|Little Richard Is Back]]''. Due to the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands as well as the rise of soul labels such as [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records]] and the popularity of [[James Brown]], Penniman's new releases were not well promoted or well received by radio stations . In November, 1964, [[Jimi Hendrix]] joined Penniman's Upsetters band as a full member.{{sfn|McDermott|2009|p=13}}<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Havers |first2=Richard |last2=Evans |title=The Golden Age of Rock 'N' Roll |publisher=Chartwell Books |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZSeU_rmdxYC&pg=PA126 |page=126 |isbn=978-0785826255}}</ref> In the Spring of 1965, Penniman took Hendrix and Billy Preston to a New York studio where they recorded the [[Don Covay]] soul ballad, \"I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)\", which became a number 12 R&B hit.<ref>{{harvnb|McDermott|2009|p=12}}: Hendrix recording with Little Richard; {{harvnb|Shadwick|2003|pp=56\u201357}}: \"I Don't Know What You Got (But It's Got Me)\" recorded in New York City.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Three other songs were recorded during the sessions, \"Dance A Go Go\" aka \"Dancin' All Around The World\", \"You Better Stop\", and \"Come See About Me\" (possibly an instrumental), but \u201cYou Better Stop\u201d was not issued until 1971 and \u201cCome See About Me\u201d , has yet to see the light of day.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=57}}}}\n\nHendrix and Penniman clashed over the spotlight, Hendrix's tardiness, wardrobe and Hendrix's stage antics. Hendrix also complained over not being properly paid by Penniman. In July 1965, Richard's Brother Charles fired Jimi [This is possibly incorrect. Jimi wrote to his father, Al Hendrix, that he quit Little Richard over money problems - he was owed 1,000 dollars.] Hendrix then rejoined [[The Isley Brothers]]' band, the IB Specials.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|pp=56\u201360}} Penniman later signed with [[Modern Records]], releasing a modest charter, \"Do You Feel It?\" before leaving for [[Okeh Records]] in early 1966. Two poorly produced albums were released over time, first a live album, cut at the Domino, in Atlanta, Georgia. Okeh paired Penniman with his old friend, [[Larry Williams]], who produced two albums on Penniman, including the studio release, ''[[The Explosive Little Richard]]'', which produced the modest charters \"Poor Dog\" and \"Commandments of Love\". His second Okeh album, ''Little Richard's Greatest Hits Recorded Live!'', returned him to the album charts.<ref name=\"HallofFame1986\">{{cite web|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|year=1986|title=Little Richard|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/little-richard/|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|White|2003|pp=253\u2013255}}{{sfn|White|2003|pp=268\u2013269}} In 1967, Penniman signed with [[Brunswick Records]] but after clashing with the label over musical direction, he left the label that same year.\n\n[[File:Little Richard (1967).png|thumb|left|180px|Little Richard in 1967]]\n\nPenniman felt that producers on his labels worked in not promoting his records during this period. Later, he claimed they kept trying to push him to records similar to Motown and felt he wasn't treated with appropriate respect.<ref>\"Religion and Rock and Roll\", ''Joel Martin Show'', WBAB 102.3 FM, NY. Guests: [[Harry Hepcat]] and Little Richard, August 16, 1981.</ref> Little Richard often performed in dingy clubs and lounges with little support from his label. While Penniman managed to perform in huge venues overseas such as England and France, Penniman was forced to perform in the [[Chitlin' Circuit]]. Penniman's flamboyant look, while a hit during the 1950s, failed to help his labels to promote him to more conservative black record buyers.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=41}} Penniman later claimed that his decision to \"[[backslide]]\" from his ministry, led religious clergymen to protest his new recordings.{{sfn|White|2003|p=132}} Making matters worse, Penniman said, was his insistence on performing in front of integrated audiences at the time of the black liberation movement shortly after the [[Watts riots]] and the formation of the [[Black Panthers]] prevented many black radio disk jockeys in certain areas of the country, including Los Angeles, to play his music.{{sfn|White|2003|p=133}} Now acting as his manager, Larry Williams convinced Penniman to focus on his live shows. By 1968, he had ditched the Upsetters for his new backup band, the Crown Jewels, performing on the Canadian TV show, \"Where It's At\". Penniman was also featured on the [[Monkees]] TV special ''[[33\u2153 Revolutions per Monkee]]'' in April 1969. Williams booked Penniman shows in [[Las Vegas]] casinos and resorts, leading Penniman to adapt a wilder flamboyant and androgynous look, inspired by the success of his former backing guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Penniman was soon booked at rock festivals such as the [[Atlantic City Pop Festival]] where he stole the show from headliner [[Janis Joplin]]. Penniman produced a similar show stealer at the Toronto Pop Festival with [[John Lennon]] as the headliner. These successes brought Little Richard to talk shows such as the ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and the ''[[Dick Cavett Show]]'', making him a major celebrity again.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nResponding to his reputation as a successful concert performer, [[Reprise Records]] signed Penniman in 1970 where he released the album, ''[[The Rill Thing]]'', with the philosophical single, \"Freedom Blues\", becoming his biggest charted single in years. In May 1970, Penniman made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Despite the success of \"Freedom Blues\", none of Penniman's other Reprise singles charted with the exception of \"Greenwood, Mississippi\", a swamp rock original by guitar hero, Travis Wammack, who incidentally played on the track. It charted only briefly on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and Cash Box pop chart, also on the Billboard Country charts; made a strong showing on WWRL in New York, before disappearing. Penniman became a featured guest instrumentalist and vocalist on recordings by acts such as [[Delaney and Bonnie]], [[Joey Covington]] and [[Joe Walsh]] and was prominently featured on [[Canned Heat]]'s 1972 hit single, \"Rockin' with the King\". To keep up with his finances and bookings, Penniman and three of his brothers formed a management company, Bud Hole Incorporated.{{sfn|White|2003|p=168}} By 1972, Penniman had entered the rock and roll revival circuit, and that year, he co-headlined the [[London Rock and Roll Show]] at Wembley Stadium with fellow peer [[Chuck Berry]] where he'd come onstage and announce himself \"the king of rock and roll\", fittingly also the title of his 1971 album with Reprise and told the packed audience there to \"let it all hang out\"; Penniman however was booed during the show when he climbed on top of his piano and stopped singing; he also seemed to ignore much of the crowd. To make matters worse, he showed up with just five musicians, and struggled through low lighting and bad microphones. When the concert film documenting the show came out, his performance was considered generally strong, though his fans noticed a drop in energy and vocal artistry. Two songs he performed did not make the final cut of the film. The following year, he recorded a charting \nsoul ballad, \"In the Middle of the Night\", released with proceeds donated to victims of [[tornadoes]] that had caused damage in 12 states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|title=New York Beat|date=July 5, 1973|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|volume=44|number=15|page=62}}</ref> In 1976, Penniman re-recorded eighteen of his classic rock and roll hits in Nashville for [[K-Tel Records]], in high tech stereo recreations, with a single featuring live versions of \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" and \"Rip It Up\" reaching the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name=\"betts\">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952\u20132004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 978-0-00-717931-2| page=457}}</ref> Penniman's performances began to take a toll by 1973, however, suffering from voice problems and quirky marathon renditions.

He departed from [[boogie-woogie]]'s [[shuffle rhythm]] and introduced a new distinctive rock beat, where the beat division is even at all [[tempo]]s. He reinforced the new rock rhythm with a two-handed approach, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically popping out in the piano's high [[Register (music)|register]]. His new rhythm, which he introduced with \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" (1955), became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by [[Chuck Berry]].<ref>Michael Campbell & James Brody (2007), ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA115 page 115]</ref> \"[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]\" (1957) foreshadowed the rhythmic feel of 1960s [[classic rock]] in several ways, including its heavy [[bassline]], slower tempo, strong rock beat played by the entire band, and [[verse\u2013chorus form]] similar to blues.<ref>Michael Campbell & James Brody (2007), ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA117 page 117]</ref>\n\nPenniman's voice was able to generate croons, wails, and screams unprecedented in popular music.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> He was cited by two of soul music's pioneers, [[Otis Redding]] and [[Sam Cooke]], as contributing to that genre's early development.
