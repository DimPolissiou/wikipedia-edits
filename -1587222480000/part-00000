Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

1943&nbsp;\u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|340x340px|The first WDM2 built 18040 preserved at national rail museum.]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233 and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|370x370px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by Alco. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service/Codal life.

Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233 and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by Alco. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service/Codal life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number.

The Reformist faction stood faithful with him later organised into an Independent Reformed Syrian Church and governed by their own bishop which later adopted the name Marthoma Syrian Church of Malabar.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early life===\n\nThomas Mar Athanasius, the first son of [[Abraham Malpan]] and Aleyamma was born into the Palakunnathu family of Maramon and was the brother of [[Titus I Mar Thoma|Titus I Mar Thoma Metropolitan]]. \nHis predecessor Mathews Mar Athanasius consecrated Thomas Mar Athanasius of Palakkunnathu Family, as his successor in 1869 in presence of Joseph Mar Koorilose (Alathoorey), [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].\n\n===Reformation in the Malankara Syrian Church===\n\nDuring the time of Mathews Mar Athanasius, there was a strong uprising in the church for renaissance and reformation inspired by [[Anglicanism|Anglican missionaries]] and scriptural education; and a strong opposition against it led by [[Mar Dionysius V]]. Thomas Mar Athanasius, continued the footsteps of his predecessor's reformation policy.\n\nThere were no proper Theological education for Clergy, Holy communion was conducted for money, the church buildings belonged to one or two respected families of the parish and they managed the affairs of church on behalf of others. There was no proper accounting or Auditing of church income or records. Church service was conducted in Syriac and majority of the parishioners could not understand any word of it. Palakkunathu Thomas Mar Athanasious initiated a large number of reforms at Church administration and at parish level like his predecessor.\n\nMalankara Church was never under any other church. however the opposition party Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Divaniyos II in 1876,Brought Patriarch of Antioch to preside over the Synod held at Mulanthuruthi. For the First time a group of Malankara Church came under the direct control of Church of Antioch. The Patriarch divided Malankara Church into seven dioceses and consecrated bishops for each dioceses. Mar Dionysious V was given charge of Quilon dioceses. This helped Mar Dionysius to tighten his hold over the traditional Syrian Church in temporal as well as in spiritual affairs. Palakkunnathu Mathews Mar Athanasious Malankara Metropolitan, his Suffragan Thomas Mar Athanasius metropolitan and the churches sided with Malankara Metropolitan did not attend the Synod neither agreed to their deliberations.

Thomas Mar Athanasius, continued the footsteps of his predecessor's reformation policy.\n\nThere were no proper Theological education for Clergy, Holy communion was conducted for money, the church buildings belonged to one or two respected families of the parish and they managed the affairs of church on behalf of others. There was no proper accounting or Auditing of church income or records. Church service was conducted in Syriac and majority of the parishioners could not understand any word of it. Palakkunathu Thomas Mar Athanasious initiated a large number of reforms at Church administration and at parish level like his predecessor.\n\nMalankara Church was never under any other church. however the opposition party Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Divaniyos II in 1876,Brought Patriarch of Antioch to preside over the Synod held at Mulanthuruthi. For the First time a group of Malankara Church came under the direct control of Church of Antioch. The Patriarch divided Malankara Church into seven dioceses and consecrated bishops for each dioceses. Mar Dionysious V was given charge of Quilon dioceses. This helped Mar Dionysius to tighten his hold over the traditional Syrian Church in temporal as well as in spiritual affairs. Palakkunnathu Mathews Mar Athanasious Malankara Metropolitan, his Suffragan Thomas Mar Athanasius metropolitan and the churches sided with Malankara Metropolitan did not attend the Synod neither agreed to their deliberations.

Large landowners, who often resided in England, rented land out to tenant farmers, whose tenure on the land was often precarious.  This led to significant resistance from the local population when rents were adjusted, leading to periodic eruptions of violence.  Moreover, the rural areas surrounding the town suffered from endemic poverty.  The Royal Commission into the Condition of the Poorer Classes in Ireland, published in 1838, provided some data on the living conditions of the rural poor living near Crossmolina.  The diet of the poor was almost entirely potatoes, while the consumption of meat was very rare (estimated to be only once or twice a year).  Laborers could expect a daily payment of between 6 and 8 pennies per day, with some element of wages being paid in the form of food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condition of the poorer classes in Ireland : appendix D: baronial examination on earnings of labourers, etc|author1=Whately, R. |author2=Murray |author3=Vignoles |author4=O'Ferrall |author5=Carlisle |author6=Hort |author7=Corrie |author8=Naper |author9=Wrightson|publisher=UK Parliament|year=1836|isbn=|location=British Parliamentary Publications; University of Southampton Library|pages=Parliamentary Papers, Session 1836, Vol. XXXI, p.1|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first decade of the century, local peasants formed a secret society called \"The Threshers\".

The league was a non-sectarian nationalist political party that briefly flourished prior to the first world war. Its main objective was to form a broad coalition between the Unionist and Nationalist populations. The league was opposed by more Catholic nationalist organisations such as the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] (AOH) and the [[United Irish League]].\n\nO'Brien had scheduled a meeting in the town, and fearing a conflict with the local population, he was accompanied by large contingent of police as well as a large number of AFIL supporters.  When he entered the town, he was confronted by a large group of locals armed with sticks and rocks.  O'Brien planned to speak at an open-air meeting at the corner of Chapel Street.  To get him to chapel street, the police baton-charged the crowd, eventually succeeding in pushing the locals back and allowing O'Brien to speak. However, the Lahardane Fife and Drum band began to play while the locals started shouting preventing O'Brien from being heard.  Further violence broke out and a revolver was fired as AFIL retreated from the town towards Ballina. O'Brien was struck on the head by a stick by one of the rioters.

The town contained \"one good street and two converging ones\" Lewis also enumerated the main local landlords:<blockquote>'There are several gentlemen's seats in the vicinity: the principal are Eniscoe, the residence of M.

Large landowners, who often resided in England, rented land out to tenant farmers, whose tenure on the land was often precarious.  This led to significant resistance from the local population when rents were adjusted, leading to periodic eruptions of violence.  Moreover, the rural areas surrounding the town suffered from endemic poverty.  The Royal Commission into the Condition of the Poorer Classes in Ireland, published in 1838, provided some data on the living conditions of the rural poor living near Crossmolina.  The diet of the poor was almost entirely potatoes, while the consumption of meat was very rare (estimated to be only once or twice a year).  Laborers could expect a daily payment of between 6 and 8 pennies per day, with some element of wages being paid in the form of food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condition of the poorer classes in Ireland : appendix D: baronial examination on earnings of labourers, etc|author1=Whately, R. |author2=Murray |author3=Vignoles |author4=O'Ferrall |author5=Carlisle |author6=Hort |author7=Corrie |author8=Naper |author9=Wrightson|publisher=UK Parliament|year=1836|isbn=|location=British Parliamentary Publications; University of Southampton Library|pages=Parliamentary Papers, Session 1836, Vol. XXXI, p.1|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first decade of the century, local peasants formed a secret society called \"The Threshers\".

The league was a non-sectarian nationalist political party that briefly flourished prior to the first world war. Its main objective was to form a broad coalition between the Unionist and Nationalist populations. The league was opposed by more Catholic nationalist organisations such as the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] (AOH) and the [[United Irish League]].\n\nO'Brien had scheduled a meeting in the town, and fearing a conflict with the local population, he was accompanied by large contingent of police as well as a large number of AFIL supporters.  When he entered the town, he was confronted by a large group of locals armed with sticks and rocks.  O'Brien planned to speak at an open-air meeting at the corner of Chapel Street.  To get him to chapel street, the police baton-charged the crowd, eventually succeeding in pushing the locals back and allowing O'Brien to speak. However, the Lahardane Fife and Drum band began to play while the locals started shouting preventing O'Brien from being heard.  Further violence broke out and a revolver was fired as AFIL retreated from the town towards Ballina. O'Brien was struck on the head by a stick by one of the rioters.

Imber wrote the first version of the poem in 1877, while he was a guest of a Jewish scholar in [[Ia\u0219i]], [[Romania]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hatikvah (first recording).ogg|thumb|upright|The first recording of \"Hatikvah\" ({{Lang-he-n|\u00ab\u05d4\u05b7\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05e7\u05b0\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\u00bb}}), performed by Hulda Lashanska in 1920]]\nThe text of Hatikvah was written in 1878 by [[Naphtali Herz Imber]], a Jewish poet from [[Zolochiv]] ({{lang-pl|Z\u0142ocz\u00f3w}}), a city nicknamed \"The City of Poets\",<ref>{{citation|first = Jakob|last=Weiss|title=[[The Lemberg Mosaic]]|place=New York|publisher=Alderbrook|year =2011|page=59}}.</ref> then in [[Austrian Poland]], today in [[Ukraine]].

It did not officially become the national anthem until November 2004, when an abbreviated and edited version was sanctioned by the [[Knesset]]<ref name=VivianEden/> in an amendment to the Flag and Coat-of-Arms Law (now renamed the Flag, Coat-of-Arms, and National Anthem Law).\n\nIn its modern rendering, the official text of the anthem incorporates only the first stanza and refrain of the original poem. The predominant theme in the remaining stanzas is the establishment of a [[self-determination|sovereign]] and free nation in the Land of Israel, a hope largely seen as fulfilled with the founding of the State of Israel.\n\n===Music===\n\n:<score sound=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \n  \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n  \\tempo 4 = 80\n  \\key f \\major\n  \\time 4/4\n  d8 e f g a4 a8 a bes a bes d a4. a8 g4 g8 g f4 f e8 d e f d4.\n}\n</score>\n\nThe melody for \"Hatikvah\" derives from \"[[La Mantovana]]\", a 16th-century [[Italian culture|Italian]] song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text \"Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo\". Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado's collection of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s. It was later known in early 17th-century [[Italy]] as {{Citation | title = Ballo di Mantova}}. This melody gained wide currency in [[Renaissance Europe]], under various titles, such as the {{Citation | language = Polish  | title = Pod Krakowem}}, {{Citation | language = Romanian | title = Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus |trans-title=[[Maize]] with up-standing leaves}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFUAKNSBMJ8|title=Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus - Didina Curea|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics:  https://lyricstranslate.com/en/cucuruz-cu-frunza-n-sus-traditional-version-no-2-maize-raised-leaf-traditional-version.html</ref> and the {{Citation | language = Ukrainian | title = Kateryna Kucheryava}}.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://torban.org/torban4b.html | title = IV.

Cohen himself recalled many years later that he had hummed Hatikvah based on the melody from the song he had heard in [[Romania]], {{Citation | title = Carul cu boi |trans-title=The Ox-Driven Cart}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adTjy-TIW_Q|title=Carul cu boi|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjq_rZPgoWI|title=\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05db\u05d5\u05d2\u05df - \u05de\u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d9)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics: https://lyricstranslate.com/en/carul-cu-boi-ox-driven-cart.html</ref>\n\nThe harmony of \"Hatikvah\" follows a [[Major and minor#Major and minor scales|minor scale]], which is often perceived as mournful in tone and is uncommon in national anthems. As the title \"The Hope\" and the words suggest, the import of the song is optimistic and the overall spirit uplifting.\n\n===Use in sporting events===\nThe Israeli national anthem is used in several European sporting events<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/245166|title=Israeli judoka wins gold, hears Hatikva at Europe championship|website=Israel National News}}</ref> since the [[Arab world|Arab states]] barred Israel from participating in their own continent's sporting bodies.

More specifically, Margalit and Halbertal cover the various responses towards \"Hatikvah\", which they establish as the original anthem of a Zionist movement, one that holds a two thousand year long hope of returning to the homeland (\u201cZion and Jerusalem\u201d) after a long period of exile.\n\nTo introduce the controversy of Israel's national anthem, the authors provide two instances where \"Hatikvah\" is rejected for the estrangement that it creates between the minority cultural groups of Israel and its national Jewish politics. Those that object find trouble in the mere fact that the national anthem is exclusively Jewish while a significant proportion of the state's citizenry is not Jewish and lacks any connection to the anthem's content and implications.\n\nAs Margalit and Halbertal continue to discuss, \"Hatikvah\" symbolises for many Arab-Israelis the struggle of loyalty that comes with having to dedicate oneself to either their historical or religious identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Margalit|first=Avishai|last2=Halbertal|first2=Moshe|orig-year=2004|title=Liberalism and the Right to Culture|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=71|pages=494\u2013497}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]] object to \"Hatikvah\" due to its explicit allusions to Jewishness.

It did not officially become the national anthem until November 2004, when an abbreviated and edited version was sanctioned by the [[Knesset]]<ref name=VivianEden/> in an amendment to the Flag and Coat-of-Arms Law (now renamed the Flag, Coat-of-Arms, and National Anthem Law).\n\nIn its modern rendering, the official text of the anthem incorporates only the first stanza and refrain of the original poem. The predominant theme in the remaining stanzas is the establishment of a [[self-determination|sovereign]] and free nation in the Land of Israel, a hope largely seen as fulfilled with the founding of the State of Israel.\n\n===Music===\n\n:<score sound=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \n  \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n  \\tempo 4 = 80\n  \\key f \\major\n  \\time 4/4\n  d8 e f g a4 a8 a bes a bes d a4. a8 g4 g8 g f4 f e8 d e f d4.\n}\n</score>\n\nThe melody for \"Hatikvah\" derives from \"[[La Mantovana]]\", a 16th-century [[Italian culture|Italian]] song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text \"Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo\". Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado's collection of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s. It was later known in early 17th-century [[Italy]] as {{Citation | title = Ballo di Mantova}}.

Jacobson, [https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/3010604/jewish/Bentching-vs-Hatikva-Torah-vs-the-UN.htm  Bentching vs. Hatikva; Torah vs. the UN], Chabad.org, originally published in summer 2013, accessed 30 January 2019</ref>\n\nRabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] wrote an alternative anthem titled \"[[HaEmunah]]\" (\"The Faith\") which he proposed as a replacement for \"Hatikvah\". But he did not object to the singing of \"Hatikvah\", and in fact endorsed it.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.lookstein.org/resources/hatikvah1.htm | first = Rav | last = Kook | title = Response to Hatikvah | quote = In more recent years, some Israeli Mizrahi (Eastern) Jews have criticised the song's western perspective. For Iraqi and Persian Jews, for example, the Land of Israel was in the west, and it was to this direction that they focused their prayers.}}</ref>\n\n===Objections by non-Jewish Israelis===\n''Liberalism and the Right to Culture'', written by Avishai Margalit and Moshe Halbertal, provides a social scientific perspective on the cultural dynamics in Israel, a country that is a vital home to many diverse religious groups. More specifically, Margalit and Halbertal cover the various responses towards \"Hatikvah\", which they establish as the original anthem of a Zionist movement, one that holds a two thousand year long hope of returning to the homeland (\u201cZion and Jerusalem\u201d) after a long period of exile.\n\nTo introduce the controversy of Israel's national anthem, the authors provide two instances where \"Hatikvah\" is rejected for the estrangement that it creates between the minority cultural groups of Israel and its national Jewish politics. Those that object find trouble in the mere fact that the national anthem is exclusively Jewish while a significant proportion of the state's citizenry is not Jewish and lacks any connection to the anthem's content and implications.\n\nAs Margalit and Halbertal continue to discuss, \"Hatikvah\" symbolises for many Arab-Israelis the struggle of loyalty that comes with having to dedicate oneself to either their historical or religious identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Margalit|first=Avishai|last2=Halbertal|first2=Moshe|orig-year=2004|title=Liberalism and the Right to Culture|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=71|pages=494\u2013497}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]] object to \"Hatikvah\" due to its explicit allusions to Jewishness.

Later at [[Survivor Series (2014)|Survivor Series]], Slater remained and Titus O'Neil lost to Adam Rose and The Bunny.
