The team was established in 1903, the first year of the PCL.\n\n==Franchise history==\nMany baseball teams have been known as the Portland Beavers; the most recent club, which began operating in 2001, recognized the history of all previous incarnations as its own, stating it was established in 1903, the same year the Pacific Coast League was established. The \"Beavers\" originated in 1906 following a newspaper contest to rename the existing Portland team that had been created in 1901 when a group of Portland businessmen founded the Portland Baseball Club.\n\nAlong with the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]], [[Sacramento Solons]], [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], and [[Seattle Rainiers]], a Portland Beavers club was a charter member of the Pacific Coast League in 1903. Portland and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] were the only two charter cities that had a team in the PCL as of 2010, the other cities having been taken over by [[Major League Baseball]] franchises.\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, the Beavers were placed for sale and relocation because of the lack of a suitable stadium in Portland, as [[PGE Park]] was being remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for [[Major League Soccer]]'s 2011 expansion [[Portland Timbers]]. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff Moorad, owner of the [[San Diego Padres]].<ref name=\"tucson\">{{cite web|url=http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101014&content_id=15635170&vkey=news_sd&c_id=sd|title=Moorad agrees to purchase Triple-A club | author = Corey Brock \u2013 MLB.com|date= October 14, 2010|publisher=Major League Baseball |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The team temporarily moved to southern Arizona and became the [[Tucson Padres]] while awaiting a new purpose-built stadium in their planned future home of [[Escondido, California]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/sports/report/121810_tucson_padres/tucsons-new-triple-a-team-announces-name-tucson-padres/ |date=December 18, 2010 |last=Smith |first=Dylan |title=Tucson's new Triple-A team announces name: Tucson Padres |newspaper=Tucson Sentinel}}</ref> After the 2013 season, the Padres instead moved to [[El Paso, Texas]] and became the [[El Paso Chihuahuas]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alameda |first1=Damien |title=Tucson Padres become El Paso Chihuahuas |url=https://www.kold.com/story/23763428/tucson-padres-become-el-paso-chihuahuas/ |website=kold.com |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of a Portland team: 1903\u20131918===\nOn December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the owner of the [[California League]]'s San Francisco team announced that the [[Pacific Northwest League]] team from Portland, the [[Portland Webfoots]], and a new team from [[Seattle]] were joining with the California League to create the Pacific Coast League (PCL).<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |title=Beavers History |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20090213&content_id=509331&vkey=team4_t248&fext=.jsp&sid=t248 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100409153325/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20090213&content_id=509331&vkey=team4_t248&fext=.jsp&sid=t248 |archivedate=2010-04-09 |website=minorleaguebaseball.com |publisher=Portland Beavers |accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref> Before the Portland franchise joined the PCL, the president of the Pacific Northwest League, Henry Lucas, was adamant in keeping the Portland franchise in his league.<ref name=\"The Deseret News\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xt4oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1099,3742661&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |title=Merry Fight Over Baseball |author= |work=The Deseret News |publisher=The Deseret News |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> A team in the Pacific Northwest League was formed called the Portland Green Gages, which folded early in its first season.

In 1910, Portland won another pennant behind the pitching of [[Vean Gregg]] and [[Gene Krapp]]. Gregg finished the season with a 32\u201318 record and 14 [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]]s while Krapp had a 29\u201316 record for the season. Portland repeated as PCL champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game-winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at [[Vaughn Street Park]]. His obituary later read that the ballpark was \"the sensation of baseball, because it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation.\" The NAPBL made a change to league classifications in 1912, making Double-A the top tier. The PCL, and the Portland Beavers, moved into this new classification from the previous top tier Class A league.\n[[File:Walt McCredie, Portland Beavers.jpg|left|thumb|Former Beavers manager and part owner [[Judge McCredie|Walt McCredie]].]]\nDuring the 1910s, the Beavers developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 the Portland Beavers had their own farm team which played in the [[Northwest League]] (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. During the 1914 season, the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also had an informal relationship with the [[Cleveland Indians]] through much of the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland to fine-tune their skills.\n\nPortland played well in 1913 and 1914, winning the pennant both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured future Hall of Famer [[Stan Coveleski]], the team didn't fare too well, and started into a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the '''Portland Buckaroos''' and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 7 due to the war) in second place 1\u00bd games back of Seattle. Ironically, the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue play due to restrictions on travel.\n\nDue to the Beavers' withdrawal from the PCL, the league offered Sacramento a franchise to replace the Portland team, while the McCredies continued to own the baseball club in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the [[Sacramento Solons|Sacramento Senators]], and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball Club.\n\n===Return to the Pacific Coast League: 1919\u20131972===\nWith the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered an expansion franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh place, only ahead of last-place Seattle who was also an expansion team that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to [[Walter Klepper]] who had been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in the 35-year old [[Jim Thorpe]], who played outfield and first base with the Beavers in 1922,<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34232994/jim_thorpe_is_purchased_by_portland/ \"Jim Thorpe is Purchased by Beavers,\"] ''Oregon Daily Journal'' [Portland], vol. 20, no. 291 (Feb. 10, 1922), p. 14.</ref> paying him a then-unheard of minor league salary of US$1,000 per month.\n\nIt wasn't long before Klepper was in the middle of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]. Klepper had brought Seattle player-manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, only Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until 1924.<ref name=100greatest>Weiss, Bill and Marshall Wright. [http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=22  \"Historians Weiss, Wright Rank 100 Best Minor League Baseball Teams.\"] Minor League Baseball. 2001. Retrieved September 27, 2008.</ref> According to ''The Portland Beavers'', a book by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, \"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed.\" Kenworthy did manage the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular [[player-manager]] [[Jim Middleton (baseball)|Jim Middleton]]. He was fired mid-season, though, as he was not able to generate support from the players.<ref name=100greatest/> The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that future Hall of Famer [[Mickey Cochrane]] played on the team.\n\nAfter 1924, the Beavers officially became a farm team for a major league team for the first time when [[Philadelphia Athletics]] owners [[John Shibe|John]] and [[Tom Shibe]] purchased the Beavers as well as [[Vaughn Street Park]]. Despite having [[Duffy Lewis]] on the team in 1925 (winning the PCL batting title), [[Elmer Smith (20th century outfielder)|Elmer Smith]] in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927), and [[Ike Boone]] in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of the league.\n\nLongtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the [[World Series]]. Benevento retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento died in 1969, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' stated, \"He adored kids...he loved baseball...and most of all he loved people.\" His funeral had an overflowing crowd that included [[Oregon Governor]] [[Tom McCall]]. Benevento stayed with the team 40 years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland.\n\nIn 1929, the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known that year as the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck as they finished with a 90\u2013112 record. Long\u2013time radio broadcaster Rollie Truitt also joined the Beavers staff in 1929, and worked for the team for 35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt would later be known as the \"Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters.\" In 1930, the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally be referred to as the Ducks for over a decade. The highlight of the Beavers last place 1930 season was William Rhiel's [[unassisted triple play]], the last recorded in PCL history.\n\nIn 1931, team President Tom Turner bought the franchise from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the positive. [[Ed Coleman (baseball)|Ed Coleman]] led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team finished in third, winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom half of the league.\n\n[[File:Portland Beavers and Hollywood Stars pregame.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portland Beavers and [[Hollywood Stars]] managers before a game performing a comedy routine ([[Gilmore Field]] in the 1940s)]]\nFollowing the 1934 season, E.J. Shefter bought the team from Turner. The team improved in 1935, finishing one game over .500, and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing 1\u00bd games over runner-up [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland]], then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937, the Beavers finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young [[Ted Williams]]. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last place in 1939\u20131942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56\u2013122, that they were still 25 games behind the seventh-place team (the league had eight teams at that time).\n\nIn 1943, William Klepper, with partner George Norgan buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the team began referring to the team as the \"Lucky Beavers\" and Vaughn Street Park was known as \"Lucky Beaver Stadium.\"  With the United States firmly involved in World War II, local radio station [[KXL (AM)|KXL]] sold over $300,000 in war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would be dubbed \"The Lucky Beaver.\" Due to U.S. involvement in the war, the available pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow, the Beavers still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager [[Marv Owen]]. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland Embassy Suites). [[Oregon Governor]] [[Earl Snell]] presented a commemorative watch and gold and diamond [[Championship ring|ring]] to each player at the banquet. The watches were given to the players due to [[L. H. Gregory]] of ''The Oregonian'' requesting fans to donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's share of the team becoming the team's new owner.\n\nIn 1946, the Beavers fell to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games out of first. In 1947 [[Eddie Basinski]] joined the Beavers, and they finished third, losing to the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]] in the first round of the playoffs. The team drew, up to then, a team record of 421,000 fans that season. This record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when Triple-A Baseball returned to Portland.\n\nIn 1948, the team finish fifth, followed by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the [[Baseball color line|integration]] of the Pacific Coast League as [[Frankie Austin]] and Luis Marquez became Beavers. Beginning with the 1950 season, the Beavers finished fourth for four straight years. [[Clay Hopper]], who had been [[Jackie Robinson]]'s manager when he played for the [[Montreal Royals]] in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League was classified by the NAPBL as an \"open league.\" The open league was a step above Triple-A, and was an attempt by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third [[Major League Baseball|major league]].\n\nPlans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd and Holgate in Southeast Portland. Due to the [[Korean War]], among other issues, the stadium never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale to the community via [[Stock|public stock]], which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of first.\n\nIn 1956, the Beavers left the now-demolished Vaughn Street Park to move into 25,000-seat [[Multnomah Stadium]], today's Providence Park. Throughout most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the Triple-A affiliate of the [[American League]] Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as [[Sam McDowell|\"Sudden\" Sam McDowell]], [[Lou Piniella|Lou \"Mad Dog\" Piniella]], and [[Luis Tiant|Luis \"El Gigante\" Tiant]]. Later major league affiliations included the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nIn 1961, the Beavers signed the 56-year-old [[Satchel Paige]]. He pitched 25 innings for the Beavers, striking out 19 and giving up 18 earned runs without recording a decision.\n\nFollowing the 1972 season, principal owner Bill Cutler moved the team northeast to [[Spokane Indians|Spokane]], who had lost their PCL team to [[Albuquerque Dukes|Albuquerque]] after the 1971 season. For the next five seasons, Portland was in the [[Short season|short-season]] [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Short Season|Class A]] [[Northwest League]] (NWL) with the independent and non-conforming [[Portland Mavericks]], owned by actor [[Bing Russell]].\n\n===Triple-A returns to Portland: 1978\u20131993===\nThe PCL expanded in 1978 and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers, displacing the single-A Mavericks. The new Beavers played in [[Civic Stadium (Portland, Oregon)|Civic Stadium]] for sixteen seasons through 1993. In 1983, the Beavers won the PCL pennant, the first for Portland in 47 years.

As part of the relocation agreement, Civic Stadium was renovated in 2000 and renamed [[PGE Park]]. The Las Vegas Stars (the 1919\u201372 Beavers) became the Dodgers' top affiliate; they were renamed the [[Las Vegas 51s|51s]] for 2001.

The team was established in 1903, the first year of the PCL.\n\n==Franchise history==\nMany baseball teams have been known as the Portland Beavers; the most recent club, which began operating in 2001, recognized the history of all previous incarnations as its own, stating it was established in 1903, the same year the Pacific Coast League was established. The \"Beavers\" originated in 1906 following a newspaper contest to rename the existing Portland team that had been created in 1901 when a group of Portland businessmen founded the Portland Baseball Club.\n\nAlong with the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]], [[Sacramento Solons]], [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], and [[Seattle Rainiers]], a Portland Beavers club was a charter member of the Pacific Coast League in 1903. Portland and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] were the only two charter cities that had a team in the PCL as of 2010, the other cities having been taken over by [[Major League Baseball]] franchises.\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, the Beavers were placed for sale and relocation because of the lack of a suitable stadium in Portland, as [[PGE Park]] was being remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for [[Major League Soccer]]'s 2011 expansion [[Portland Timbers]]. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff Moorad, owner of the [[San Diego Padres]].<ref name=\"tucson\">{{cite web|url=http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101014&content_id=15635170&vkey=news_sd&c_id=sd|title=Moorad agrees to purchase Triple-A club | author = Corey Brock \u2013 MLB.com|date= October 14, 2010|publisher=Major League Baseball |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The team temporarily moved to southern Arizona and became the [[Tucson Padres]] while awaiting a new purpose-built stadium in their planned future home of [[Escondido, California]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/sports/report/121810_tucson_padres/tucsons-new-triple-a-team-announces-name-tucson-padres/ |date=December 18, 2010 |last=Smith |first=Dylan |title=Tucson's new Triple-A team announces name: Tucson Padres |newspaper=Tucson Sentinel}}</ref> After the 2013 season, the Padres instead moved to [[El Paso, Texas]] and became the [[El Paso Chihuahuas]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alameda |first1=Damien |title=Tucson Padres become El Paso Chihuahuas |url=https://www.kold.com/story/23763428/tucson-padres-become-el-paso-chihuahuas/ |website=kold.com |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of a Portland team: 1903\u20131918===\nOn December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the owner of the [[California League]]'s San Francisco team announced that the [[Pacific Northwest League]] team from Portland, the [[Portland Webfoots]], and a new team from [[Seattle]] were joining with the California League to create the Pacific Coast League (PCL).<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |title=Beavers History |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20090213&content_id=509331&vkey=team4_t248&fext=.jsp&sid=t248 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100409153325/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20090213&content_id=509331&vkey=team4_t248&fext=.jsp&sid=t248 |archivedate=2010-04-09 |website=minorleaguebaseball.com |publisher=Portland Beavers |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |archiveurl=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20090213&content_id=509331&vkey=team4_t248&fext=.jsp&sid=t248 |archivedate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> Before the Portland franchise joined the PCL, the president of the Pacific Northwest League, Henry Lucas, was adamant in keeping the Portland franchise in his league.<ref name=\"The Deseret News\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xt4oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1099,3742661&dq=pacific+northwest+league+portland&hl=en |title=Merry Fight Over Baseball |author= |work=The Deseret News |publisher=The Deseret News |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> A team in the Pacific Northwest League was formed called the Portland Green Gages, which folded early in its first season.

In 1910, Portland won another pennant behind the pitching of [[Vean Gregg]] and [[Gene Krapp]]. Gregg finished the season with a 32\u201318 record and 14 [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]]s while Krapp had a 29\u201316 record for the season. Portland repeated as PCL champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game-winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at [[Vaughn Street Park]]. His obituary later read that the ballpark was \"the sensation of baseball, because it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation.\" The NAPBL made a change to league classifications in 1912, making Double-A the top tier. The PCL, and the Portland Beavers, moved into this new classification from the previous top tier Class A league.\n[[File:Walt McCredie, Portland Beavers.jpg|left|thumb|Former Beavers manager and part owner [[Judge McCredie|Walt McCredie]].]]\nDuring the 1910s, the Beavers developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 the Portland Beavers had their own farm team which played in the [[Northwest League]] (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. During the 1914 season, the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also had an informal relationship with the [[Cleveland Indians]] through much of the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland to fine-tune their skills.\n\nPortland played well in 1913 and 1914, winning the pennant both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured future Hall of Famer [[Stan Coveleski]], the team didn't fare too well, and started into a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the '''Portland Buckaroos''' and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 7 due to the war) in second place 1\u00bd games back of Seattle. Ironically, the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue play due to restrictions on travel.\n\nDue to the Beavers' withdrawal from the PCL, the league offered Sacramento a franchise to replace the Portland team, while the McCredies continued to own the baseball club in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the [[Sacramento Solons|Sacramento Senators]], and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball Club.\n\n===Return to the Pacific Coast League: 1919\u20131972===\nWith the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered an expansion franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh place, only ahead of last-place Seattle who was also an expansion team that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to [[Walter Klepper]] who had been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in the 35-year old [[Jim Thorpe]], who played outfield and first base with the Beavers in 1922,<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34232994/jim_thorpe_is_purchased_by_portland/ \"Jim Thorpe is Purchased by Beavers,\"] ''Oregon Daily Journal'' [Portland], vol. 20, no. 291 (Feb. 10, 1922), p. 14.</ref> paying him a then-unheard of minor league salary of US$1,000 per month.\n\nIt wasn't long before Klepper was in the middle of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]. Klepper had brought Seattle player-manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, only Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until 1924.<ref name=100greatest>Weiss, Bill and Marshall Wright. [http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=22  \"Historians Weiss, Wright Rank 100 Best Minor League Baseball Teams.\"] Minor League Baseball. 2001. Retrieved September 27, 2008.</ref> According to ''The Portland Beavers'', a book by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, \"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed.\" Kenworthy did manage the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular [[player-manager]] [[Jim Middleton (baseball)|Jim Middleton]]. He was fired mid-season, though, as he was not able to generate support from the players.<ref name=100greatest/> The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that future Hall of Famer [[Mickey Cochrane]] played on the team.\n\nAfter 1924, the Beavers officially became a farm team for a major league team for the first time when [[Philadelphia Athletics]] owners [[John Shibe|John]] and [[Tom Shibe]] purchased the Beavers as well as [[Vaughn Street Park]]. Despite having [[Duffy Lewis]] on the team in 1925 (winning the PCL batting title), [[Elmer Smith (20th century outfielder)|Elmer Smith]] in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927), and [[Ike Boone]] in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of the league.\n\nLongtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the [[World Series]]. Benevento retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento died in 1969, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' stated, \"He adored kids...he loved baseball...and most of all he loved people.\" His funeral had an overflowing crowd that included [[Oregon Governor]] [[Tom McCall]]. Benevento stayed with the team 40 years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland.\n\nIn 1929, the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known that year as the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck as they finished with a 90\u2013112 record. Long\u2013time radio broadcaster Rollie Truitt also joined the Beavers staff in 1929, and worked for the team for 35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt would later be known as the \"Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters.\" In 1930, the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally be referred to as the Ducks for over a decade. The highlight of the Beavers last place 1930 season was William Rhiel's [[unassisted triple play]], the last recorded in PCL history.\n\nIn 1931, team President Tom Turner bought the franchise from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the positive. [[Ed Coleman (baseball)|Ed Coleman]] led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team finished in third, winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom half of the league.\n\n[[File:Portland Beavers and Hollywood Stars pregame.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portland Beavers and [[Hollywood Stars]] managers before a game performing a comedy routine ([[Gilmore Field]] in the 1940s)]]\nFollowing the 1934 season, E.J. Shefter bought the team from Turner. The team improved in 1935, finishing one game over .500, and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing 1\u00bd games over runner-up [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland]], then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937, the Beavers finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young [[Ted Williams]]. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last place in 1939\u20131942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56\u2013122, that they were still 25 games behind the seventh-place team (the league had eight teams at that time).\n\nIn 1943, William Klepper, with partner George Norgan buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the team began referring to the team as the \"Lucky Beavers\" and Vaughn Street Park was known as \"Lucky Beaver Stadium.\"  With the United States firmly involved in World War II, local radio station [[KXL (AM)|KXL]] sold over $300,000 in war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would be dubbed \"The Lucky Beaver.\" Due to U.S. involvement in the war, the available pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow, the Beavers still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager [[Marv Owen]]. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland Embassy Suites). [[Oregon Governor]] [[Earl Snell]] presented a commemorative watch and gold and diamond [[Championship ring|ring]] to each player at the banquet. The watches were given to the players due to [[L. H. Gregory]] of ''The Oregonian'' requesting fans to donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's share of the team becoming the team's new owner.\n\nIn 1946, the Beavers fell to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games out of first. In 1947 [[Eddie Basinski]] joined the Beavers, and they finished third, losing to the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]] in the first round of the playoffs. The team drew, up to then, a team record of 421,000 fans that season. This record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when Triple-A Baseball returned to Portland.\n\nIn 1948, the team finish fifth, followed by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the [[Baseball color line|integration]] of the Pacific Coast League as [[Frankie Austin]] and Luis Marquez became Beavers. Beginning with the 1950 season, the Beavers finished fourth for four straight years. [[Clay Hopper]], who had been [[Jackie Robinson]]'s manager when he played for the [[Montreal Royals]] in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League was classified by the NAPBL as an \"open league.\" The open league was a step above Triple-A, and was an attempt by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third [[Major League Baseball|major league]].\n\nPlans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd and Holgate in Southeast Portland. Due to the [[Korean War]], among other issues, the stadium never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale to the community via [[Stock|public stock]], which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of first.\n\nIn 1956, the Beavers left the now-demolished Vaughn Street Park to move into 25,000-seat [[Multnomah Stadium]], today's Providence Park. Throughout most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the Triple-A affiliate of the [[American League]] Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as [[Sam McDowell|\"Sudden\" Sam McDowell]], [[Lou Piniella|Lou \"Mad Dog\" Piniella]], and [[Luis Tiant|Luis \"El Gigante\" Tiant]]. Later major league affiliations included the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nIn 1961, the Beavers signed the 56-year-old [[Satchel Paige]]. He pitched 25 innings for the Beavers, striking out 19 and giving up 18 earned runs without recording a decision.\n\nFollowing the 1972 season, principal owner Bill Cutler moved the team northeast to [[Spokane Indians|Spokane]], who had lost their PCL team to [[Albuquerque Dukes|Albuquerque]] after the 1971 season. For the next five seasons, Portland was in the [[Short season|short-season]] [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Short Season|Class A]] [[Northwest League]] (NWL) with the independent and non-conforming [[Portland Mavericks]], owned by actor [[Bing Russell]].\n\n===Triple-A returns to Portland: 1978\u20131993===\nThe PCL expanded in 1978 and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers, displacing the single-A Mavericks.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask to reveal their identity. This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain, and one is declared the winner after they perform again.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour.
