{"title_page": "William George Murray", "text_new": "'''William George Murray''' (1884 \u2013 2 December 1975) was a constable in the [[Northern Territory Police]] force who, in 1928, led a series of [[punitive expedition]]s against [[Aboriginal Australians]] that became known as the [[Coniston massacre]].\n\n==Early life==\nMurray was born near the small rural town of [[Yarck, Victoria|Yarck]] in the British colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1884. His father was a local farmer by the name of William Henry Murray who was married to Mary Jane Mills. He grew up on the \"Horton Vale\" family farm near Yarck where he remained until around 1910 when Murray and his parents moved to the inner [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]]. They lived at 62 Waterloo Road in Northcote.\n\n==First World War==\nIn 1914, at the age of thirty, Murray enlisted as a soldier in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] to fight in [[World War I]]. He was assigned to the [[4th Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|4th Light Horse Regiment]] and was shipped out to [[Egypt]] in October 1914. He later fought in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] where he was wounded twice.<ref name=\"Bradley\">{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Michael |title=Coniston |date=2019 |publisher=UWA Publishing |location=Perth}}</ref> In a letter to his parents, Murray described his participation in the battles at Gallipoli during August of 1915.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64751149 |title=Letter from the Front. |newspaper=Alexandra And Yea Standard And Yarck, Gobur, Thornton And Acheron Express |location=Victoria, Australia |date=29 October 1915 |access-date=11 January 2020 |page=3 |via=Trove }}</ref> Murray wrote about how the advancing Turks were mowed down with machine gun and artillery fire and how it was \"great fun and very exciting\". He also recounted the occasions in which he was nearly killed and described an incident in which he was shot in the shoulder. Due to this wound, Murray was evacuated from Gallipoli by ship and sent to a military hospital in [[Malta]]. Murray later returned to Gallipoli where he was promoted to [[lance corporal]]. In December 1915, he was transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and again promoted to sergeant. He remained at the front until the end of the war and was wounded twice more and was also treated for [[gonorrhoea]]. In October 1918, Murray was shipped back to Australia and he was discharged from the military forces in March 1919.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\n==Northern Territory Police==\n===Early postings===\nIn April 1919, Murray joined the [[Northern Territory Police]] as a constable and was posted to the very remote Ranken River police station on the [[Barkly Tableland]]. He received no formal training and in the following years was transferred to several outposts around the Territory. He was involved in capturing [[Aboriginal Australians]] who were killing the stock of Anglo-Australians who ran [[cattle station]]s in the region. Murray would either chain those he captured and escort them for judicial hearings in larger settlements such as [[Alice Springs]] or he would hand out summary punishment as he saw fit.<ref name=\"Cribbin\">{{cite book |last1=Cribbin |first1=John |title=The Killing Times |date=1984 |publisher=Fontana |location=Sydney}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Murray was transferred to the [[Barrow Creek, Northern Territory|Barrow Creek]] police station where he was given the additional title of [[Protector of Aborigines]] for the immediate region around Barrow Creek.<ref name=\"Cribbin\" />\n\n===Coniston massacre===\nIn August 1928, Murray was ordered to investigate the killing of a white man named Fred Brooks who was bludgeoned to death by several Aboriginal people at a waterhole to the west of Coniston cattle station near the modern-day settlement of [[Yuendumu]]. Murray led a [[punitive expedition]] from Coniston which resulted in the deaths of at least 17 mostly [[Warlpiri people]]. He took two survivors, named Akirkra and Padygar, as prisoners to the holding jail at [[Alice Springs]]. In early September, Murray went on another police mission to arrest Aboriginal cattle killers around the Coniston and Barrow Creek areas. An unknown number of Aboriginal people were possibly killed during this expedition with a further two Aboriginal prisoners, named Ned and Barney, taken to Alice Springs. From late September until mid October, Murray conducted a third punitive expedition to the north of Coniston along the Lander and Hanson Rivers. This last mission was in response to an attack on William \"Nugget\" Morton by Aboriginal people. Morton participated with Murray in this expedition where at least a further 14 [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] and [[Kaytetye people]] were shot dead. No prisoners were taken in this phase. These combined killings  conducted by Murray came to be known as the [[Coniston massacre]]. Officially, 31 men, women and children were killed during this police operation, although analysis of the existing documentation and surviving Aboriginal testimonies indicate that somewhere between 100 and 200 people were shot dead.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\nOf the four Aboriginal prisoners, Ned and Barney were sentenced at Alice Springs and served one month in the jail there for the spearing of cattle. Murray escorted the other two prisoners, Akirkra and Padygar, to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to face trial for the killing of Fred Brooks. At this trial, conducted in November 1928, Murray freely gave evidence to the presiding judge that he shot a large number of Aboriginals during the operation, that he shot to kill and shot dead wounded Aboriginals. The judge noted that Murray \"moved them down wholesale.\" The actual evidence against Akirkra and Padygar for killing Brooks was weak and they were acquitted. Murray's admissions in court however led to widespread publicity about the massacres and a governmental Board of Inquiry was set up to investigate the actions of constable Murray.<ref name=\"Cribbin\" />\n\nThe Board of Inquiry which ran from late December 1928 until the end of January 1929 was a [[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] set up to protect Murray and the colonial system in the Northern Territory. The board found that Murray and the other perpetrators of the massacres acted in self defence and that the shootings were justified. It found that the Aboriginals themselves were to blame and that more police patrols would be required to instil control upon the surviving Indigenous population. The board suggested that Murray should have more police training but this was never done.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\n===The Willaberta Jack arrest===\nSoon after the Board of Inquiry was finished, Murray was again out arresting Aboriginals. In February 1929, he was ordered to track down an Aboriginal man named Willaberta Jack who had shot dead a white man named Harry Henty. By late June, Murray had arrested Willaberta Jack and returned with him to Alice Springs. While Willaberta Jack was jailed there, Murray gave him a severe beating for which Murray was later fined \u00a35. Murray later escorted Jack to Darwin for trial where he was acquitted of murdering Henty. Willaberta Jack however died in police custody not long after his acquittal.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\n===Arltunga===\nAround 1931, Constable Murray was transferred to [[Arltunga Historical Reserve|Arltunga]] about 100km east of Alice Springs. Here he was also appointed as a gold warden in charge of the goldfields in the area. He took prospecting leases out for himself and also demanded Aboriginal people bring him samples of gold in return for the government rations that he was supposed to hand out to them. There is also a suggestion that Murray participated in another [[list of massacres of Aboriginal Australians|massacre]] or [[mass poisonings of Aboriginal Australians|mass poisoning of Aboriginal Australians]] at the nearby [[Sandover River]] while he was posted at Arltunga.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\nIn 1933, he was interviewed at Arltunga by the famous novelist [[Ernestine Hill]] where he again boasted of the various ways he had killed numerous Aboriginals.

Tony and Noah talk briefly about Tony's favorite film ''[[The Public Enemy]]''. Alone with him, Tony questions him about his background, and confirms that he is half [[Jewish]] and half [[African-American]]. Tony tells him to stay away from his daughter. Noah swears at him, then storms out. Tony goes to the kitchen, unwraps some cold cuts and then sees a box of [[Uncle Ben's Rice]], triggering a [[panic attack]].\n\nTony has read the newspaper headline: \"2nd Firebomb in Sanitation War\". He confronts [[Ralphie Cifaretto]], an ambitious and effective member of [[Richie Aprile]]'s crew, and [[Albert Barese]] about the sanitation dispute. He tells them firmly: \"No more fires.\" So, instead, Ralphie has a man beaten up with baseball bats. Separately, [[Ray Curto]] meets his handler from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]; he is 'cooperating'.\n\nTony visits his mother [[Livia Soprano|Livia]] in an attempt to set things straight, and tell her what to say if questioned about the stolen airline tickets. She seems to stonewall him. Exasperated, he walks out. That evening, Livia dies from a stroke. Later, Tony tells [[Dr. Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]], \"I'm glad she's dead.\" Then he bursts out that he is \"a bad son\". \n\nTony's sister [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Barbara Soprano Giglione|Barbara]] informs him that [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] will not be coming for the funeral. He furiously calls her in Seattle and tells her to be on the next plane; she inveigles him into paying the fare. At the [[funeral home]] Janice insists that, contrary to her wishes, Livia be given a lavish [[funeral]] and, exasperated, Tony agrees. In Livia's house, Janice hammers at the basement wall. At the funeral, still at the graveside, she has a dispute with Livia's carer [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Svetlana Kirilenko|Svetlana]] about Livia's collection of records. Svetlana says Livia gave them to her; Janice orders her to give them back. \n\nAt the post-funeral reception at the Sopranos' house Janice, against Tony's wishes, corrals everyone into the main room for a ceremony of remembrance. With some reluctance, one or two people speak in memory of Livia. [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]], doped up on [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]], gives a rambling, incoherent speech. Tony has slipped outside, where he is confronted by an angry and drunk [[Artie Bucco]], who remembers Livia telling him about Tony's [[The Sopranos (episode)|torching of the Vesuvio]].

Tony and Noah talk briefly about Tony's favorite film ''[[The Public Enemy]]''. Alone with him, Tony questions him about his background, and confirms that he is half [[Jewish]] and half [[African-American]]. Tony tells him to stay away from his daughter. Noah swears at him, then storms out. Tony goes to the kitchen, unwraps some cold cuts and then sees a box of [[Uncle Ben's Rice]], triggering a [[panic attack]].\n\nTony has read the newspaper headline: \"2nd Firebomb in Sanitation War\". He confronts [[Ralphie Cifaretto]], an ambitious and effective member of [[Richie Aprile]]'s crew, and [[Albert Barese]] about the sanitation dispute. He tells them firmly: \"No more fires.\" So, instead, Ralphie has a man beaten up with baseball bats. Separately, [[Ray Curto]] meets his handler from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]; he is 'cooperating'.\n\nTony visits his mother [[Livia Soprano|Livia]] in an attempt to set things straight, and tell her what to say if questioned about the stolen airline tickets. She seems to stonewall him. Exasperated, he walks out. That evening, Livia dies from a stroke. Later, Tony tells [[Dr. Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]], \"I'm glad she's dead.\" Then he bursts out that he is \"a bad son\". \n\nTony's sister [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Barbara Soprano Giglione|Barbara]] informs him that [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] will not be coming for the funeral. He furiously calls her in Seattle and tells her to be on the next plane; she inveigles him into paying the fare. At the [[funeral home]] Janice insists that, contrary to her wishes, Livia be given a lavish [[funeral]] and, exasperated, Tony agrees. In Livia's house, Janice hammers at the basement wall. At the funeral, still at the graveside, she has a dispute with Livia's carer [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Svetlana Kirilenko|Svetlana]] about Livia's collection of records. Svetlana says Livia gave them to her; Janice orders her to give them back. \n\nAt the post-funeral reception at the Sopranos' house Janice, against Tony's wishes, corrals everyone into the main room for a ceremony of remembrance. With some reluctance, one or two people speak in memory of Livia. [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]], doped up on [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]], gives a rambling, incoherent speech. Tony has slipped outside, where he is confronted by an angry and drunk [[Artie Bucco]], who remembers Livia telling him about Tony's [[The Sopranos (episode)|torching of the Vesuvio]]. Artie goes back inside and seems ready to speak about it but [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]], who has been drinking, suddenly says, \"This is such a crock of shit.\" She says that Livia was \"terribly dysfunctional\" and, \"even from the grave\" she \"spread no cheer\".   \n\nAfterwards, Tony sits in front of the television with a drink and watches the scene from ''The Public Enemy'' in which the main character's mother joyfully prepares her home for her son's return.

Due to her unusual hair color, Shirayuki was raised to always be careful of showing her hair in new surroundings and grew to be an independent young woman. However, her hair gets her noticed by Prince Raj, who orders her to become his concubine. Refusing his orders, she cuts her hair and leaves it behind as part of what he wanted and escapes to the neighboring kingdom of Clarines. On her way there, she meets and befriends Prince Zen and his two aides Mitsuhide and Kiki. When Zen is poisoned by an apple meant for Shirayuki gifted by Raj, Shirayuki successfully obtains the antidote and decides to accompany the trio to Clarines. Shortly thereafter, Shirayuki passes an exam for a position to train in the palace as a herbalist. Shirayuki and her friends find a place in Clarines and carries out her duties as a court herbalist. Over the course of the story, Zen and Shirayuki begin to fall in love with each other and eventually begin a romantic relationship, in spite of opposition due to their difference in social status.\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n;{{nihongo|Shirayuki|\u767d\u96ea}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|last1=Hodgkins|first1=Crystalyn|title=Akira Ishida, Yuko Kaida Join Snow White with the Red Hair Anime's Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-24/akira-ishida-yuko-kaida-join-snow-white-with-the-red-hair-anime-cast/.88510|website=Anime News Network|publisher=News|date=May 24, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2016|language=en}}</ref>|[[Brina Palencia]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite news|last1=Pineda|first1=Rafael Antonio|title=Funimation Reveals Snow White with the Red Hair Dub Cast|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-04/funimation-reveals-snow-white-with-the-red-hair-dub-cast/.97201|website=Anime News Network|publisher=News|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=February 15, 2016|language=en}}</ref>}}\n:Shirayuki is the main protagonist of the story. Born with rare red hair, she often has to hide it due to how it easily attracts attention. She escapes from the kingdom of Tanbarun after its prince orders her to become his concubine. Independent and persistent, she meets Zen on her second day in the kingdom of Clarines and befriends him after tending to his wounds. Later, she is accepted as a royal pharmacist and trains under Garack and Ryu. Shirayuki has demonstrated her abilities as a pharmacist in various situations, particularly in identifying and controlling disease outbreaks in foreign areas. She has a close relationship with Zen, and falls in love with him over the course of the story despite opposition due to their difference in social status. She moves into the east wing of Wistal Castle in chapter 49, and is later reassigned as a pharmacist to Lyrias for two years in chapter 53.\n;{{nihongo|Zen Wistaria|\u30bc\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2|Zen Wisutaria}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Josh Grelle]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Zen is the second prince of Clarines, and meets Shirayuki on a trip outside the castle. Shortly after befriending her, he is poisoned by an apple meant for Shirayuki, but obtains the antidote with her help. Initially, Zen is often seen escaping his duties to experience Clarines first-hand, though he has since taken more responsibility over official work. He has a close relationship with his three aides, Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi, and has both their respect and genuine loyalty. Over the course of the story, he falls in love with Shirayuki, and rescues her from various dangers.\n;{{nihongo|Mitsuhide Lowen|\u30df\u30c4\u30d2\u30c7\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3|Mitsuhide R\u016ben}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bichir\u014d Umehara]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Mitsuhide is one of Zen's closest aides, he was appointed by Prince Izana to watch over Zen (despite initially wanting to be Izana's retainer) and is a skilled swordsman. Though their relationship was initially rocky, he is seen by Zen as both a close friend and reliable aide. He is extremely loyal though somewhat clumsy at times, as well as a little silly. In chapter 92, he is offered a marriage proposal by Kiki, which he declines.\n;{{nihongo|Kiki Seiran|\u6728\u3005\u30fb\u30bb\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Nazuka]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Kiki is one of Zen's closest aides, and arrives at the castle some time after Mitsuhide. As the heir to the household of the Seiran family, her father expects her to return home to assume responsibility after her time serving Zen. Reserved, independent and intelligent, Kiki is extremely loyal to protecting Zen (and later Shirayuki as she becomes part of Zen's life) and is most often seen with Mitsuhide. She has stated (to Zen) that when the time comes, she will propose to Mitsuhide. Like Mitsuhide, she is skilled at swordplay and is often seen training the soldiers or dueling with him. In chapter 92, Kiki confesses and proposes to Mitsuhide, which he later declines.\n;{{nihongo|Obi|\u30aa\u30d3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Austin Tindle]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Obi is one of Zen's self-proclaimed aides. Originally sent by Marquis Haruka as a way to scare Shirayuki out of the castle, he later pledges himself to Zen after being discovered. It is hinted that he has feelings for Shirayuki, but his loyalty to both Zen and Shirayuki prevents him from acting out on his feelings. Obi has a relatively mysterious past as a loner, but finds himself drawn to protecting Zen, Shirayuki, and their respective goals. He later becomes Zen's official messenger. With his quick movements and reflexes, he is often sent by Zen to protect Shirayuki at times when he cannot leave his royal duties.

This makes trouble for her when she is chosen by the snooty Prince Raji Shenazard to be his concubine (a mistress), and instead of agreeing, flees to the neighbouring city of Clarines by hitching a ride on a carriage. She also cuts her long red hair, leaving it behind still with a ribbon tied to it, as her clear refusal to obey the prince. Once in Clarines, tired and hungry from her journey, she calls at a house but no one answers, so she sleeps outside until the next morning, when she meets Zen Wistalia and his companions Mitsuhide Lowen and Kiki Seiran. Zen offers her shelter in the house, while making her confess the reason why she escaped. When a basket of apples arrives for Shirayuki, with her hair in the ribbon tied to the handle, Zen bites into one and collapses. At that point a soldier from Tanbarun appears, he confirms that the apples were poisoned by Raji who holds the antidote, which he will hand over to Zen only if Shirayuki becomes his concubine. Shirayuki is brought to the royal palace of Tanbarun where she meets a smug Raji. After bravely agreeing to his proposal in exchange for Zen's antidote, Zen suddenly appears to defend her, revealing his resistance to poisons. He also introduces himself to Prince Raji as the second prince of Clarines, which means that their countries could end up going to war if he disclosed that Prince Raj's attempted to poison him. Afraid that he would be disgraced, Prince Raji has no choice but to give up on Shirayuki and allow her to leave with Zen. She decides to follow him to his land.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Following the Sound of Your Heart\n| AltTitle        = Tadoru wa Mune no Naru H\u014d e\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u8fbf\u308b\u306f\u80f8\u306e\u9cf4\u308b\u307b\u3046\u3078}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = Back in Clarines, Shirayuki treats Zen with herbs, and the following day she looks for a job as a herbalist in the city. Instead, she gets a suggestion to prepare for the exam for court herbalist apprentice. Feeling that this is her path, she travels to an island accompanied by Zen, to study and gather rare herbs. While in the island's forest she is captured by a man named Mihaya who has his eye on her red hair. In her cell Shirayuki takes advantage of the night to rub the ropes that tie her wrists against the rough wall, so that when her captor comes to leave food she can free herself, trapping Mihaya in his own cell. However, he manages to escape and corners her. She then places paralysing herbs in her oil lantern and smashes it against the wall to release their paralyzing fumes. She jumps out of a window onto a branch and falls to the ground. During her captivity Zen starts worrying about Shirayuki when he visits her place and is told by her landlady that she has not come back yet. Unfortunately, the paralysing gas only has a temporary effect on Mihaya so he is able to catches up with Shirayuki. Zen rescues her at the last minute, and hands Mihaya over to the royal guards. Mihaya claims that the reason for capturing Shirayuka is to parade her to elevate his status, since his family used to be wealthy but he is now penniless and in hiding.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Shining Time of Promise\n| AltTitle        = Yakusoku, Kagayaku Sonotoki ni\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u7d04\u675f\u3001\u8f1d\u304f\u305d\u306e\u6642\u306b}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Due to her closeness with Zen, Shirayuki is now a regular visitor to his castle with no restrictions.

Due to her unusual hair color, Shirayuki was raised to always be careful of showing her hair in new surroundings and grew to be an independent young woman. However, her hair gets her noticed by Prince Raj, who orders her to become his concubine. Refusing his orders, she cuts her hair and leaves it behind as part of what he wanted and escapes to the neighboring kingdom of Clarines. On her way there, she meets and befriends Prince Zen and his two aides Mitsuhide and Kiki. When Zen is poisoned by an apple meant for Shirayuki gifted by Raj, Shirayuki successfully obtains the antidote and decides to accompany the trio to Clarines. Shortly thereafter, Shirayuki passes an exam for a position to train in the palace as a herbalist. Shirayuki and her friends find a place in Clarines and carries out her duties as a court herbalist. Over the course of the story, Zen and Shirayuki begin to fall in love with each other and eventually begin a romantic relationship, in spite of opposition due to their difference in social status.\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n;{{nihongo|Shirayuki|\u767d\u96ea}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|last1=Hodgkins|first1=Crystalyn|title=Akira Ishida, Yuko Kaida Join Snow White with the Red Hair Anime's Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-24/akira-ishida-yuko-kaida-join-snow-white-with-the-red-hair-anime-cast/.88510|website=Anime News Network|publisher=News|date=May 24, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2016|language=en}}</ref>|[[Brina Palencia]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite news|last1=Pineda|first1=Rafael Antonio|title=Funimation Reveals Snow White with the Red Hair Dub Cast|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-04/funimation-reveals-snow-white-with-the-red-hair-dub-cast/.97201|website=Anime News Network|publisher=News|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=February 15, 2016|language=en}}</ref>}}\n:Shirayuki is the main protagonist of the story. Born with rare red hair, she often has to hide it due to how it easily attracts attention. She escapes from the kingdom of Tanbarun after its prince orders her to become his concubine. Independent and persistent, she meets Zen on her second day in the kingdom of Clarines and befriends him after tending to his wounds. Later, she is accepted as a royal pharmacist and trains under Garack and Ryu. Shirayuki has demonstrated her abilities as a pharmacist in various situations, particularly in identifying and controlling disease outbreaks in foreign areas. She has a close relationship with Zen, and falls in love with him over the course of the story despite opposition due to their difference in social status. She moves into the east wing of Wistal Castle in chapter 49, and is later reassigned as a pharmacist to Lyrias for two years in chapter 53.\n;{{nihongo|Zen Wistaria|\u30bc\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2|Zen Wisutaria}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Josh Grelle]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Zen is the second prince of Clarines, and meets Shirayuki on a trip outside the castle. Shortly after befriending her, he is poisoned by an apple meant for Shirayuki, but obtains the antidote with her help. Initially, Zen is often seen escaping his duties to experience Clarines first-hand, though he has since taken more responsibility over official work. He has a close relationship with his three aides, Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi, and has both their respect and genuine loyalty. Over the course of the story, he falls in love with Shirayuki, and rescues her from various dangers.\n;{{nihongo|Mitsuhide Lowen|\u30df\u30c4\u30d2\u30c7\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3|Mitsuhide R\u016ben}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bichir\u014d Umehara]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Mitsuhide is one of Zen's closest aides, he was appointed by Prince Izana to watch over Zen (despite initially wanting to be Izana's retainer) and is a skilled swordsman. Though their relationship was initially rocky, he is seen by Zen as both a close friend and reliable aide. He is extremely loyal though somewhat clumsy at times, as well as a little silly. In chapter 92, he is offered a marriage proposal by Kiki, which he declines.\n;{{nihongo|Kiki Seiran|\u6728\u3005\u30fb\u30bb\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Nazuka]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Kiki is one of Zen's closest aides, and arrives at the castle some time after Mitsuhide. As the heir to the household of the Seiran family, her father expects her to return home to assume responsibility after her time serving Zen. Reserved, independent and intelligent, Kiki is extremely loyal to protecting Zen (and later Shirayuki as she becomes part of Zen's life) and is most often seen with Mitsuhide. She has stated (to Zen) that when the time comes, she will propose to Mitsuhide. Like Mitsuhide, she is skilled at swordplay and is often seen training the soldiers or dueling with him. In chapter 92, Kiki confesses and proposes to Mitsuhide, which he later declines.\n;{{nihongo|Obi|\u30aa\u30d3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Austin Tindle]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:Obi is one of Zen's self-proclaimed aides. Originally sent by Marquis Haruka as a way to scare Shirayuki out of the castle, he later pledges himself to Zen after being discovered. It is hinted that he has feelings for Shirayuki, but his loyalty to both Zen and Shirayuki prevents him from acting out on his feelings. Obi has a relatively mysterious past as a loner, but finds himself drawn to protecting Zen, Shirayuki, and their respective goals. He later becomes Zen's official messenger. With his quick movements and reflexes, he is often sent by Zen to protect Shirayuki at times when he cannot leave his royal duties.

This makes trouble for her when she is chosen by the snooty Prince Raji Shenazard to be his concubine (a mistress), and instead of agreeing, flees to the neighbouring city of Clarines by hitching a ride on a carriage. She also cuts her long red hair, leaving it behind still with a ribbon tied to it, as her clear refusal to obey the prince. Once in Clarines, tired and hungry from her journey, she calls at a house but no one answers, so she sleeps outside until the next morning, when she meets Zen Wistalia and his companions Mitsuhide Lowen and Kiki Seiran. Zen offers her shelter in the house, while making her confess the reason why she escaped. When a basket of apples arrives for Shirayuki, with her hair in the ribbon tied to the handle, Zen bites into one and collapses. At that point a soldier from Tanbarun appears, he confirms that the apples were poisoned by Raji who holds the antidote, which he will hand over to Zen only if Shirayuki becomes his concubine. Shirayuki is brought to the royal palace of Tanbarun where she meets a smug Raji. After bravely agreeing to his proposal in exchange for Zen's antidote, Zen suddenly appears to defend her, revealing his resistance to poisons. He also introduces himself to Prince Raji as the second prince of Clarines, which means that their countries could end up going to war if he disclosed that Prince Raj's attempted to poison him. Afraid that he would be disgraced, Prince Raji has no choice but to give up on Shirayuki and allow her to leave with Zen. She decides to follow him to his land.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Following the Sound of Your Heart\n| AltTitle        = Tadoru wa Mune no Naru H\u014d e\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u8fbf\u308b\u306f\u80f8\u306e\u9cf4\u308b\u307b\u3046\u3078}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = Back in Clarines, Shirayuki treats Zen with herbs, and the following day she looks for a job as a herbalist in the city. Instead, she gets a suggestion to prepare for the exam for court herbalist apprentice. Feeling that this is her path, she travels to an island accompanied by Zen, to study and gather rare herbs. While in the island's forest she is captured by a man named Mihaya who has his eye on her red hair. In her cell Shirayuki takes advantage of the night to rub the ropes that tie her wrists against the rough wall, so that when her captor comes to leave food she can free herself, trapping Mihaya in his own cell. However, he manages to escape and corners her. She then places paralysing herbs in her oil lantern and smashes it against the wall to release their paralyzing fumes. She jumps out of a window onto a branch and falls to the ground. During her captivity Zen starts worrying about Shirayuki when he visits her place and is told by her landlady that she has not come back yet. Unfortunately, the paralysing gas only has a temporary effect on Mihaya so he is able to catches up with Shirayuki. Zen rescues her at the last minute, and hands Mihaya over to the royal guards. Mihaya claims that the reason for capturing Shirayuka is to parade her to elevate his status, since his family used to be wealthy but he is now penniless and in hiding.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Shining Time of Promise\n| AltTitle        = Yakusoku, Kagayaku Sonotoki ni\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u7d04\u675f\u3001\u8f1d\u304f\u305d\u306e\u6642\u306b}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Due to her closeness with Zen, Shirayuki is now a regular visitor to his castle with no restrictions.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

[[Tony Soprano|Tony]] goes there and asks Johnny insistently why he didn't tell him about it. Johnny says they moved there for family reasons.

When Janice refuses, one of them hits her hard. She takes them to the luggage locker where she has put it and hands it over. Tony visits her in the hospital, exasperated with her again; he will have to retaliate against the men who roughed up his sister. Janice says she has hit bottom but feels born again in the Lord: \"I give myself up utterly and totally to God.\"\n\n[[Ralphie Cifaretto|Ralphie]], who is now dating [[Rosalie Aprile|Rosalie]], takes [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie, Jr.]] with him when he visits one of the companies he extorts money from. Ralphie has no dispute with the man there but provokes a fight. The man takes out a baseball bat, which they get away from him. Ralphie holds him and urges Jackie to hit him. Jackie eagerly beats and kicks him. Ralphie empties the man's wallet, giving some of the bills to Jackie, who is gloating. Partly because of this incident, Tony makes [[Gigi Cestone|Gigi]] a captain, not Ralphie, to his deep disappointment. \n\n[[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] and her husband [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Richard LaPenna|Richard]] are now reconciled. Both he and [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Dr. Elliot Kupferberg|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg]] are urging her to cease treating her gangster patient, whose name she inadvertently reveals to Kupferberg. She has her own doubts: \"I've been charmed by a sociopath,\" she says. She believes it is now time for him to be treated by a behavior modification therapist, but Tony is reluctant to talk to anyone else.\n\nIn the underground garage one evening after work, Dr. Melfi is attacked and raped.  The police quickly find the man.  Richard and her son [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Jason LaPenna|Jason]] are enraged, especially when they are informed that, because of a procedural error, the police have had to release the rapist. Melfi herself feels a crazed desire for revenge and knows that a word to Tony Soprano would obtain it, but, like her husband, she will obey the social compact.\n\nLater, Dr. Melfi has a dream. She buys a soda from a vending machine; when she reaches into the machine to get it, her hand is trapped inside. A [[Rottweiler]] appears and terrifies her. Then the rapist advances towards her. The dog turns and mauls the rapist, who cries in agony. With Kupferberg, she understands the meaning: the dog is Tony Soprano taking revenge on her behalf.\n\nShe tells Tony and others she has been in a car accident. When he sees her, Tony is shocked and concerned by her injuries. He tells her he is now ready to see a behaviorist. She says, \"No,\" and starts crying. He goes to her, lays his hands gently on her, and asks what is the matter. She composes herself and asks him to return to his seat. He goes back, but asks, \"What?

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1474/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid-19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials.
