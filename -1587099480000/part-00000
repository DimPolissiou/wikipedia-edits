Written and directed by series creator [[Sam Esmail]], it aired on November 17, 2019, on [[USA Network]].\n\nIn the episode, Elliot Alderson ([[Rami Malek]]) and his therapist Krista Gordon ([[Gloria Reuben]]) are held hostage by Fernando Vera ([[Elliot Villar]]), who attempts to coerce Elliot into working alongside him by understanding Mr. Robot. \n\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with many naming it as one of the best of the entire series. Particular praise was directed at Malek{{r|AV Club rev}} and Villar's{{r|NYT-rev}} performances, as well as Esmail's direction and writing. For the episode, Esmail received a nomination for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama|Best Episodic Drama]] at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2019|72nd Writers Guild of America Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Plot|episode|date=December 2019}}\nFollowing the events of [[List of Mr. Robot episodes#ep38|the previous episode]], Elliot is kidnapped by Vera and his associates Peanut and Javi. He is removed from the boot of a car and then tied to a chair in a room adjacent to Krista, who is also being held hostage.\n\nVera recounts his life after the events of \"[[List of Mr. Robot episodes#ep6|eps1.5_br4ve-trave1er.asf]]\", having returned to the [[Dominican Republic]]. He describes his journey from street hustling to taking control of the country as well as [[Haiti]] in 87 days. On day 88 however, his inscrutable feelings of emptiness are vindicated by a [[Shamanism|shaman]] who tells him he must return home. Realizing his desire to return to New York to reconcile with Elliot, he states his plan to take over New York with Elliot as his business partner. Elliot, remembering Shayla's death at Vera's hands, refuses to cooperate without Krista's safety guaranteed. \n\nElliot is brought to Krista and shown that she is safe. Vera reveals his knowledge of Mr. Robot, having extracted it from Krista, and declares his desire to meet him. Mr. Robot takes control after Krista is threatened. He points out flaws in Vera's plan, but offers to help if Krista is let go. Vera protests the suggestion, stating that Krista's captivity guarantees Elliot's cooperation. Elliot offers Vera the money from the Cyprus Bank hack he is planning.\n\nVera and his crew view the hack's details on a laptop. Seeing they are distracted, Elliot grabs for a gun in his bag. He threatens to shoot Vera and pulls the trigger, but realizes that the gun had already been unloaded. Angered, Vera threatens to shoot Krista, until Elliot admits that he needs her. Vera, comparing her to the shaman that had helped him, decides to change his approach.\n\nVera forces Krista and Elliot into an impromptu therapy session to discover more about Mr. Robot. Krista protests, saying it will not work without a controlled and private environment. Vera orders his associates to leave. Krista, still not satisfied, acquiesces after convincing from Elliot. Growing impatient with the discussion of Elliot's mother, Vera demands they discuss the origins of Mr. Robot's existence. Elliot begins to feel that a secret is being kept from him. Frustrated by Mr. Robot and Krista's attempts at diverting the subject matter, he encourages Vera to read from Krista's files. The window event from his childhood is brought up as a moment of significance. Elliot's version of events, that he swung a bat at his father and then jumped out of a window in a state of mania, is called into question after Krista points out Elliot's reliance on Darlene's memories and not his own. Krista compares his poor memory of the day to his inability to remember moments where Mr. Robot takes control. Elliot realizes Mr. Robot took control that day, having existed for longer than he had thought. Krista questions Mr. Robot's purpose, and puts together the pieces that Elliot needed protecting, specifically from his father. He finally remembers that he was sexually abused by his father as a child as he breaks down.\n\nUnable to come to terms with his abuse, Elliot is consoled by Vera. Elliot blames Vera for the revelation. Vera then reveals his own past with sexual abuse, from friends of his mother. Vera says people with their trauma should not struggle alone, and confides his philosophy that people like them become unstoppable. After Vera assures Elliot that he isn't alone anymore, Krista, sneaking up, stabs Vera in the back. Vera dies from his wounds, as Elliot and Krista escape.\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode is presented in a five-act structure which critics compared to resembling the structure of a [[Play (theatre)|play]],{{r|IBT}} emphasized by its reliance on dramatic audio cues and usage of two adjacent sets.

Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

It is an evolution of the [[Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, with modernization mostly concentrated on the communications and navigation subsystems.\n\nIt is used by the [[Roscosmos]] for [[human spaceflight]]. Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

The span began life in 1905 as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]: Only one other was ever constructed in the country, [[Sky Ride]] in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348|title=Strange Span: 1907|website=Shorpy.com}}</ref> The span was converted in 1929\u20131930 to a [[vertical-lift bridge]]&nbsp;\u2014 also rather uncommon, although there are six such bridges along Ontario's [[Welland Canal]]&nbsp;\u2014 and continues to operate today. The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 22, 1973. The bridge is owned and operated by the City of Duluth. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains a nearby maritime museum.\n\n== Bridge history ==\n[[File:Aerial bridge car, Duluth, Minn. c1908.jpg|thumb|Aerial gondola, circa 1908]]The bridge spans the [[Duluth Ship Canal]], which was put through the miles-long [[Spit (landform)|sand spit]] named [[Minnesota Point]]&nbsp;\u2014 commonly called Park Point by locals&nbsp;\u2014 in 1870\u20131871. The natural mouth of the [[Saint Louis River]] is about {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} farther southeast, and is split between [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Creating this gap in the sand spit  meant that residents who lived on the new [[island]] needed to have a way to get across. Several transportation methods were tried, though they were complicated by the weather.  [[Ferry|Ferries]] could work in the summer, but ice caused problems in colder months. A swinging [[footbridge]] was used, but was considered rather rickety and unsafe.\n\nIn 1892, a contest was held to find a solution. The winning design came from John Low Waddell, who drew up plans for a high-rise vertical lift bridge. The city of Duluth was eager to build the bridge, which would have been about {{convert|130|ft|m}} wide. However, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] objected to the design, and the project was canceled before it could be built.

The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 22, 1973. The bridge is owned and operated by the City of Duluth. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains a nearby maritime museum.\n\n== Bridge history ==\n[[File:Aerial bridge car, Duluth, Minn. c1908.jpg|thumb|Aerial gondola, circa 1908]]The bridge spans the [[Duluth Ship Canal]], which was put through the miles-long [[Spit (landform)|sand spit]] named [[Minnesota Point]]&nbsp;\u2014 commonly called Park Point by locals&nbsp;\u2014 in 1870\u20131871. The natural mouth of the [[Saint Louis River]] is about {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} farther southeast, and is split between [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Creating this gap in the sand spit  meant that residents who lived on the new [[island]] needed to have a way to get across. Several transportation methods were tried, though they were complicated by the weather.  [[Ferry|Ferries]] could work in the summer, but ice caused problems in colder months. A swinging [[footbridge]] was used, but was considered rather rickety and unsafe.\n\nIn 1892, a contest was held to find a solution. The winning design came from John Low Waddell, who drew up plans for a high-rise vertical lift bridge. The city of Duluth was eager to build the bridge, which would have been about {{convert|130|ft|m}} wide. However, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] objected to the design, and the project was canceled before it could be built. Waddell's design went on to be built in [[Chicago, Illinois]], as the slightly larger South Halsted Street Bridge, which was removed in 1932.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10791.html Encyclopedia of Chicago: ''Halsted Street Vertical Lift Bridge, 1894-1932''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623001715/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10791.html |date=June 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"mhs\">[http://www.mnhs.org/places/nationalregister/bridges/nrwasb/sign.html Minnesota Historical Society, ''Minnesota's Historic Bridges:Stillwater Bridge'', 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216121453/http://www.mnhs.org/places/nationalregister/bridges/nrwasb/sign.html |date=December 16, 2004 }} - includes Duluth, Chicago detail</ref><ref>Leonardo Fern\u00e1ndez Troyano, ''Bridge engineering: a global perspective''.

Appearing in all four ''Toy Story'' films, he usually acts as the leader of Andy's toy group. His rivalry with Buzz forms the basis of the first film's plot. In ''Toy Story 2'', he is stolen at a yard sale by a toy collector named [[#Al McWhiggin|Al]], causing the other toys to embark on a rescue mission.

In ''Toy Story'', he begins the series believing he is a real Space Ranger (the other toys are aware that they are toys) and develops a rivalry with Woody, who resents him for getting more attention as the newcomer. His catchphrase is \"To Infinity and Beyond!\". During the film, he comes to realize that he is just a toy, and eventually becomes good friends with Woody. He is extremely loyal to his friends. In ''Toy Story 2'', Buzz\u2014with Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and Slinky\u2014goes to save Woody from Al, where he gets stuck in the Buzz Lightyear aisle in [[#Al McWhiggin|Al's Toy Barn]] by another Buzz and finds out for himself what he was really like.

Slinky's head, feet, and tail are plastic; he has a green collar. Slinky Dog was partially redesigned for the film by Pixar artist [[Bud Luckey]] to make him more appealing as an animated character. In the opening scenes of the first and third films, Slinky is described by Andy as One-Eyed Bart's \"attack dog with a built-in [[force field (fiction)|force field]]\".\n\nSlinky Dog appears in ''Toy Story'' and ''Toy Story 2'', voiced by Jim Varney. In ''Toy Story 3'', Slinky was re-cast due to Varney's death, and has been voiced by Blake Clark ever since. His catchphrase, said in all four films, is \"Golly bob-howdy!\".\n\nSlinky reappears in the short film ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'', in which he acts as a hotel porter as part of [[#Ken|Ken]] and [[#Barbie|Barbie]]'s Hawaiian adventures. He also appears in ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'' and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]''. He does not speak in ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'', silently appearing along with Jessie in one scene.\n\nA ride, [[Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin]], opened at several Disney theme parks beginning in 2010. [[Slinky Dog Dash]], a [[steel roller coaster]] themed to Slinky Dog, opened at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] at [[Walt Disney World Resort]], on June 30, 2018.\n\n====Rex====\nVoiced by:\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] (primary voice actor)\n* [[Earl Boen]] (''Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue'')\n\nRex is an excitable large, green, plastic ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. Rex suffers from anxiety, an [[inferiority complex]] and the concern that he is not scary enough. Although Rex is a toy dinosaur, he dislikes confrontation and is sensitive in nature. He is among the largest of Andy's toys. In the opening scenes of the first and third films, he is described by Andy as Woody's \"dinosaur who eats [[force field (fiction)|force field]] dogs\", in reference to Slinky Dog. Rex is voiced by [[Earl Boen]] (credited as \"Earl Bowen\") in the video game ''[[Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite video game |title=Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue |developer=Traveller's Tales |publisher=Activision |date=1999 |platform=Nintendo 64 |scene=End credits }}</ref>\n\nRex appears in each of the ''Toy Story'' movies.

He and Mr. Potato Head are friends, and are seen in the first film playing a card game, and later [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]], which Hamm always wins. Out of all the toys, he is shown to have the most knowledge of the outside, often being familiar with various gadgets that are shown. In the second and third films, Andy describes Hamm as Evil Dr. Pork Chop. In the third film, Evil Dr. Pork Chop has a giant pig-shaped aircraft, which he uses to rescue One-Eyed Bart and One-Eyed Betty (the Potato Heads).\n\nHamm appears in each of the ''Toy Story'' movies. He appears in the post-credit scene of ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as part of a homage and self-parody to Ratzenberger (who voices the [[Mack (Cars)|Mack Super-Liner]] in the film). Hamm also briefly appears in ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins'', voiced by Andrew Stanton. In a 2010 television advertisement for the [[United States Postal Service]] promoting ''Toy Story 3,'' Hamm wears a postal worker's outfit while promoting the Priority Mail service; Ratzenberger is best known for his role as mailman [[Cliff Clavin]] on the long-running sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |title=Postal Service, 'Toy Story 3' team up |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/06/postal_service_toy_story_3_tea.html |accessdate=February 19, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=June 9, 2010}}</ref> Hamm also makes an appearance in ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'' as the mayor in Toy Box mode.

In the first film, it sketches a [[hangman's knot|hangman's noose]] and shows it to Woody after the toys revolt against him for knocking Buzz out of a window. In the second film, it helps the other toys by initially sketching portraits of Woody's kidnapper and later sketching a map showing the location of Al's Toy Barn. It appears in ''Toy Story 3'' only through footage of Andy as a young boy. It is stated by Woody that Etch was among other toys of Andy's who went on to new owners.\n* Lenny (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Services Set for Story Genius Joe Ranft |url=https://www.awn.com/news/services-set-story-genius-joe-ranft |website=Animation World Network |accessdate=February 7, 2019 |date=August 19, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cody |first=Bill |title=John Lasseter Talks 'Cars 2' and the Memory of His Friend and Collaborator, Joe Ranft |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/553767-pixar-head-john-lasseter-remembers-good-pal-late-great-joe-ranft |website=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=February 7, 2019 |date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> \u2013 A pair of wind up [[binoculars]] used by the other toys to get a better view during various situations in the first two films. He does not speak in ''Toy Story 2'', unlike the first film. He is a playable character in the ''Toy Story Racer'' video game. He also appears in ''Toy Story 3'' through home video footage from when Andy was young.\n* The [[Magic 8-Ball]] makes brief appearances in the first three films. In the first film, Woody asked the ball if Andy would pick him instead of Buzz Lightyear to take along with him to Pizza Planet, but the ball's reply was \"Don't Count On It\", making Woody upset. Woody shoves the ball away, and it falls behind a desk. The ball is donated to Sunnyside daycare in the third film.\n* Mr. Mike \u2013 A toy [[tape recorder]] who helped Woody amplify his voice during a toy meeting with his attached microphone. At the end of ''Toy Story 2'', Wheezy uses him as a karaoke machine.\n* Mr. Shark \u2013 A blue squeak-toy [[shark]] who appears in the first two films. In the first film, he steals Woody's hat and imitates him before Woody takes his hat back. In ''Toy Story 2'', he is used as one of the death traps during Andy's playtime. At the end of the film, he repairs Wheezy by finding him an extra squeaker.\n* {{visible anchor|Mr. Spell}} \u2013 A toy with a built-in keyboard who speaks words that are typed in. He makes brief appearances in the first two films, and it is stated that he has held toy [[seminar]]s on topics such as \"plastic corrosion awareness\" and \"what to do if you or part of you is swallowed.\" In ''Toy Story 2'', Buzz uses him to help figure out the identity of the man who stole Woody from the yard sale. He does not appear in ''Toy Story 3''.\n* Robot \u2013 A robot toy. In ''Toy Story'', he stands on his head for Buzz to run on his treads like a treadmill. In ''Toy Story 2'', he assists Buzz in making sure all of Andy's toys are accounted for once they learn of a yard sale. He is not seen again until the end of the film when he watches Wheezy sing \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". He only appears in ''Toy Story 3'' through old home videos near the beginning of the film.\n* Snake \u2013 A green and purple [[snake]] toy who communicates through hissing. It has brief appearances in the first two films, and only appears at the beginning of ''Toy Story 3'' through old home videos.\n* Troikas \u2013 A set of five non-talking egg-shaped toys that appear in ''Toy Story'' and ''Toy Story 2''.

It briefly appears in ''Toy Story 3'' through old home videos of Andy as a child. A group of Troll dolls also appears in the third film's opening sequence, in which they are portrayed as orphans on a runaway train during Andy's playtime.\n* [[Barrel of Monkeys]] \u2013 A barrel used to contain red monkeys, whose arms connect to each other. In a brief appearance, the monkeys are lowered by Andy's other toys out of the bedroom window in an attempt to retrieve Buzz, but the plan fails as there are not enough monkeys. They make brief appearances in the next two films during Andy's playtime. A Barrel of Monkeys is also briefly featured as one of [[#Bonnie|Bonnie]]'s toys in the short film ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]''.\n\n===Davis family===\n====Andy Davis====\nVoiced by:\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] (all four films)\n* Charlie Bright (young Andy in ''Toy Story 3'')\n* Jack McGraw (young Andy in ''Toy Story 4'')<ref>{{cite web |last=Cooley |first=Josh |authorlink=Josh Cooley |title=I'd be crying too, Maddy and Jack are incredible actors. |url=https://twitter.com/CooleyUrFaceOff/status/1132124488659718144 |website=Twitter |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAndy Davis is the owner of [[Sheriff Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear]] and the other toys in the first three films. He lives with his mother and younger sister Molly until the third film, when he goes to [[college]] after turning 17. His father is never seen or mentioned in any of the films, leaving any whereabouts of him unknown. In ''Toy Story 2'', Andy's mother calls Woody \"an old family toy\" and [[#Stinky Pete the Prospector|Prospector]] calls him a [[hand-me-down]] toy. [[John Lasseter]] said \"we always thought\" that Woody was \"kind of a hand-me-down\" to Andy from his father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woody |url=https://video.disney.com/watch/woody-4bb39ea6cd55da8833003b15 |website=Disney Video |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Toy Story'' producer [[Ralph Guggenheim]] in a December 1995 ''[[Animation Magazine]]'' article, John Lasseter and the story team for ''Toy Story'' reviewed the names of Pixar employees' children, looking for the right name for Woody's owner. Davis was ultimately named after and based on [[Andy Luckey]], the son of animator [[Bud Luckey]], Pixar's fifth employee and the creator of Woody.{{citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=Needs article title/author/page number.}}\n\nThe physical appearance of Andy differs slightly between each of the films due to advances in animation technology.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rees |first=Arianna |title='Toy Story' fans are losing it over Andy's appearance in the 'Toy Story 4' trailer.

In the first film, she has brown hair and she ties it into a ponytail. In the other two films, her physical appearance is noticeably different and instead of brown, she has blonde hair and leaves it down. Mrs. Davis is presented as a loving mother to Andy and Molly, but is a major (though indirect) threat to the toys. Mrs. Davis' actions regarding the toys sets the plot in motion in all three films, though they are not malicious. In the first film, she purchases a Buzz Lightyear toy for Andy on his birthday, prompting the rivalry between Buzz and Woody which leads to them being lost and forced to find their way home. In the second film, she puts Wheezy up for sale at a yard sale, prompting Woody's rescue attempt where he is subsequently stolen by Al. In the third film, she tells Andy to clean out his room before going to college and mistakenly throws away the toys Andy planned to put in the attic. Despite this, in the second film, she is very protective of Woody, describing him as an old family toy. At the end of the third film, she breaks down and weeps at the departure of her son, but Andy reassures her that she will always be with him even if they are apart. This moment between mother and son plays a major factor in Woody deciding to have Andy donate his toys to Bonnie, thus giving them a new lease on their lives.\n\nIn 2014, [[blogger]] Jon Negroni theorized that Mrs. Davis is [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]'s original owner, [[#Emily|Emily]], based on the flashback sequence of Jessie and Emily from ''Toy Story 2''. The sequence shows Emily as a child in the 1960s, which is when Mrs. Davis would have been a child. The sequence also shows that the cowboy hat that Emily had is very similar to Andy's hat but with an additional white lace area, and Emily's hair was brown, just like Mrs. Davis's hair in the first film. However while sharing the same colour, the hats are in fact different shapes reflecting the hats worn by their favourite toy (Andy's being a teardrop shape like Woody's and Emily's being circular like Jessie's).<ref name=Hernandez>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|url=http://kotaku.com/a-bonkers-theory-on-the-true-identity-of-andys-mom-in-1530187231|title=A Bonkers Theory on The True Identity of Andy's Mom In ''Toy Story''|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Negroni>{{cite web|last=Negroni|first=Jon|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/02/24/toy-story-the-true-identity-of-andy-s-mom-makes-the-movie-more-epic-1247874|title=Toy Story: The True Identity of Andy's Mom Makes The Movie More Epic|publisher=[[Moviepilot]]|date=February 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609161342/https://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/02/24/toy-story-the-true-identity-of-andy-s-mom-makes-the-movie-more-epic-1247874|archivedate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Molly Davis====\nVoiced by:\n* Hannah Unkrich (''Toy Story 2'' and archived footage in ''Toy Story 3'')\n* [[Bea Miller]] (''Toy Story 3'')\n* Uncredited actress (''Toy Story 4'')\n\nMolly Davis is Andy's younger sister, seen as an infant in the first film, a toddler in the second film, and as a preteen in the third film. Andy uses her crib as a town jail during playtime at the beginning of the first film, showing they share a room. When the family moves later in the film, Andy and Molly get separate rooms, though Molly has plans to move into Andy's room once he leaves for college. In the first film, she slobbers on Mr. Potato Head and throws him from the crib, causing his parts to scatter and earning her the nickname \"Princess Drool\" from him. At the end of the film, she receives a [[#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]] toy for Christmas. In ''Toy Story 3'', she also owned [[#Barbie|a Barbie doll]], which she donates to the daycare center as she was less interested in dolls and toys by that time.\n\nIn ''Toy Story 2'', young Molly was voiced by co-director [[Lee Unkrich]]'s daughter, Hannah Unkrich.

Sid is known for torturing and destroying toys. Many of his toys are either destroyed, have missing pieces, or replaced with parts from other toys. He is also shown tormenting his sister, Hannah, and destroying her toys, such as by blowing them up, burning them or decapitating them. He also enjoys [[skateboard]]ing, and his shirt depicts a skull that would later be used as the logo for [[Zero Skateboards]]. The toys mention that he was consistently kicked out of summer camp; and in the audio commentary on the tenth anniversary DVD, the directors mention that he is a bully but also the \"most creative character in the movie\". His parents do not make any major appearances: his mother's voice is only heard briefly several times in the film, and his father is only seen briefly asleep on a chair in front of a TV.\n\nHe is the only human in the films to observe toys actually coming to life, when near the end of the first film, Woody and Sid's mutant toys decide to rescue Buzz by scaring Sid, which causes him to become frightened of toys. The last straw is Woody coming alive while Sid is holding him and telling him to \"play nice\". This causes Sid to panic and run back into his house screaming, and then to his room when his sister scares him with her new toy doll, Sally.\n\nSid does not appear in the second film, although he is mentioned by Buzz during the toys' mission to rescue Woody from the toy collector Al McWhiggin. Sid also appears in the four-issue ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' comic mini-series produced by [[Boom! Comics]].\n\nIn the third film, Sid (now an adult) makes brief appearances in two scenes once again voiced by Erik von Detten. He is shown to be a bearded garbageman recognizable by his characteristic skull T-shirt. His only dialogue in this movie involves humming guitar riffs, and he is depicted listening to [[heavy metal music]] through a pair of large headphones.\n\n====Hannah Phillips====\nVoiced by [[Sarah Freeman (actress)|Sarah Freeman]]\n\nHannah Phillips is Sid's sweet-natured, younger sister who appears a few times in the film. Hannah has adjusted to her toys being [[mutilate]]d by Sid. Most of her dolls either have different heads or altered body parts, and at the end of the film she finds enjoyment in scaring her brother after he has been horrified by Woody and the other toys. She spends most of the time during the movie playing with her altered dolls.\n\n====Sid and Hannah's toys====\nThe following toys belong to Sid and Hannah.\n\nHannah has several dolls, although some have been beheaded by Sid. During the film, one of Hannah's [[rag doll]]s, Janie, is taken by Sid, who switches her head with that of a toy [[Pteranodon]]. Hannah also has a rag doll named Sally.\n\nSid has various mutant toys who are assembled by him from mixed pieces of several toys that belong to him and Hannah. Sid's mutant toys do not speak, but they understand [[Morse code]]. Buzz and Woody initially think that they are [[cannibal]]s who are going to eat them, before they learn that the toys are actually friendly and compassionate. They fix Buzz's broken arm, Janie and the Pteranodon, and also help Woody implement his plan to save Buzz from Sid. They surround Sid as Woody tells him how much they hate being mutilated, and they all rejoice in victory after Woody frightens Sid away with his own voice. After Sid is scared by his toys, he sees Sally (Hannah's new doll and a replacement for Janie), then runs off in fright, thinking that Sally will come to life. Sid's mutant toys include:\n\n* Babyface<ref name=TSRacer/> &nbsp;\u2013 A one-eyed baby doll head staked on top of a [[spider]]-like body with [[crab]]-like pincers made of [[Erector Set]] pieces. Babyface is shown communicating with the other toys by banging in Morse code on the side of Sid's metal bedpost with his big claw. This method is used when he signals the other mutant toys to gather around to listen to Woody as he formulates his plan to rescue Buzz from Sid. When the mutant toys surround Sid, Babyface, suspended by Legs, lands on Sid's head, scaring him. Babyface appears in ''[[Toy Story Treats]]'', and is a playable character in the 2001 video game ''[[Toy Story Racer]]''.<ref name=TSRacer/> In 2010, Disney released a remote-controlled Babyface toy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Cool Stuff: Babyface Toy Story Remote Control Toy |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-babyface-toy-story-remote-control-toy/ |website=/Film |accessdate=February 12, 2019 |date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>\n* Legs&nbsp;\u2013 A toy [[fishing rod]] with doll legs. When Woody formulates his plan to save Buzz from Sid, he assigns Legs to partner up with Ducky. Legs opens the vent grating so she and Ducky can go to the front porch, where Legs lowers Ducky through the hole Ducky created so Ducky can swing toward the doorbell. After Ducky catches the Frog, Legs pulls both toys up to safety. Later, when the mutant toys advance on Sid, Legs lowers Babyface onto Sid's head, scaring him. Legs also appears in ''Toy Story Treats''.\n* A [[jack-in-the-box]] toy with a green arm that pops out. During Woody's plan to save Buzz from Sid, the toy extends its hand to Sid's doorknob, ready to open the door when the signal comes. The hand later grabs Sid's leg when the mutant toys surround him. The toy also appears in ''Toy Story Treats''.\n* Roller Bob&nbsp;\u2013 A [[jet plane|jet pilot]] action figure, whose torso has been attached to a [[skateboard]]. After the Frog is let out of Sid's room to distract Scud, Roller Bob ferries Woody and the other mutant toys outside the house to Sid's yard.\n* Rock Mobile<ref name=TSgame/>&nbsp;\u2013 The head of a toy insect attached on top of a small, headless human torso toy who is holding a steering wheel. This torso is attached in the head socket of a larger, muscular human torso toy that is missing its legs. \n* Frog&nbsp;\u2013 A tin wind-up [[frog]] with two different wheels instead of back legs. The Frog is also missing its left front foot. As part of Woody's plot to rescue Buzz from Sid, Woody orders, \"Wind the Frog!\", at which point the frog is wound up. When Ducky rings the doorbell, the Frog is let out of Sid's room, allowing Scud to chase him down the stairs and out to the front porch, where he is caught by Ducky; Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n* Ducky&nbsp;\u2013 A [[duck]]-headed [[Pez]] dispenser with a baby doll torso and plunger base. He and Legs go to the front porch via the vent, and Ducky, suspended from the porch ceiling by Legs, swings toward the doorbell until he finally activates it, giving Woody the signal to release the Frog. Ducky catches the Frog as Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n\nAdditionally, Sid has a non-mutant soldier toy called {{Visible anchor|Combat Carl}}, who is blown up by Sid with an [[M-80 (explosive)|explosive device]]. Combat Carl is Caucasian; a [[#Combat Carl 2|different character with the same name]], who is African-American, appears in ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''\n\nDuring the scene where Woody is telling Sid to play nice, other toys can be seen. these include a burnt rag doll, a pickup truck, 2 toy soldiers covered in mud and the alien that was chewed up by Scud.\n\n====Scud====\nScud is Sid's aggressive [[Bull Terrier]] who enjoys helping his owner torture toys for fun by chewing them up to break every part for him. His viciousness is first demonstrated when Sid sets a squeeze toy Alien on his nose and commands him to maul it mercilessly. Scud is an obstacle for Woody and Buzz as they try to escape Sid's house. Later, Scud prevents Woody and Buzz from trying to reach the moving van to reunite with Andy, since he didn\u2019t know that Sid was scared when the toys came alive. Scud chases the toys, but they escape when Scud chases them into the middle of a traffic intersection, where he is trapped by the cars as they crash while trying to avoid him.\n\n===Aliens / Little Green Men===\nVoiced by:\n*[[Jeff Pidgeon]] (primary voice actor)\n*[[Patrick Warburton]] (''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'')\n\n[[File:Anniversery of the making of Toy Story (26419290611).jpg|thumb|right|Models of the Alien characters]]\nThe Aliens, also known as [[Little green men|Little Green Men]] in the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' television series, are a series of green, three-eyed [[squeaky toy]] aliens. They appear in all three films. In ''Toy Story 2'', three aliens become part of Andy's toy collection and are adopted by [[#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]] and [[#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]]. In the third film, Mr. Potato Head refers to them as \"my boys\", implying that all three are male.\n\nIn ''Toy Story'', Buzz and Woody climb inside a giant rocket-shaped [[Claw crane|claw game]] at Pizza Planet. Inside the claw game are hundreds of squeeze toy aliens. When Buzz asks who is in charge, the Aliens say \"the claw\", which belongs in the machine, they say that the claw \"chooses who will go and who will stay\". Sid spots Buzz inside the claw game and tries to win him. Woody attempts to save Buzz and escape through the claw game's maintenance hatch, but the Aliens stop him and say that they must not fight the claw. Woody, Buzz, and an Alien get taken to Sid's house. Sid gives the Alien to his dog, Scud, who violently chews it as Woody and Buzz watch in horror. Near the end of the movie, the same Alien, now damaged, walks like a zombie toward Sid, part of Woody's plan to scare him.\n\nIn ''Toy Story 2'', a trio of aliens are hanging above the dashboard in the Pizza Planet truck. Buzz groans when he sees them, remembering them from the claw game in the first film. When the toys are having trouble getting the truck to move, the aliens tell Mr. Potato Head to \"use the wand of power\", referring to the truck's gear lever. They nearly fall out of the window, due to the sharp turns from Buzz trying to catch Al in his car. Mr. Potato Head saves the aliens, and they are thankful to him. Throughout the rest of the movie, they frequently say \"You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful,\" much to Potato Head's dismay. The Aliens join the quest to save Woody and mistake the entrance to the baggage area for the \"Mystic Portal\". Back home, the trio, along with Bullseye and Jessie, end up becoming some of Andy's toys. They say their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head, and Mrs. Potato Head is so happy that he saved their lives, she decides they should adopt them, with the Aliens calling Mr. Potato Head \"Daddy\".\n\nIn the opening sequence of ''Toy Story 3'', the Aliens are portrayed by Andy as the henchmen under One-Eyed Bart and One-Eyed Betty (the Potato Heads), serving as the getaway drivers in a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. In the present time, the trio continues to express their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head. They are later donated to Sunnyside along with the rest of Andy's toys. In Sunnyside, the Aliens find a toy crane, which reminds them of the claw game in Pizza Planet. The Aliens get sat on and bounced on during a rough playtime with the toddlers. The toys plan to escape Sunnyside. The Aliens have to go through the playground with Woody and ride on Bullseye. They almost get caught by Big Baby because one of the Aliens falls off Bullseye and squeaks, but manage to hide inside a pail. Later when Andy's toys escape, one of the Alien's feet gets stuck in the lid of a dumpster. After Woody rescues the Alien, Lotso, who had been thrown into the bin by Big Baby, grabs Woody's feet and pulls him into the bin just as the garbage truck arrives. The toys fall into the truck, which transports them to a landfill. The Aliens are separated from the others by a bulldozer when they wander off, having spotted a crane. They are later revealed to be in control of a giant claw crane, which they used to rescue the other toys from an incinerator. Mr. Potato Head finally acknowledges them as his children, reciting their repetitive line, \"You have saved our lives and we are eternally grateful.\" The trio are later donated to Bonnie along with Andy's other toys.\n\nThe Aliens reappear in the theatrical short films ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]],'' ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'' and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', and the 2019 video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''. The Aliens also have a ride at Disney theme parks called [[Alien Swirling Saucers]].\n\n==Introduced in ''Toy Story 2'' (1999)==\n===''Woody's Roundup'' gang===\n====Jessie====\n{{Main|Jessie (Toy Story)}}\nVoiced by [[Joan Cusack]]\n\n[[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] is a cowgirl doll, and part of the ''Woody's Roundup'' gang. In ''Toy Story 2'', Jessie is initially hesitant to join Woody to become one of Andy's toys. After she becomes part of the family, she is very happy. In ''Toy Story 3'', she believes Andy threw her and the other toys out; she argues with Woody, who says Andy was actually putting them in the attic. Later in the film, Jessie becomes close with Buzz, especially when he is in Spanish mode. At the end, they dance to the Spanish version of \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]].\" Jessie also appears in Pixar's 2013 television special ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' as the main character that saves the other toys from the toy stealer and seller at the rest stop.\n\n====Bullseye====\nBullseye is a toy [[horse]] and is part of the ''Woody's Roundup'' collection. In the fictional ''Woody's Roundup'' television series, Bullseye is portrayed as Woody's horse. In ''Toy Story 2'', he was very happy to finally see Woody after a long time in storage. Bullseye is shown to loathe fights as he hides in a can when Jessie jumps on Woody. He is also upset at Woody's intention to abandon the ''Roundup'' gang to return to Andy. When Woody decides to return to Andy's room, it is Bullseye's loyalty that causes Woody to try to get the other ''Roundup'' toys to join him. Unlike most of the other toys, Bullseye cannot communicate in clear speech but sounds like an actual horse and uses body language to speak.\n\nBullseye returns in ''Toy Story 3'' as one of the remaining toys in Andy's room. Bullseye reappears in the short films ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'', ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]].''\n\n====Stinky Pete the Prospector====\nVoiced by [[Kelsey Grammer]]\n\nStinky Pete the Prospector, commonly known as Prospector, is a [[Prospecting|prospector]] doll introduced in ''Toy Story 2''. He is modeled after a character on the fictional television show, ''Woody's Roundup'', which also includes the characters of [[Sheriff Woody]], [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], and Bullseye. In the film, he is in a box designed for him to be sold in that had never been opened, making him still [[Mint condition|\"mint in the box\"]].\n\nIn contrast to the character on the show, Prospector is intelligent, manipulative, and well-spoken. Prospector mentions that he had spent \"a lifetime on a [[dime store]] shelf watching every other toy be sold.\" Prospector openly expresses his hatred for space toys like Buzz Lightyear, whom he blames for causing ''Woody's Roundup'' to be canceled after the launch of [[Sputnik]] (which is launched on the [[Sputnik (rocket)|R-7 derived rocket of the same name]]), which made children all over America lose their interest in cowboy toys, shifting their interest to space adventures instead. According to his box, Prospector has a total of 9 sayings. In one outtake, he is seen talking to two Barbie dolls in the box, saying that he could probably get them a role in the third film; this outtake was later deleted in the 2019 home media reissue, which media outlets inferred as a result of the [[Me Too movement]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjva75/disney-quietly-deleted-a-metoo-scene-out-of-the-latest-release-of-toy-story-2|title=Disney Quietly Deleted a #MeToo Scene Out of the Latest Release of 'Toy Story 2'|last=Geoffroy|first=Kyler|date=July 2, 2019|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref> In another outtake, Prospector suffers a bout of flatulence and says, \"I guess that's why they call me Stinky Pete.\"\n\nProspector appears in the Toy Box mode of ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Concelmo|first=Chad|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-toy-story-3-the-video-game-177903.phtml|title=Review: Toy Story 3: The Video Game |publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref> although Grammer did not reprise the role.\n\n===Al's Toy Barn===\nThe following toy characters are introduced in \"[[#Al McWhiggin|Al]]'s Toy Barn\", which is a chain of toy stores advertised on television in the first two films:\n\n====Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear====\nVoiced by [[Tim Allen]]\n\nWhen searching for Woody at Al's Toy Barn, Buzz comes across the Buzz Lightyear aisle, including a display case labeled \"New Utility Belt\", which contains a newer Buzz Lightyear with a Utility Belt. He believes the original Buzz has escaped his box, and captures him inside one. He is then mistaken by Andy's toys to be the original Buzz and goes with them to rescue Woody, until he decides to join his father, Emperor Zurg.\n\n====Evil Emperor Zurg====\nVoiced by:\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] (''Toy Story 2'')\n* [[Wayne Knight]] (''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'')\n* [[Jess Harnell]] (mini-counterpart in ''Small Fry'')\n\nEvil Emperor Zurg is a space villain action figure and Buzz Lightyear's [[archenemy]]. He has red evil eyes with neon gritting teeth, silver horns on his head, and a purple tunic with a black cape on it. He usually carries a [[raygun]]. Zurg is mentioned in the first film, but does not appear. He debuts in ''Toy Story 2'' where he battles with Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear. Zurg claims he is the father of Buzz, in an almost word-for-word parody of a famous scene in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. In ''Toy Story 3'', Zurg appears briefly during a sequence in the end credits, where he is donated to Sunnyside Daycare center and greeted by the resident toys.\n\nZurg also appears in ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and its direct-to-video film ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]''. Zurg is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Toy Story 3: The Video Game'', in Toy Box Mode. In the game, he has a [[convertible]] (the ZurgsMobile) that matches his personality. Zurg's mini-counterpart is featured in the short film ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]''.\n\nA Zurg toy appears in the 2015 live-action Disney film, ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'', in the Blast from the Past toy store.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |title=5 Tomorrowland Easter Eggs To Keep An Eye Out For |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/5-Tomorrowland-Easter-Eggs-Keep-An-Eye-Out-71591.html |website=CinemaBlend |accessdate=January 24, 2019 |date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Tour Guide Barbie====\nVoiced by [[Jodi Benson]]\n\nTour Guide Barbie is a [[Barbie]] doll who gives Andy's toys a tour of Al's Toy Barn.\n\n====Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots====\n\n\nA pair of [[Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots]] appear in Al's office. When Slinky asks them if they have seen Woody, the Blue Bomber says he has not, after which the Red Rocker starts an argument with the Blue Bomber over which one of them Slinky was asking the question to. They then fight each other in a boxing match, with the Blue Bomber defeating the Red Rocker.\n\n===Al McWhiggin===\nVoiced by [[Wayne Knight]]\n\nAl McWhiggin&nbsp;\u2013 nicknamed \"The Chicken Man\" by Andy's toys&nbsp;\u2013 is the owner of \"Al's Toy Barn\" who collects merchandise related to the old ''Woody's Roundup'' TV show. Introduced in ''Toy Story 2'', he steals Woody in hopes to sell him as well as the Roundup gang to a toy museum in Japan, but following Stinky Pete's defeat and the Roundup gang's escape, he ends up losing the money that he intended to receive for the Roundup toys.\n\nHis car's license plate reads LZTYBRN, which is \"Al's Toy Barn\" (minus the [[vowel]] letters). It is also the actual license plate of [[Ash Brannon]], co-director of ''Toy Story 2,'' according to the ''Toy Story 2: Special Edition'' commentary.\n\n===Mrs. Potato Head===\nVoiced by [[Estelle Harris]]\n\nMrs. Potato Head is [[#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]]'s wife. Unlike her husband, Mrs. Potato Head is sweet and not hot-headed or impatient. She is mentioned in the first movie, but is not seen until ''Toy Story 2''. She has a larger role in ''Toy Story 3'', as for most of the film, one of her eyes is lost in Andy's room, and it is through this eye that she sees Andy complaining that his toys are missing, causing the other toys to realise that Andy never intended to throw them away. She views the Aliens as her \"babies\", but her husband does not share this view until the Aliens save them from the incinerator using a claw crane. Mrs. Potato Head reappears in the theatrical short film ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'' and acts as a tour guide for Ken and Barbie in their Hawaiian adventures. She also reappears in ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', and ''Toy Story 4''.\n\n===Wheezy===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Joe Ranft]] (''Toy Story 2'')\n* [[Robert Goulet]] (singing voice in ''Toy Story 2'')\n\nWheezy is Andy's squeeze toy [[penguin]] with a red [[bowtie]]. He is introduced when [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] finds him on a shelf, where Wheezy had been placed after his squeaker broke, upsetting Andy. Wheezy does not directly appear in ''Toy Story 3'', except in footage showing Andy as a young boy. Woody says that Wheezy was one of Andy's toys who went to new owners. Wheezy appears in the Toy Box mode in ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]''.\n\n===The cleaner===\nVoiced by [[Jonathan Harris]]\n\nThe cleaner is an elderly specialist in toy restoration and repair with a fully loaded toy repair kit. He comes to Al's apartment to fix Woody up, including reattaching his ripped off arm, in preparation of selling him to the toy museum. He insists that Al let him take his time with the work and views it as more than a simple job, asserting, \"You can't rush art.\"\n\nThe character model had been previously used to portray Geri (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) in Pixar's 1997 short, ''[[Geri's Game]]'', where he plays a chess game against himself. In ''Toy Story 2'', one of the drawers in the cleaner's carrying case contains chess pieces, a reference to the short.\n\n===Emily===\nEmily is Jessie's former owner and is mentioned by her in the film. She appears in a flashback musical sequence while \"[[When She Loved Me]]\" by [[Sarah McLachlan]] is played. As a young girl, she was a fan of \"Woody's Roundup\" and enjoyed playing with Jessie. However, as she got older, she became more interested in makeup and talking with her friends on the phone, causing her to forget about Jessie, who had fallen under her bed, for years. As a teenager, she rediscovers Jessie and leaves her in a charity box, causing Jessie to develop claustrophobia and a fear of being abandoned.\n\n===Buster===\nBuster is Andy's pet [[dachshund]]. In ''Toy Story 2'', Buster is very energetic and is nice to Andy's toys (who had expressed concern after discovering that Andy had gotten a puppy for Christmas at the end of the first film). He obeys commands given to him by Woody, who uses Buster to rescue Wheezy from a yard sale; however, he never listens to Andy. In ''Toy Story 3'', Buster is now older, visibly aged, and overweight. Because of that, he is unable to help Woody rescue Andy's other toys, instead falling asleep. He stays with Mrs. Davis while Andy goes to college.\n\n==Introduced in ''Toy Story 3'' (2010)==\nThe third film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), features a total of 302 characters.<ref name=Geeky/> The following notable characters appear in the film.\n\n===Sunnyside toys===\nThe following toys live at the Sunnyside Daycare center:\n\n====Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear====\nVoiced by [[Ned Beatty]]\n\nLots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Lotso for short) is a pink [[teddy bear]] with a big plum nose, a strawberry scent and a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], who uses a wooden toy [[mallet]] as an [[assistive cane]] (although he is still able to walk without it). He is the leader of the toys at the Sunnyside Daycare center. He initially acts like a kind-hearted and wise caretaker, but is eventually revealed to be a ruthless [[prison warden]]. After his true character is revealed by Woody, all of Lotso's crew turn on him, and Big Baby throws him into a dumpster. His reign of terror ends when the dumpster is then collected by a garbage truck and driven to the landfill, where he is later strapped to the front of another truck after leaving Andy's toys to die in an incinerator.\n\nLotso was intended to be in the first film (originally for a sequel to ''[[Tin Toy]]''),<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=2010|editor-last=Behling|editor-first=Steve|editor2-last=Weingartner|editor2-first=Amy|title=Toy Story 3 Behind the Scenes|url=|magazine=Toy Story 3 Official Movie Magazine|page=24|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|quote=Lotso was originally created for a Christmas special that later became Toy Story.}}</ref> but the technology to represent realistic fur was not available until 2001's ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307265753/page/199|title=The Pixar Touch|last=Price|first=David|publisher=Alfred A.

Ken and Barbie appear in the theatrical short, ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]''.\n\n====Big Baby====\nVoiced by Woody Smith\n\nBig Baby is a baby doll with a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]] who carries around a bottle and is adorned with childlike scribbling that resembles ferocious [[tattoos]]. He normally does not speak, instead communicating through baby sounds, with the exception of one spoken line (\"Mama\") after the toys escape Sunnyside. He acts as Lotso's assistant and helps guide the new toys around and punishes them when they step out of line. He, Lotso and Chuckles were all owned by Daisy until they were lost in the countryside. They made their own way home, but Lotso saw that Daisy's parents had replaced him. Lotso's personality changed, and he lied to Big Baby telling him that he was replaced too, and they went to Sunnyside, where Lotso took over and acted as a prison warden. Big Baby later realized Lotso lied to him, after Woody returned to save his friends and brought up Daisy when confronted by Lotso after escaping. After Lotso destroyed the tag bearing their previous owner's name, Big Baby threw Lotso into the dumpster, while Lotso's henchmen watched. Lotso was then picked up by the garbage truck and driven to the landfill, making Sunnyside peaceful again.\n\nThe baby who provided the voice for Big Baby is named \"Woody,\" according to director [[Lee Unkrich]],<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Unkrich, Lee |author-link=Lee Unkrich |user=leeunkrich |number=16818179119 |date=June 22, 2010 |title=Big Baby says one line in Toy Story 3.

He helps to reprogram Buzz and apprehend Andy's other toy, and also operates a [[searchlight]] in the playground to look out for escaped toys.

At first, she welcomes Andy's toys, but later helps capture them with her elastic arms. After they escape, she traps them near the edge of a garbage chute and is ready to push them into the dumpster below. She is then seen visibly cringing at Lotso's true character being revealed. Eventually, Lotso angrily orders Stretch to push the toys into the dumpster, which she refuses to do. Eventually, Lotso is thrown into the dumpster by Big Baby for his lies and treachery, and Stretch immediately leaves the area. In the credits, she welcomes new toys happily and is later seen slipping a message from Ken and Barbie to Woody and his friends into Bonnie's backpack.\n* {{visible anchor|Chunk}} (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) \u2013 An orange rock monster toy and one of Lotso's henchmen who eventually helps imprison Andy's toys.

He can only speak when his receiver is lifted from its cradle. He lives in the Caterpillar Room, and has been at Sunnyside for years. He becomes an ally to Woody. When Woody returns to Sunnyside, Chatter Telephone says that coming back was a mistake because Lotso had since improved his security. Although his advice is to lay low, he reluctantly gives Woody instructions on how to escape Sunnyside. He shows Woody a garbage chute leading to a dumpster, where broken toys go before being collected by a garbage truck at dawn and taken to the dump, which he says is the only way toys leave Sunnyside. He is later beaten and broken by Lotso and his crew for helping the toys escape, and apologizes to Woody. In the credits, he has been repaired and is shown happily attending a toy party in the Butterfly Room.\n* {{visible anchor|Bookworm}} (voiced by [[Richard Kind]]) \u2013 A green toy worm with a built-in flashlight who wears glasses. He keeps a library of instruction manuals in a closet at Sunnyside, and gives Lotso the instruction manual for Buzz Lightyear. He later gives the same manual to Barbie (whom he thinks is Ken since she is wearing his spacesuit outfit). In the credits, he is seen happily using his flashlight to light a disco ball during a party at Sunnyside. He only has two lines in the film.\n* A monkey toy, based on the [[Cymbal-banging monkey toy|Musical Jolly Chimp]] toy from the 1960s, monitors the Sunnyside Daycare [[security cameras]] at night, and can alert Lotso and the gang of any toys attempting to escape by screeching into a microphone to broadcast over the [[intercom]]. Chatter Telephone tells Woody that he must get rid of the monkey before he and his friends can escape. Woody and Slinky manage to wrap the monkey up in [[Scotch Tape]] and lock it in a [[filing cabinet]]. In the credits, the monkey is seen happily playing its [[clash cymbals]] while wearing star-shaped sunglasses.\n* A [[jack-in-the-box]] toy has one line in the film when he greets Andy's toys, exclaiming, \"New toys!\" He is voiced by the film's director, [[Lee Unkrich]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Toy Story 3 Easter Eggs \u2013 Page 2 of 3 |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-3-easter-eggs/2/ |website=/Film |accessdate=February 7, 2019 |date=June 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Barbie===\nVoiced by [[Jodi Benson]]\n\nA [[Barbie]] doll is one of the toys that Andy's sister, Molly, owns until she decides to donate it.

When Bonnie and her mother went to Sleep Well after their car got a flat tire, Mr. Jones steals a number of Bonnie's toys, including Woody, Buzz, and Jessie. Ron then takes pictures of the toys and puts them on his bidding sale, awaiting buyers. Jessie manages to trick Mr. Jones into tearing off a curtain, revealing the toys' location and Ron's scheme to Bonnie and her mother, who then calls the police. Two police officers later arrive to question Ron, who attempts to escape by stealing their car but is forced to flee on foot after immediately crashing it into the motel sign. The police officers initiate a manhunt for him.\n\nThe following toys were stolen from their owners during their stay at the Sleep Well motel.

Cope) is Bonnie's friend, and a post-Christmas playdate between the pair serves as the setting for the special. Mason receives a Battlesaurs toy collection for Christmas but is distracted from them by a new video game system. However, due to Trixie and Reptillus' efforts he abandons the video game and plays with his new toys. He is later shown to write his name on his toys in similar fashion to Andy and Bonnie.\n* Battlesaurs \u2013 A group of mostly humanoid dinosaur toys who initially believe themselves to be real beings rather than playthings (like Buzz in the first film). This illusion is encouraged by Mason's greater interest in a new video game system that he received for Christmas, and they become hostile to Mason's other toys and to Bonnie's when they are brought over for a playdate. However, Trixie is eventually able to convince them that being played with brings its own joy, and they happily embrace their life as toys.\n** Reptillus Maximus (voiced by [[Kevin McKidd]]) \u2013 The Champion of the Battlesaurs, who is fascinated by Trixie after meeting her. Initially, Reptillus is resistant to the idea of being a plaything, feeling that to submit to the will of his child would be surrender and dishonorable. However, Trixie later helps him to see that being there for Mason is honorable, and he helps her divert Mason's attention to his new toys. Near the end of ''Toy Story That Time Forgot'', it is implied that he has a crush on Trixie. Reptillus has a cameo in ''Toy Story 4'' as his picture is seen on a lunchbox in Bonnie's kindergarten class.\n** The Cleric (voiced by [[Steve Purcell]]) \u2013 The \"spiritual\" leader of the Battlesaurs. The Cleric is the first Battlesaur shown to be aware of their status as toys, but conceals it from the others so that he can rule over them and Mason's other toys. However, his plans are thwarted when Reptillus sides with Trixie; he is later shown apparently enjoying his new role as Mason's plaything.\n** Ray-Gon (voiced by [[Jonathan Kydd (actor)|Jonathan Kydd]]) \u2013 The armorer of the Battlesaurs, his main contribution is providing Trixie and Rex with battle armor, with the latter featuring remote-control arms that the Cleric uses to manipulate Rex.\n** Goliathon \u2013 A large creature used by the other Battlesaurs to imprison their enemies in its belly.\n* Angel Kitty (voiced by Emma Hudak) is an angel cat ornament on Bonnie's Christmas tree. Bonnie briefly uses Angel Kitty during playtime, portraying her as a dinosaur. A running gag in the special is Angel Kitty giving a moral about Christmas much to other toys' (mostly Trixie) dismay and joy. Angel Kitty has a small trumpet and a halo. In her final scene, she gives a moral to Bonnie's toys and then vanishes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Toy Story}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Toy Story'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toy Story}}\n[[Category:Lists of Disney animated film characters]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters| ]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Merge from|Forky|discuss=Talk:List of Toy Story characters#Proposed merge with Forky|date=January 2020}}\nThis is a list of characters from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Introduced in ''Toy Story'' (1995)==\n===Andy's toys===\n[[#Andy Davis|Andy Davis]] owns various toys who would also appear in later films.

His wife is [[#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]], and they become the adoptive parents to a trio of [[#Aliens / Little Green Men|Aliens]] in the second film.

Slinky's head, feet, and tail are plastic; he has a green collar. Slinky Dog was partially redesigned for the film by Pixar artist [[Bud Luckey]] to make him more appealing as an animated character. In the opening scenes of the first and third films, Slinky is described by Andy as One-Eyed Bart's \"attack dog with a built-in [[force field (fiction)|force field]]\".\n\nSlinky Dog appears in ''Toy Story'' and ''Toy Story 2'', voiced by Jim Varney.

Rex suffers from anxiety, an [[inferiority complex]] and the concern that he is not scary enough. Although Rex is a toy dinosaur, he dislikes confrontation and is sensitive in nature. He is among the largest of Andy's toys. In the opening scenes of the first and third films, he is described by Andy as Woody's \"dinosaur who eats [[force field (fiction)|force field]] dogs\", in reference to Slinky Dog. Rex is voiced by [[Earl Boen]] (credited as \"Earl Bowen\") in the video game ''[[Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite video game |title=Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue |developer=Traveller's Tales |publisher=Activision |date=1999 |platform=Nintendo 64 |scene=End credits }}</ref>\n\nRex appears in each of the ''Toy Story'' movies.

He and Mr. Potato Head are friends, and are seen in the first film playing a card game, and later [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]], which Hamm always wins. Out of all the toys, he is shown to have the most knowledge of the outside, often being familiar with various gadgets that are shown. In the second and third films, Andy describes Hamm as Evil Dr. Pork Chop. In the third film, Evil Dr. Pork Chop has a giant pig-shaped aircraft, which he uses to rescue One-Eyed Bart and One-Eyed Betty (the Potato Heads).\n\nHamm appears in each of the ''Toy Story'' movies. He appears in the post-credit scene of ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as part of a homage and self-parody to Ratzenberger (who voices the [[Mack (Cars)|Mack Super-Liner]] in the film). Hamm also briefly appears in ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins'', voiced by Andrew Stanton. In a 2010 television advertisement for the [[United States Postal Service]] promoting ''Toy Story 3,'' Hamm wears a postal worker's outfit while promoting the Priority Mail service; Ratzenberger is best known for his role as mailman [[Cliff Clavin]] on the long-running sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |title=Postal Service, 'Toy Story 3' team up |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/06/postal_service_toy_story_3_tea.html |accessdate=February 19, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=June 9, 2010}}</ref> Hamm also makes an appearance in ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'' as the mayor in Toy Box mode.

He also appears in ''Toy Story 3'' through home video footage from when Andy was young.\n* The [[Magic 8-Ball]] makes brief appearances in the first three films. In the first film, Woody asked the ball if Andy would pick him instead of Buzz Lightyear to take along with him to Pizza Planet, but the ball's reply was \"Don't Count On It\", making Woody upset. Woody shoves the ball away, and it falls behind a desk. The ball is donated to Sunnyside daycare in the third film.\n* Mr. Mike \u2013 A toy [[tape recorder]] who helped Woody amplify his voice during a toy meeting with his attached microphone.

At the end of the film, he repairs Wheezy by finding him an extra squeaker.\n* {{visible anchor|Mr. Spell}} \u2013 A toy with a built-in keyboard who speaks words that are typed in. He makes brief appearances in the first two films, and it is stated that he has held toy [[seminar]]s on topics such as \"plastic corrosion awareness\" and \"what to do if you or part of you is swallowed.\" In ''Toy Story 2'', Buzz uses him to help figure out the identity of the man who stole Woody from the yard sale. He does not appear in ''Toy Story 3''.\n* Robot \u2013 A robot toy. In ''Toy Story'', he stands on his head for Buzz to run on his treads like a treadmill. In ''Toy Story 2'', he assists Buzz in making sure all of Andy's toys are accounted for once they learn of a yard sale.

A group of Troll dolls also appears in the third film's opening sequence, in which they are portrayed as orphans on a runaway train during Andy's playtime.\n* [[Barrel of Monkeys]] \u2013 A barrel used to contain red monkeys, whose arms connect to each other. In a brief appearance, the monkeys are lowered by Andy's other toys out of the bedroom window in an attempt to retrieve Buzz, but the plan fails as there are not enough monkeys. They make brief appearances in the next two films during Andy's playtime. A Barrel of Monkeys is also briefly featured as one of [[#Bonnie|Bonnie]]'s toys in the short film ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]''.\n\n===Davis family===\n====Andy Davis====\nVoiced by:\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] (all four films)\n* Charlie Bright (young Andy in ''Toy Story 3'')\n* Jack McGraw (young Andy in ''Toy Story 4'')<ref>{{cite web |last=Cooley |first=Josh |authorlink=Josh Cooley |title=I'd be crying too, Maddy and Jack are incredible actors. |url=https://twitter.com/CooleyUrFaceOff/status/1132124488659718144 |website=Twitter |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAndy Davis is the owner of [[Sheriff Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear]] and the other toys in the first three films.

In ''Toy Story 2'', Andy's mother calls Woody \"an old family toy\" and [[#Stinky Pete the Prospector|Prospector]] calls him a [[hand-me-down]] toy.

In the first film, she has brown hair and she ties it into a ponytail. In the other two films, her physical appearance is noticeably different and instead of brown, she has blonde hair and leaves it down. Mrs. Davis is presented as a loving mother to Andy and Molly, but is a major (though indirect) threat to the toys. Mrs. Davis' actions regarding the toys sets the plot in motion in all three films, though they are not malicious. In the first film, she purchases a Buzz Lightyear toy for Andy on his birthday, prompting the rivalry between Buzz and Woody which leads to them being lost and forced to find their way home. In the second film, she puts Wheezy up for sale at a yard sale, prompting Woody's rescue attempt where he is subsequently stolen by Al. In the third film, she tells Andy to clean out his room before going to college and mistakenly throws away the toys Andy planned to put in the attic. Despite this, in the second film, she is very protective of Woody, describing him as an old family toy. At the end of the third film, she breaks down and weeps at the departure of her son, but Andy reassures her that she will always be with him even if they are apart. This moment between mother and son plays a major factor in Woody deciding to have Andy donate his toys to Bonnie, thus giving them a new lease on their lives.\n\nIn 2014, [[blogger]] Jon Negroni theorized that Mrs. Davis is [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]'s original owner, [[#Emily|Emily]], based on the flashback sequence of Jessie and Emily from ''Toy Story 2''. The sequence shows Emily as a child in the 1960s, which is when Mrs. Davis would have been a child. The sequence also shows that the cowboy hat that Emily had is very similar to Andy's hat but with an additional white lace area, and Emily's hair was brown, just like Mrs. Davis's hair in the first film. However while sharing the same colour, the hats are in fact different shapes reflecting the hats worn by their favourite toy (Andy's being a teardrop shape like Woody's and Emily's being circular like Jessie's).<ref name=Hernandez>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|url=http://kotaku.com/a-bonkers-theory-on-the-true-identity-of-andys-mom-in-1530187231|title=A Bonkers Theory on The True Identity of Andy's Mom In ''Toy Story''|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Negroni>{{cite web|last=Negroni|first=Jon|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/02/24/toy-story-the-true-identity-of-andy-s-mom-makes-the-movie-more-epic-1247874|title=Toy Story: The True Identity of Andy's Mom Makes The Movie More Epic|publisher=[[Moviepilot]]|date=February 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609161342/https://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/02/24/toy-story-the-true-identity-of-andy-s-mom-makes-the-movie-more-epic-1247874|archivedate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Molly Davis====\nVoiced by:\n* Hannah Unkrich (''Toy Story 2'' and archived footage in ''Toy Story 3'')\n* [[Bea Miller]] (''Toy Story 3'')\n* Uncredited actress (''Toy Story 4'')\n\nMolly Davis is Andy's younger sister, seen as an infant in the first film, a toddler in the second film, and as a preteen in the third film. Andy uses her crib as a town jail during playtime at the beginning of the first film, showing they share a room. When the family moves later in the film, Andy and Molly get separate rooms, though Molly has plans to move into Andy's room once he leaves for college. In the first film, she slobbers on Mr. Potato Head and throws him from the crib, causing his parts to scatter and earning her the nickname \"Princess Drool\" from him. At the end of the film, she receives a [[#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]] toy for Christmas. In ''Toy Story 3'', she also owned [[#Barbie|a Barbie doll]], which she donates to the daycare center as she was less interested in dolls and toys by that time.\n\nIn ''Toy Story 2'', young Molly was voiced by co-director [[Lee Unkrich]]'s daughter, Hannah Unkrich.

Sid is known for torturing and destroying toys. Many of his toys are either destroyed, have missing pieces, or replaced with parts from other toys. He is also shown tormenting his sister, Hannah, and destroying her toys, such as by blowing them up, burning them or decapitating them. He also enjoys [[skateboard]]ing, and his shirt depicts a skull that would later be used as the logo for [[Zero Skateboards]]. The toys mention that he was consistently kicked out of summer camp; and in the audio commentary on the tenth anniversary DVD, the directors mention that he is a bully but also the \"most creative character in the movie\". His parents do not make any major appearances: his mother's voice is only heard briefly several times in the film, and his father is only seen briefly asleep on a chair in front of a TV.\n\nHe is the only human in the films to observe toys actually coming to life, when near the end of the first film, Woody and Sid's mutant toys decide to rescue Buzz by scaring Sid, which causes him to become frightened of toys. The last straw is Woody coming alive while Sid is holding him and telling him to \"play nice\". This causes Sid to panic and run back into his house screaming, and then to his room when his sister scares him with her new toy doll, Sally.\n\nSid does not appear in the second film, although he is mentioned by Buzz during the toys' mission to rescue Woody from the toy collector Al McWhiggin. Sid also appears in the four-issue ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' comic mini-series produced by [[Boom! Comics]].\n\nIn the third film, Sid (now an adult) makes brief appearances in two scenes once again voiced by Erik von Detten. He is shown to be a bearded garbageman recognizable by his characteristic skull T-shirt. His only dialogue in this movie involves humming guitar riffs, and he is depicted listening to [[heavy metal music]] through a pair of large headphones.\n\n====Hannah Phillips====\nVoiced by [[Sarah Freeman (actress)|Sarah Freeman]]\n\nHannah Phillips is Sid's sweet-natured, younger sister who appears a few times in the film. Hannah has adjusted to her toys being [[mutilate]]d by Sid. Most of her dolls either have different heads or altered body parts, and at the end of the film she finds enjoyment in scaring her brother after he has been horrified by Woody and the other toys. She spends most of the time during the movie playing with her altered dolls.\n\n====Sid and Hannah's toys====\nThe following toys belong to Sid and Hannah.\n\nHannah has several dolls, although some have been beheaded by Sid. During the film, one of Hannah's [[rag doll]]s, Janie, is taken by Sid, who switches her head with that of a toy [[Pteranodon]]. Hannah also has a rag doll named Sally.\n\nSid has various mutant toys who are assembled by him from mixed pieces of several toys that belong to him and Hannah. Sid's mutant toys do not speak, but they understand [[Morse code]]. Buzz and Woody initially think that they are [[cannibal]]s who are going to eat them, before they learn that the toys are actually friendly and compassionate. They fix Buzz's broken arm, Janie and the Pteranodon, and also help Woody implement his plan to save Buzz from Sid. They surround Sid as Woody tells him how much they hate being mutilated, and they all rejoice in victory after Woody frightens Sid away with his own voice. After Sid is scared by his toys, he sees Sally (Hannah's new doll and a replacement for Janie), then runs off in fright, thinking that Sally will come to life. Sid's mutant toys include:\n\n* Babyface<ref name=TSRacer/> &nbsp;\u2013 A one-eyed baby doll head staked on top of a [[spider]]-like body with [[crab]]-like pincers made of [[Erector Set]] pieces. Babyface is shown communicating with the other toys by banging in Morse code on the side of Sid's metal bedpost with his big claw. This method is used when he signals the other mutant toys to gather around to listen to Woody as he formulates his plan to rescue Buzz from Sid. When the mutant toys surround Sid, Babyface, suspended by Legs, lands on Sid's head, scaring him. Babyface appears in ''[[Toy Story Treats]]'', and is a playable character in the 2001 video game ''[[Toy Story Racer]]''.<ref name=TSRacer/> In 2010, Disney released a remote-controlled Babyface toy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Cool Stuff: Babyface Toy Story Remote Control Toy |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-babyface-toy-story-remote-control-toy/ |website=/Film |accessdate=February 12, 2019 |date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>\n* Legs&nbsp;\u2013 A toy [[fishing rod]] with doll legs. When Woody formulates his plan to save Buzz from Sid, he assigns Legs to partner up with Ducky. Legs opens the vent grating so she and Ducky can go to the front porch, where Legs lowers Ducky through the hole Ducky created so Ducky can swing toward the doorbell. After Ducky catches the Frog, Legs pulls both toys up to safety. Later, when the mutant toys advance on Sid, Legs lowers Babyface onto Sid's head, scaring him. Legs also appears in ''Toy Story Treats''.\n* A [[jack-in-the-box]] toy with a green arm that pops out. During Woody's plan to save Buzz from Sid, the toy extends its hand to Sid's doorknob, ready to open the door when the signal comes. The hand later grabs Sid's leg when the mutant toys surround him. The toy also appears in ''Toy Story Treats''.\n* Roller Bob&nbsp;\u2013 A [[jet plane|jet pilot]] action figure, whose torso has been attached to a [[skateboard]]. After the Frog is let out of Sid's room to distract Scud, Roller Bob ferries Woody and the other mutant toys outside the house to Sid's yard.\n* Rock Mobile<ref name=TSgame/>&nbsp;\u2013 The head of a toy insect attached on top of a small, headless human torso toy who is holding a steering wheel. This torso is attached in the head socket of a larger, muscular human torso toy that is missing its legs. \n* Frog&nbsp;\u2013 A tin wind-up [[frog]] with two different wheels instead of back legs. The Frog is also missing its left front foot. As part of Woody's plot to rescue Buzz from Sid, Woody orders, \"Wind the Frog!\", at which point the frog is wound up. When Ducky rings the doorbell, the Frog is let out of Sid's room, allowing Scud to chase him down the stairs and out to the front porch, where he is caught by Ducky; Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n* Ducky&nbsp;\u2013 A [[duck]]-headed [[Pez]] dispenser with a baby doll torso and plunger base. He and Legs go to the front porch via the vent, and Ducky, suspended from the porch ceiling by Legs, swings toward the doorbell until he finally activates it, giving Woody the signal to release the Frog. Ducky catches the Frog as Legs reels both toys up to safety.\n\nAdditionally, Sid has a non-mutant soldier toy called {{Visible anchor|Combat Carl}}, who is blown up by Sid with an [[M-80 (explosive)|explosive device]]. Combat Carl is Caucasian; a [[#Combat Carl 2|different character with the same name]], who is African-American, appears in ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''\n\nDuring the scene where Woody is telling Sid to play nice, other toys can be seen. these include a burnt rag doll, a pickup truck, 2 toy soldiers covered in mud and the alien that was chewed up by Scud.\n\n====Scud====\nScud is Sid's aggressive [[Bull Terrier]] who enjoys helping his owner torture toys for fun by chewing them up to break every part for him. His viciousness is first demonstrated when Sid sets a squeeze toy Alien on his nose and commands him to maul it mercilessly. Scud is an obstacle for Woody and Buzz as they try to escape Sid's house. Later, Scud prevents Woody and Buzz from trying to reach the moving van to reunite with Andy, since he didn\u2019t know that Sid was scared when the toys came alive. Scud chases the toys, but they escape when Scud chases them into the middle of a traffic intersection, where he is trapped by the cars as they crash while trying to avoid him.\n\n===Aliens / Little Green Men===\nVoiced by:\n*[[Jeff Pidgeon]] (primary voice actor)\n*[[Patrick Warburton]] (''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'')\n\n[[File:Anniversery of the making of Toy Story (26419290611).jpg|thumb|right|Models of the Alien characters]]\nThe Aliens, also known as [[Little green men|Little Green Men]] in the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' television series, are a series of green, three-eyed [[squeaky toy]] aliens. They appear in all three films. In ''Toy Story 2'', three aliens become part of Andy's toy collection and are adopted by [[#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]] and [[#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]]. In the third film, Mr. Potato Head refers to them as \"my boys\", implying that all three are male.\n\nIn ''Toy Story'', Buzz and Woody climb inside a giant rocket-shaped [[Claw crane|claw game]] at Pizza Planet. Inside the claw game are hundreds of squeeze toy aliens. When Buzz asks who is in charge, the Aliens say \"the claw\", which belongs in the machine, they say that the claw \"chooses who will go and who will stay\". Sid spots Buzz inside the claw game and tries to win him. Woody attempts to save Buzz and escape through the claw game's maintenance hatch, but the Aliens stop him and say that they must not fight the claw. Woody, Buzz, and an Alien get taken to Sid's house. Sid gives the Alien to his dog, Scud, who violently chews it as Woody and Buzz watch in horror. Near the end of the movie, the same Alien, now damaged, walks like a zombie toward Sid, part of Woody's plan to scare him.\n\nIn ''Toy Story 2'', a trio of aliens are hanging above the dashboard in the Pizza Planet truck. Buzz groans when he sees them, remembering them from the claw game in the first film. When the toys are having trouble getting the truck to move, the aliens tell Mr. Potato Head to \"use the wand of power\", referring to the truck's gear lever. They nearly fall out of the window, due to the sharp turns from Buzz trying to catch Al in his car. Mr. Potato Head saves the aliens, and they are thankful to him. Throughout the rest of the movie, they frequently say \"You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful,\" much to Potato Head's dismay. The Aliens join the quest to save Woody and mistake the entrance to the baggage area for the \"Mystic Portal\". Back home, the trio, along with Bullseye and Jessie, end up becoming some of Andy's toys. They say their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head, and Mrs. Potato Head is so happy that he saved their lives, she decides they should adopt them, with the Aliens calling Mr. Potato Head \"Daddy\".\n\nIn the opening sequence of ''Toy Story 3'', the Aliens are portrayed by Andy as the henchmen under One-Eyed Bart and One-Eyed Betty (the Potato Heads), serving as the getaway drivers in a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. In the present time, the trio continues to express their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head. They are later donated to Sunnyside along with the rest of Andy's toys. In Sunnyside, the Aliens find a toy crane, which reminds them of the claw game in Pizza Planet. The Aliens get sat on and bounced on during a rough playtime with the toddlers. The toys plan to escape Sunnyside. The Aliens have to go through the playground with Woody and ride on Bullseye. They almost get caught by Big Baby because one of the Aliens falls off Bullseye and squeaks, but manage to hide inside a pail. Later when Andy's toys escape, one of the Alien's feet gets stuck in the lid of a dumpster. After Woody rescues the Alien, Lotso, who had been thrown into the bin by Big Baby, grabs Woody's feet and pulls him into the bin just as the garbage truck arrives. The toys fall into the truck, which transports them to a landfill. The Aliens are separated from the others by a bulldozer when they wander off, having spotted a crane. They are later revealed to be in control of a giant claw crane, which they used to rescue the other toys from an incinerator. Mr. Potato Head finally acknowledges them as his children, reciting their repetitive line, \"You have saved our lives and we are eternally grateful.\" The trio are later donated to Bonnie along with Andy's other toys.\n\nThe Aliens reappear in the theatrical short films ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]],'' ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'' and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', and the 2019 video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''. The Aliens also have a ride at Disney theme parks called [[Alien Swirling Saucers]].\n\n==Introduced in ''Toy Story 2'' (1999)==\n===''Woody's Roundup'' gang===\n====Jessie====\n{{Main|Jessie (Toy Story)}}\nVoiced by [[Joan Cusack]]\n\n[[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] is a cowgirl doll, and part of the ''Woody's Roundup'' gang. In ''Toy Story 2'', Jessie is initially hesitant to join Woody to become one of Andy's toys. After she becomes part of the family, she is very happy. In ''Toy Story 3'', she believes Andy threw her and the other toys out; she argues with Woody, who says Andy was actually putting them in the attic. Later in the film, Jessie becomes close with Buzz, especially when he is in Spanish mode. At the end, they dance to the Spanish version of \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]].\" Jessie also appears in Pixar's 2013 television special ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' as the main character that saves the other toys from the toy stealer and seller at the rest stop.\n\n====Bullseye====\nBullseye is a toy [[horse]] and is part of the ''Woody's Roundup'' collection. In the fictional ''Woody's Roundup'' television series, Bullseye is portrayed as Woody's horse. In ''Toy Story 2'', he was very happy to finally see Woody after a long time in storage. Bullseye is shown to loathe fights as he hides in a can when Jessie jumps on Woody. He is also upset at Woody's intention to abandon the ''Roundup'' gang to return to Andy. When Woody decides to return to Andy's room, it is Bullseye's loyalty that causes Woody to try to get the other ''Roundup'' toys to join him. Unlike most of the other toys, Bullseye cannot communicate in clear speech but sounds like an actual horse and uses body language to speak.\n\nBullseye returns in ''Toy Story 3'' as one of the remaining toys in Andy's room. Bullseye reappears in the short films ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'', ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]].''\n\n====Stinky Pete the Prospector====\nVoiced by [[Kelsey Grammer]]\n\nStinky Pete the Prospector, commonly known as Prospector, is a [[Prospecting|prospector]] doll introduced in ''Toy Story 2''. He is modeled after a character on the fictional television show, ''Woody's Roundup'', which also includes the characters of [[Sheriff Woody]], [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], and Bullseye. In the film, he is in a box designed for him to be sold in that had never been opened, making him still [[Mint condition|\"mint in the box\"]].\n\nIn contrast to the character on the show, Prospector is intelligent, manipulative, and well-spoken. Prospector mentions that he had spent \"a lifetime on a [[dime store]] shelf watching every other toy be sold.\" Prospector openly expresses his hatred for space toys like Buzz Lightyear, whom he blames for causing ''Woody's Roundup'' to be canceled after the launch of [[Sputnik]] (which is launched on the [[Sputnik (rocket)|R-7 derived rocket of the same name]]), which made children all over America lose their interest in cowboy toys, shifting their interest to space adventures instead. According to his box, Prospector has a total of 9 sayings. In one outtake, he is seen talking to two Barbie dolls in the box, saying that he could probably get them a role in the third film; this outtake was later deleted in the 2019 home media reissue, which media outlets inferred as a result of the [[Me Too movement]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjva75/disney-quietly-deleted-a-metoo-scene-out-of-the-latest-release-of-toy-story-2|title=Disney Quietly Deleted a #MeToo Scene Out of the Latest Release of 'Toy Story 2'|last=Geoffroy|first=Kyler|date=July 2, 2019|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref> In another outtake, Prospector suffers a bout of flatulence and says, \"I guess that's why they call me Stinky Pete.\"\n\nProspector appears in the Toy Box mode of ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Concelmo|first=Chad|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-toy-story-3-the-video-game-177903.phtml|title=Review: Toy Story 3: The Video Game |publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref> although Grammer did not reprise the role.\n\n===Al's Toy Barn===\nThe following toy characters are introduced in \"[[#Al McWhiggin|Al]]'s Toy Barn\", which is a chain of toy stores advertised on television in the first two films:\n\n====Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear====\nVoiced by [[Tim Allen]]\n\nWhen searching for Woody at Al's Toy Barn, Buzz comes across the Buzz Lightyear aisle, including a display case labeled \"New Utility Belt\", which contains a newer Buzz Lightyear with a Utility Belt. He believes the original Buzz has escaped his box, and captures him inside one. He is then mistaken by Andy's toys to be the original Buzz and goes with them to rescue Woody, until he decides to join his father, Emperor Zurg.\n\n====Evil Emperor Zurg====\nVoiced by:\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] (''Toy Story 2'')\n* [[Wayne Knight]] (''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'')\n* [[Jess Harnell]] (mini-counterpart in ''Small Fry'')\n\nEvil Emperor Zurg is a space villain action figure and Buzz Lightyear's [[archenemy]]. He has red evil eyes with neon gritting teeth, silver horns on his head, and a purple tunic with a black cape on it. He usually carries a [[raygun]]. Zurg is mentioned in the first film, but does not appear. He debuts in ''Toy Story 2'' where he battles with Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear. Zurg claims he is the father of Buzz, in an almost word-for-word parody of a famous scene in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. In ''Toy Story 3'', Zurg appears briefly during a sequence in the end credits, where he is donated to Sunnyside Daycare center and greeted by the resident toys.\n\nZurg also appears in ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and its direct-to-video film ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]''. Zurg is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Toy Story 3: The Video Game'', in Toy Box Mode. In the game, he has a [[convertible]] (the ZurgsMobile) that matches his personality. Zurg's mini-counterpart is featured in the short film ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]''.\n\nA Zurg toy appears in the 2015 live-action Disney film, ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'', in the Blast from the Past toy store.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |title=5 Tomorrowland Easter Eggs To Keep An Eye Out For |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/5-Tomorrowland-Easter-Eggs-Keep-An-Eye-Out-71591.html |website=CinemaBlend |accessdate=January 24, 2019 |date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Tour Guide Barbie====\nVoiced by [[Jodi Benson]]\n\nTour Guide Barbie is a [[Barbie]] doll who gives Andy's toys a tour of Al's Toy Barn.\n\n====Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots====\n\n\nA pair of [[Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots]] appear in Al's office. When Slinky asks them if they have seen Woody, the Blue Bomber says he has not, after which the Red Rocker starts an argument with the Blue Bomber over which one of them Slinky was asking the question to. They then fight each other in a boxing match, with the Blue Bomber defeating the Red Rocker.\n\n===Al McWhiggin===\nVoiced by [[Wayne Knight]]\n\nAl McWhiggin&nbsp;\u2013 nicknamed \"The Chicken Man\" by Andy's toys&nbsp;\u2013 is the owner of \"Al's Toy Barn\" who collects merchandise related to the old ''Woody's Roundup'' TV show. Introduced in ''Toy Story 2'', he steals Woody in hopes to sell him as well as the Roundup gang to a toy museum in Japan, but following Stinky Pete's defeat and the Roundup gang's escape, he ends up losing the money that he intended to receive for the Roundup toys.\n\nHis car's license plate reads LZTYBRN, which is \"Al's Toy Barn\" (minus the [[vowel]] letters). It is also the actual license plate of [[Ash Brannon]], co-director of ''Toy Story 2,'' according to the ''Toy Story 2: Special Edition'' commentary.\n\n===Mrs. Potato Head===\nVoiced by [[Estelle Harris]]\n\nMrs. Potato Head is [[#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]]'s wife. Unlike her husband, Mrs. Potato Head is sweet and not hot-headed or impatient. She is mentioned in the first movie, but is not seen until ''Toy Story 2''. She has a larger role in ''Toy Story 3'', as for most of the film, one of her eyes is lost in Andy's room, and it is through this eye that she sees Andy complaining that his toys are missing, causing the other toys to realise that Andy never intended to throw them away. She views the Aliens as her \"babies\", but her husband does not share this view until the Aliens save them from the incinerator using a claw crane. Mrs. Potato Head reappears in the theatrical short film ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'' and acts as a tour guide for Ken and Barbie in their Hawaiian adventures. She also reappears in ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'', ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', and ''Toy Story 4''.\n\n===Wheezy===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Joe Ranft]] (''Toy Story 2'')\n* [[Robert Goulet]] (singing voice in ''Toy Story 2'')\n\nWheezy is Andy's squeeze toy [[penguin]] with a red [[bowtie]]. He is introduced when [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] finds him on a shelf, where Wheezy had been placed after his squeaker broke, upsetting Andy. Wheezy does not directly appear in ''Toy Story 3'', except in footage showing Andy as a young boy. Woody says that Wheezy was one of Andy's toys who went to new owners. Wheezy appears in the Toy Box mode in ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]''.\n\n===The cleaner===\nVoiced by [[Jonathan Harris]]\n\nThe cleaner is an elderly specialist in toy restoration and repair with a fully loaded toy repair kit. He comes to Al's apartment to fix Woody up, including reattaching his ripped off arm, in preparation of selling him to the toy museum. He insists that Al let him take his time with the work and views it as more than a simple job, asserting, \"You can't rush art.\"\n\nThe character model had been previously used to portray Geri (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) in Pixar's 1997 short, ''[[Geri's Game]]'', where he plays a chess game against himself. In ''Toy Story 2'', one of the drawers in the cleaner's carrying case contains chess pieces, a reference to the short.\n\n===Emily===\nEmily is Jessie's former owner and is mentioned by her in the film. She appears in a flashback musical sequence while \"[[When She Loved Me]]\" by [[Sarah McLachlan]] is played. As a young girl, she was a fan of \"Woody's Roundup\" and enjoyed playing with Jessie. However, as she got older, she became more interested in makeup and talking with her friends on the phone, causing her to forget about Jessie, who had fallen under her bed, for years. As a teenager, she rediscovers Jessie and leaves her in a charity box, causing Jessie to develop claustrophobia and a fear of being abandoned.\n\n===Buster===\nBuster is Andy's pet [[dachshund]]. In ''Toy Story 2'', Buster is very energetic and is nice to Andy's toys (who had expressed concern after discovering that Andy had gotten a puppy for Christmas at the end of the first film). He obeys commands given to him by Woody, who uses Buster to rescue Wheezy from a yard sale; however, he never listens to Andy. In ''Toy Story 3'', Buster is now older, visibly aged, and overweight. Because of that, he is unable to help Woody rescue Andy's other toys, instead falling asleep. He stays with Mrs. Davis while Andy goes to college.\n\n==Introduced in ''Toy Story 3'' (2010)==\nThe third film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), features a total of 302 characters.<ref name=Geeky/> The following notable characters appear in the film.\n\n===Sunnyside toys===\nThe following toys live at the Sunnyside Daycare center:\n\n====Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear====\nVoiced by [[Ned Beatty]]\n\nLots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Lotso for short) is a pink [[teddy bear]] with a big plum nose, a strawberry scent and a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], who uses a wooden toy [[mallet]] as an [[assistive cane]] (although he is still able to walk without it). He is the leader of the toys at the Sunnyside Daycare center. He initially acts like a kind-hearted and wise caretaker, but is eventually revealed to be a ruthless [[prison warden]]. After his true character is revealed by Woody, all of Lotso's crew turn on him, and Big Baby throws him into a dumpster. His reign of terror ends when the dumpster is then collected by a garbage truck and driven to the landfill, where he is later strapped to the front of another truck after leaving Andy's toys to die in an incinerator.\n\nLotso was intended to be in the first film (originally for a sequel to ''[[Tin Toy]]''),<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=2010|editor-last=Behling|editor-first=Steve|editor2-last=Weingartner|editor2-first=Amy|title=Toy Story 3 Behind the Scenes|url=|magazine=Toy Story 3 Official Movie Magazine|page=24|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|quote=Lotso was originally created for a Christmas special that later became Toy Story.}}</ref> but the technology to represent realistic fur was not available until 2001's ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307265753/page/199|title=The Pixar Touch|last=Price|first=David|publisher=Alfred A.

Ken and Barbie appear in the theatrical short, ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]''.\n\n====Big Baby====\nVoiced by Woody Smith\n\nBig Baby is a baby doll with a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]] who carries around a bottle and is adorned with childlike scribbling that resembles ferocious [[tattoos]]. He normally does not speak, instead communicating through baby sounds, with the exception of one spoken line (\"Mama\") after the toys escape Sunnyside. He acts as Lotso's assistant and helps guide the new toys around and punishes them when they step out of line. He, Lotso and Chuckles were all owned by Daisy until they were lost in the countryside. They made their own way home, but Lotso saw that Daisy's parents had replaced him. Lotso's personality changed, and he lied to Big Baby telling him that he was replaced too, and they went to Sunnyside, where Lotso took over and acted as a prison warden. Big Baby later realized Lotso lied to him, after Woody returned to save his friends and brought up Daisy when confronted by Lotso after escaping. After Lotso destroyed the tag bearing their previous owner's name, Big Baby threw Lotso into the dumpster, while Lotso's henchmen watched. Lotso was then picked up by the garbage truck and driven to the landfill, making Sunnyside peaceful again.\n\nThe baby who provided the voice for Big Baby is named \"Woody,\" according to director [[Lee Unkrich]],<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Unkrich, Lee |author-link=Lee Unkrich |user=leeunkrich |number=16818179119 |date=June 22, 2010 |title=Big Baby says one line in Toy Story 3.

He helps to reprogram Buzz and apprehend Andy's other toy, and also operates a [[searchlight]] in the playground to look out for escaped toys. During the credits, he is seen living in a happier Sunnyside and is shown taking a turn to endure playtime with the young children in the Caterpillar Room.\n* {{visible anchor|Stretch}} (voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]]) \u2013 A rubber toy [[octopus]] with a glittery purple body, and the sole female member of Lotso's gang. At first, she welcomes Andy's toys, but later helps capture them with her elastic arms. After they escape, she traps them near the edge of a garbage chute and is ready to push them into the dumpster below. She is then seen visibly cringing at Lotso's true character being revealed. Eventually, Lotso angrily orders Stretch to push the toys into the dumpster, which she refuses to do. Eventually, Lotso is thrown into the dumpster by Big Baby for his lies and treachery, and Stretch immediately leaves the area. In the credits, she welcomes new toys happily and is later seen slipping a message from Ken and Barbie to Woody and his friends into Bonnie's backpack.\n* {{visible anchor|Chunk}} (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) \u2013 An orange rock monster toy and one of Lotso's henchmen who eventually helps imprison Andy's toys. He has low intelligence, two blue eyes, and a face that can be changed by rolling it up or down to a different facial expression with red eyes. In the credits, he is seen taking the abuse of the younger children, later taking a rest while Twitch takes his place.\n* {{visible anchor|Sparks}} (voiced by [[Jan Rabson]]) \u2013 A robot toy at Sunnyside Daycare and one of Lotso's henchmen. He only has one line, when he points out Chunk's low intelligence.\n* {{visible anchor|Chatter Telephone}} (voiced by [[Teddy Newton]]) \u2013 A character based on the real-life [[Chatter Telephone|toy of the same name]]. He can only speak when his receiver is lifted from its cradle. He lives in the Caterpillar Room, and has been at Sunnyside for years. He becomes an ally to Woody. When Woody returns to Sunnyside, Chatter Telephone says that coming back was a mistake because Lotso had since improved his security. Although his advice is to lay low, he reluctantly gives Woody instructions on how to escape Sunnyside. He shows Woody a garbage chute leading to a dumpster, where broken toys go before being collected by a garbage truck at dawn and taken to the dump, which he says is the only way toys leave Sunnyside.

In the credits, he is seen happily using his flashlight to light a disco ball during a party at Sunnyside. He only has two lines in the film.\n* A monkey toy, based on the [[Cymbal-banging monkey toy|Musical Jolly Chimp]] toy from the 1960s, monitors the Sunnyside Daycare [[security cameras]] at night, and can alert Lotso and the gang of any toys attempting to escape by screeching into a microphone to broadcast over the [[intercom]]. Chatter Telephone tells Woody that he must get rid of the monkey before he and his friends can escape. Woody and Slinky manage to wrap the monkey up in [[Scotch Tape]] and lock it in a [[filing cabinet]]. In the credits, the monkey is seen happily playing its [[clash cymbals]] while wearing star-shaped sunglasses.\n* A [[jack-in-the-box]] toy has one line in the film when he greets Andy's toys, exclaiming, \"New toys!\" He is voiced by the film's director, [[Lee Unkrich]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Toy Story 3 Easter Eggs \u2013 Page 2 of 3 |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-3-easter-eggs/2/ |website=/Film |accessdate=February 7, 2019 |date=June 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Barbie===\nVoiced by [[Jodi Benson]]\n\nA [[Barbie]] doll is one of the toys that Andy's sister, Molly, owns until she decides to donate it.

She initially owned Lotso, Big Baby and Chuckles, but accidentally left them behind at a rest area along the road. In order to pacify her, Daisy's parents bought her another Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear rather than finding Lotso and the rest of her toys, which made Lotso think he had been replaced and forgotten about, and changed him into a sinister, ruthless toy. Chuckles held onto a tag bearing Daisy's name that was once worn by Big Baby.

He has a habit of stealing toys from customers in his motel and selling them on the Internet, with the help of his pet iguana, Mr. Jones (non-speaking character, portrayed by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]), who snatches the toys in the middle of the night. When Bonnie and her mother went to Sleep Well after their car got a flat tire, Mr. Jones steals a number of Bonnie's toys, including Woody, Buzz, and Jessie. Ron then takes pictures of the toys and puts them on his bidding sale, awaiting buyers. Jessie manages to trick Mr. Jones into tearing off a curtain, revealing the toys' location and Ron's scheme to Bonnie and her mother, who then calls the police. Two police officers later arrive to question Ron, who attempts to escape by stealing their car but is forced to flee on foot after immediately crashing it into the motel sign. The police officers initiate a manhunt for him.\n\nThe following toys were stolen from their owners during their stay at the Sleep Well motel. They eventually escape with help from Jessie, and depart the Sleep Well on a mail truck.\n\n* {{anchor|Combat Carl 2}}Combat Carl (voiced by [[Carl Weathers]])&nbsp;\u2013 A [[G.I. Joe]]-esque action figure. He is African-American in appearance, unlike the Caucasian [[#Combat Carl|character of the same name]] who briefly appeared in the first film.

Cope) is Bonnie's friend, and a post-Christmas playdate between the pair serves as the setting for the special. Mason receives a Battlesaurs toy collection for Christmas but is distracted from them by a new video game system. However, due to Trixie and Reptillus' efforts he abandons the video game and plays with his new toys. He is later shown to write his name on his toys in similar fashion to Andy and Bonnie.\n* Battlesaurs \u2013 A group of mostly humanoid dinosaur toys who initially believe themselves to be real beings rather than playthings (like Buzz in the first film). This illusion is encouraged by Mason's greater interest in a new video game system that he received for Christmas, and they become hostile to Mason's other toys and to Bonnie's when they are brought over for a playdate. However, Trixie is eventually able to convince them that being played with brings its own joy, and they happily embrace their life as toys.\n** Reptillus Maximus (voiced by [[Kevin McKidd]]) \u2013 The Champion of the Battlesaurs, who is fascinated by Trixie after meeting her. Initially, Reptillus is resistant to the idea of being a plaything, feeling that to submit to the will of his child would be surrender and dishonorable. However, Trixie later helps him to see that being there for Mason is honorable, and he helps her divert Mason's attention to his new toys. Near the end of ''Toy Story That Time Forgot'', it is implied that he has a crush on Trixie. Reptillus has a cameo in ''Toy Story 4'' as his picture is seen on a lunchbox in Bonnie's kindergarten class.\n** The Cleric (voiced by [[Steve Purcell]]) \u2013 The \"spiritual\" leader of the Battlesaurs. The Cleric is the first Battlesaur shown to be aware of their status as toys, but conceals it from the others so that he can rule over them and Mason's other toys. However, his plans are thwarted when Reptillus sides with Trixie; he is later shown apparently enjoying his new role as Mason's plaything.\n** Ray-Gon (voiced by [[Jonathan Kydd (actor)|Jonathan Kydd]]) \u2013 The armorer of the Battlesaurs, his main contribution is providing Trixie and Rex with battle armor, with the latter featuring remote-control arms that the Cleric uses to manipulate Rex.\n** Goliathon \u2013 A large creature used by the other Battlesaurs to imprison their enemies in its belly.\n* Angel Kitty (voiced by Emma Hudak) is an angel cat ornament on Bonnie's Christmas tree. Bonnie briefly uses Angel Kitty during playtime, portraying her as a dinosaur. A running gag in the special is Angel Kitty giving a moral about Christmas much to other toys' (mostly Trixie) dismay and joy. Angel Kitty has a small trumpet and a halo. In her final scene, she gives a moral to Bonnie's toys and then vanishes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Toy Story}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Toy Story'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toy Story}}\n[[Category:Lists of Disney animated film characters]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters| ]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n", "name_user": "2601:cb:8200:7220:6444:8629:a7dc:c401", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters"}

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, ''a sexton was just another name for a janitor.''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Peyton excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father for the order's focus towards the Holy Family and its precision towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C. to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941 Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]] to [[Madrid, Spain]] across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan ''\"The family that prays together stays together.\"''\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

Uninhabited islands are often depicted in films or stories about [[shipwreck]]ed people, and are also used as stereotypes for the idea of \"[[paradise]]\". Some uninhabited islands are protected as [[nature reserve]]s and some are privately owned.

In the latter, the adjective ''[[wikt:desert#Adjective|desert]]'' connotes not [[desert]] climate conditions, but rather \"desolate and sparsely occupied or unoccupied\". The word ''desert'' has been \"formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land\", and it is this archaic meaning that appears in the phrase \"desert island\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{Cite OED|desert island | accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"desert island\" is also commonly used figuratively to refer to objects or behavior in conditions of social isolation and limited material means. Behavior on a desert island is a common [[thought experiment]], for example, \"desert island morality\".<ref name=\"OED\" />\n\n== Biodiversity ==\nThe deserted islands are partly sheltered from human nuisances, making them havens of peace for a number of fragile wildlife species such as sea turtles and ground-nesting seabirds. Many species of seabirds use them as stopovers on their way or especially for nesting, taking advantage of the (supposed) absence of terrestrial predators such as cats or rats.\n\nHowever, the sea accumulates on their beaches tons of waste from far away countries, and the absence of surveillance also makes them important spots for poachers of protected species.<ref name=ducarme>{{cite web | url=https://www.sfecologie.org/regard/r76-nov-2017-f-ducarme-resort-effect/ | accessdate= | title=Les aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 |author=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ducarme | publisher= {{ill|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Ecologie|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9cologie et d'\u00e9volution}} }}</ref>\n\n==List of selected uninhabited islands==\n[[File:LighthouseOnKleinCuracao.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The abandoned lighthouse at [[Klein Cura\u00e7ao]]]]\n\n* [[Appat Island]], [[Greenland]]\n* [[Auckland Islands]] in the South Pacific, which are part of [[New Zealand]]\n* [[Astola Island]], [[Pakistan]]\n* A majority of the [[Barra Isles]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].

In the latter, the adjective ''[[wikt:desert#Adjective|desert]]'' connotes not [[desert]] climate conditions, but rather \"desolate and sparsely occupied or unoccupied\". The word ''desert'' has been \"formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land\", and it is this archaic meaning that appears in the phrase \"desert island\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{Cite OED|desert island | accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"desert island\" is also commonly used figuratively to refer to objects or behavior in conditions of social isolation and limited material means.

Many species of seabirds use them as stopovers on their way or especially for nesting, taking advantage of the (supposed) absence of terrestrial predators such as cats or rats.\n\nHowever, the sea accumulates on their beaches tons of waste from far away countries, and the absence of surveillance also makes them important spots for poachers of protected species.<ref name=ducarme>{{cite web | url=https://www.sfecologie.org/regard/r76-nov-2017-f-ducarme-resort-effect/ | accessdate= | title=Les aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 |author=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ducarme | publisher= {{ill|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Ecologie|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9cologie et d'\u00e9volution}} }}</ref>\n\n==List of selected uninhabited islands==\n[[File:LighthouseOnKleinCuracao.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The abandoned lighthouse at [[Klein Cura\u00e7ao]]]]\n\n* [[Appat Island]], [[Greenland]]\n* [[Auckland Islands]] in the South Pacific, which are part of [[New Zealand]]\n* [[Astola Island]], [[Pakistan]]\n* A majority of the [[Barra Isles]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].

However the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with [[date honey]] and then wash it down with hot tea.

The word ''kaymak'' (''qaymaq'') is also used for the boiled method. ''Qaymaq'' is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''Qaimak'' or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours of stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, packaged qaimak is not as rich as homemade.

After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly [[fermentation (food)|ferment]]) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of [[milk fat]], typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact due to milk protein fibers) and a rich taste.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word kaymak has [[Central Asia]]n [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kaymak|title=kaymak|publisher=Ni\u015fanyanS\u00f6zl\u00fck|language=Turkish|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]''.
