His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]]. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored [[color theory]], writing about it extensively; his lectures ''Writings on Form and Design Theory'' (''Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre''), published in English as the ''[[Paul Klee Notebooks]]'', are held to be as important for modern art as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' for the [[Renaissance]].<ref>Disegno e progettazione By Marcello Petrignani p. 17</ref><ref>[[Guilo Carlo Argan]] \"Preface\", Paul Klee, The Thinking Eye, (ed.

His sister Mathilde (died 6 December 1953) was born on 28 January 1876 in [[Walzenhausen]]. Their father came from [[Tann, Hesse|Tann]] and studied singing, piano, organ and violin at the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Stuttgart Conservatory]], meeting there his future wife Ida Frick. Hans Wilhelm Klee was active as a music teacher at the Bern State Seminary in [[Hofwil]] near Bern until 1931. Klee was able to develop his music skills as his parents encouraged and inspired him throughout his life.<ref>Rudloff, p. 65</ref>\n<!--[[File:Paul Klee 1892.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Paul Klee as schoolboy, 1892]]-->\nIn 1880, his family moved to Bern, where they eventually, in 1897, after a number of changes of residence, moved into their own house in the {{ill|Kirchenfeld, Bern|de|Kirchenfeld (Bern)|lt=Kirchenfeld district}}.<ref>Baumgartner, p. 199</ref> From 1886 to 1890, Klee visited primary school and received, at the age of 7, violin classes at the [[Musikschule Konservatorium Bern|Municipal Music School]].

In the collection of the Klee Foundation, [[Bern, Switzerland]]]]\nIn his early years, following his parents' wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; but he decided on the [[visual arts]] during his teen years, partly out of rebellion and partly because modern music lacked meaning for him. He stated, \"I didn't find the idea of going in for music creatively particularly attractive in view of the decline in the history of musical achievement.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 9\">Partsch, p. 9</ref> As a musician, he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the [[Classical period (music)|eighteenth]] and [[Romantic music|nineteenth]] century, but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 9\"/> At sixteen, Klee's landscape drawings already show considerable skill.<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 54\">Kagan p. 54</ref>\n\nAround 1897, Klee started his diary, which he kept until 1918, and which has provided scholars with valuable insight into his life and thinking.<ref>Partsch, p. 7</ref> During his school years, he avidly drew in his school books, in particular drawing [[caricatures]], and already demonstrating skill with line and volume.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\">Partsch, p. 10</ref> He barely passed his final exams at the \"Gymnasium\" of Bern, where he qualified in the [[Humanities]]. With his characteristic dry wit, he wrote, \"After all, it\u2019s rather difficult to achieve the ''exact'' minimum, and it involves risks.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 22\">Kagan, p. 22</ref> On his own time, in addition to his deep interests in music and art, Klee was a great reader of literature, and later a writer on [[art theory]] and [[aesthetics]].<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\">Jardi, p. 8</ref>\n\nWith his parents' reluctant permission, in 1898 Klee began studying art at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Munich]] with [[Heinrich Knirr]] and [[Franz von Stuck]].  He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense.  He later recalled, \"During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 22\"/> During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\">Partsch, p. 11</ref>\n\nAfter receiving his Fine Arts degree, Klee traveled in Italy from October 1901 to May 1902<ref>Olga's Gallery [http://www.abcgallery.com/K/klee/kleebio.html Paul Klee]</ref> with friend [[Hermann Haller (sculptor)|Hermann Haller]]. They visited in Rome, Florence, Naples and the Amalfi Coast, studying the master painters of past centuries.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/> He exclaimed, \"The [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] have spoken to me.

By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his ''Portrait of My Father'' (1906).<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\"/> In the years 1903\u201305 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate [[etching]]s called ''Inventions'', his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/><ref>''[http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20090418_paul_klee_inventions.html \u201cInvention\u201d Paul Klee at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Francisco]'' ARTinvestment.RU \u2013 18 April 2009</ref> He commented, \"though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go on like this.

They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 12\"/> Klee's art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art.  In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.\n\n=== Affiliation to the \"Blaue Reiter\", 1911 ===\nIn January 1911 [[Alfred Kubin]] met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee's graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors.<ref name=\"Baumgartner207\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''. Michael Baumgartner, Cathrin Klings\u00f6hr-Leroy, Katja Schneider, p. 207</ref> Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911. Klee was a foundation member and manager of the Munich artists' union ''Sema'' that summer.<ref name=\"Verspohl90\">Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl, Jena 1999, p. 90</ref> In autumn he made an acquaintance with [[August Macke]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and in winter he joined the editorial team of the almanac ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'', founded by [[Franz Marc]] and Kandinsky. On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, \"I came to feel a deep trust in him.  He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.\"<ref>Jardi, p. 12</ref> Other members included Macke, [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] and [[Marianne von Werefkin]]. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the ''Blaue Reiter'', but he was not yet fully integrated.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter'', p. 118</ref>\n\nThe release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first ''Blaue Reiter'' exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the [[Hans Goltz|Galerie Goltz]], 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was ''Schwarz-Wei\u00df'', as it only regarded graphic painting.<ref>Dietmar Elger, ''Expressionismus''. 1988, p. 141, {{ISBN|3-8228-0093-7}}</ref> Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the ''Der Blau Reiter'' almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing ''Steinhauer'' by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst''.<ref>Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, volume 1, 1998, p. 512; Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl; ''Paul Klee in Jena 1924.

His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of [[Cubism]] and the pioneering examples of \"pure painting\", an early term for [[abstract art]]. The use of bold color by [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] also inspired him.<ref>Partsch, p. 18</ref> Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including ''In the Quarry'' (1913) and ''Houses near the Gravel Pit'' (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap.<ref>Jardi, plate 7, 9</ref> Klee acknowledged that \"a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color\" in order to reach his \"distant noble aim.\"  Soon, he discovered \"the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\"/>\n\n===Trip to Tunis, 1914===\nKlee's artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with [[August Macke]] and [[Louis Moilliet]] and was impressed by the quality of the light there.  He wrote, \"Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\">Partsch, p. 20</ref> With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the \"cool romanticism of abstraction\".<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called \"operatic paintings\".<ref>Partsch, pp. 24\u201325</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 33</ref> One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is ''The Bavarian Don Giovanni'' (1919).<ref>Kagan, p. 35</ref>\n\nAfter returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, ''In the Style of Kairouan'' (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles.<ref>Partsch, p. 27</ref> The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times \"dissonant\" colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.<ref>Kagan, pp. 27, 29.</ref>\n\n===Military career===\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1916.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Paul Klee as a soldier, 1916]]\nA few weeks later, [[World War I]] began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, \"I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.\"<ref>Partsch, p. 31</ref> Klee was [[conscription|conscripted]] as a ''Landsturmsoldat'' (soldier of the reserve forces in [[Prussia]] or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]] in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink [[lithograph]]s on war themes including ''Death for the Idea'' (1915).<ref>Reproduced alongside Gerg Traki's poem in Zeit-Echo 1915.A reverse [[ekphrasis]].</ref> After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company{{Ref label|fn_2|b|b}} in [[Oberschleissheim]], executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft [[camouflage]], and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in [[Gersthofen]] (which 54 years later became the [[USASA Field Station Augsburg]]) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.<ref name=\"Baumgartner214f\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft'', pp.&nbsp;214&nbsp;et seqq</ref><ref>Partsch, p. 35</ref>\n\nHe continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists.<ref>Partsch, p. 36</ref> His ''[[Ab ovo (painting)|Ab ovo]]'' (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his ''Warning of the Ships'' (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.<ref>Partsch, p. 40</ref>\n\n== Mature career ==\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1922, Red Balloon, oil on chalk-primed gauze, mounted on board, 31.7 x 31.1 cm, Solomon R.

That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists.<ref>Jardi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major [[monograph]] on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.<ref>Jardi, p. 20</ref>\n[[File:Nocturnal Festivity.JPG|thumb|''Nocturnal Festivity'', 1921, The Solomon R.

His ''[[Ad Parnassum (Klee)|Ad Parnassum]]'' (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his [[Pointillism|pointillist style]]; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings.<ref>Partsch, p. 64</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 42</ref> He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany.<ref>Partsch, p. 74</ref> However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as [[scleroderma]] after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso.<ref>Jardi, p. 25</ref> Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year.<ref>Partsch, p. 76</ref> He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others somber, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism.<ref>Partsch, pp. 77\u201380</ref> Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \"[[Degenerate art]]\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.<ref>Partsch, p. 94</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bern Schosshaldenfriedhof Grabstein Paul Klee DSC01491.JPG|left|thumb|Klee's grave in Schosshalden cemetery]]\nKlee suffered from a wasting disease, [[scleroderma]], toward the end of his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, ''[[Death and Fire]]'', features a skull in the center with the German word for death, \"Tod\", appearing in the face. He died in [[Muralto]], Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/ein-berner--aber-kein-schweizer-kuenstler/624962|title=Ein Berner, aber kein Schweizer K\u00fcnstler|last=swissinfo.ch|first=S.

In the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nKlee has been variously associated with [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media\u2014[[oil paint]], [[watercolor]], [[ink]], [[pastel]], [[etching]], and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint.<ref>Kagan, p. 26</ref> Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and [[mixed media]] such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.<ref>Partsch, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nHe was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] to highly [[polychrome|polychromatic]]. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and [[grid format]] compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or [[musical notation]]. The later works are distinguished by spidery [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]-like symbols. [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] wrote about Klee in 1921, \"Even if you hadn\u2019t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.\"<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\"/>\n\nPamela Kort observed: \"Klee's 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his [[aesthetics]] that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of [[parody]] and [[wit]]. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee's art has [[political]] dimensions.\"<ref>[http://www.culturekiosque.com/art/exhibiti/paulklee.html Paul Klee 1933<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.culturekiosque.com</ref>\n\nAmong the few plastic works are [[hand puppet]]s made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix.

The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works ''In den H\u00e4usern von Saint-Germain'' (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and ''Stra\u00dfencaf\u00e9'' (Streetcaf\u00e9). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as ''Abstract'' and ''Farbige Kreise durch Farbb\u00e4nder verbunden'' (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Meisterwerke der Kunst, Isis Verlag|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Paul Klee|accessdate=25 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref> He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Fenster u.

It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:\n\n<blockquote>In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [\u2026] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter''. pp. 118&nbsp;et seq</ref></blockquote>\nUnder the impression of his military service he created the painting ''Trauerblumen'' (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in ''Blumenmythos'' (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.\n\nIn the 1918 watercolor painting ''Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht'', a compositional implemented poem, possible written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. [[Herwarth Walden]], Klee's art dealer, saw in them a \"Wachabl\u00f6sung\" (changing of the guard) of his art.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;41</ref> Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil.

From that period he created ''[[Twittering Machine|Die Zwitscher-Maschine]]'' (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]]. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The \"twittering\" in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the \"machine\" is illustrated by the crank.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=37347 ''The Twittering-Machine''], moma.org, retrieved on 10 January 2011.</ref> [[File:GUGG_In_Angel%27s_Care.jpg|thumb|''In Engelshut,'' 1931, watercolor and colored inks on paper, mounted on paper, [[Solomon R.

The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.<ref>Siglind Bruhn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CEqASxLSQC ''Das t\u00f6nende Museum''], Gorz Verlag 2004, pp.&nbsp;34&nbsp; et seq</ref>\n\nOther examples from that period are ''der Goldfisch'' (The Goldfish) from 1925, ''Katze und Vogel'' (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and ''Hauptweg und Nebenwege'' (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix. The puppets are not mentioned in the Bauhaus catalog of works, since they were intended as private toys from the beginning.<ref name=\"berlin\">{{cite web|title=Paul Klee hinterlie\u00df kunstvolle Handpuppen.

Among these figurations is \"In Engelshut\" (In the Angel's Care). Its overlaying technique evinces the polyphonic character of his drawing method between 1920 and 1932.<ref>Andrew Kagan, ''Paul Klee at the Guggenheim Museum,'' New York: Guggenheim Museum Library, 2003, 41.</ref>\n\nThe 1932 painting ''Ad Parnassum'' was also created in the D\u00fcsseldorf period. {{convert|100|\u00d7|126|cm|in|abbr=on}} This is one of his largest paintings, as he usually worked with small formats. In this mosaic-like work in the style of [[pointillism]] he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the \"[[Parnassus]]\" there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;67</ref> During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian [[Olivier Berggruen]] as a mystical feeling: \"In the desert, the sun's intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.\"<ref>Berggruen, \"Paul Klee \u2013 In Search of Natural Signs\" in ''The Writing of Art'' (London: Pushkin Press, 2011), 63.</ref> In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year\u2014with the programmatic title ''von der Liste gestrichen'' (removed from the list)\u2014provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship. The abstract portrait was painted in dark colors and shows closed eyes and compressed lips, while on the back of his head there is a large \"X\", symbolizing that his art was no longer valued in Germany.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Red Green Architecture yellow violet gradation by Paul Klee.jpeg|''Red/Green Architecture (yellow/violet gradation)'', 1922, oil on canvas on cardboard mat, [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[Yale University]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]]\nFile:Paul Klee, 1922, Senecio, oil on gauze, 40.3 \u00d7 37.4 cm, Kunstmuseum Basel.jpg|''[[Senecio (Klee)|Senecio]]'', 1922, oil on gauze, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], Basel\nFile:GUGG Fright of a Girl.jpg| ''Fright of a Girl'', 1922, Watercolor, India ink and oil transfer drawing on paper, with India ink on paper mount, [[Solomon R.

After the onset of illness, there were about 25 works in the 1936 catalogue, but his productivity increased in 1937 to 264 pictures, 1938 to 489, and 1939\u2014his most productive year\u2014to 1254. They dealt with [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting ''Musiker'' (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the ''Revolution des Viadukts'' (Revolution of the Viadukt), an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] art. In ''Viadukt'' (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;92</ref>\nSince 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting ''[[Insula dulcamara]]'' from the same year, which is one of his largest ({{convert|88|\u00d7|176|cm|in|abbr=on}}), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets. Bitterness and sorrow are not rare in much of his works during this time.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Paul Klee Zeichen in Gelb 1937.jpg|''Zeichen in Gelb'', 1937, pastel on cotton on colored paste on jute on stretcher frame, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen near Basel\nFile:Paul Klee Nach der \u00dcberschwemmung.jpg|''Nach der \u00dcberschwemmung'', 1936, wallpaper glue and watercolors on Ingres paper on cardboard\nFile:Paul Klee, Revolution des Viadukts, 1937.jpg|''Revolution des Viadukts'', 1937, oil on oil grounding on cotton on stretcher frame, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg|Hamburger Kunsthalle]]\nFile:Paul Klee Die Vase.jpg|''Die Vase'', 1938, oil on jute, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen near Basel\nFile:Heroic Roses.JPG|''Heroische Rosen'' (Heroic Roses), 1938, oil on canvas, [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf\nFile:Paul Klee, Insula dulcamara.jpg|''[[Insula dulcamara]]'', 1938, oil color and colored paste on newsprint on jute on stretcher frame, [[Zentrum Paul Klee]], Bern\nFile:Paul Klee, Ohne Titel (Der Todesengel).jpg|''Ohne Titel (Letztes Stillleben)'', 1940, oil on canvas on stretcher frame, Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern\nFile:Death and Fire.JPG|''[[Death and Fire|Tod und Feuer]]'' (Death and Fire), 1940, oil on distemper on jute, Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern\n</gallery></div>\nKlee created in 1940 a picture which strongly differs from the previous works, leaving it unsigned on the scaffold.

His partially morbid motifs appealed to the surrealists. [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] helped to develop the surrealism and renamed Klee's 1912 painting ''Zimmerperspektive mit Einwohnern'' (Room Perspective with People) to ''chambre spirit'' in a catalogue. Critic [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]] called the artist a \"dreamer\" who \"releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.\" Paul Klee's confidante [[Will Grohmann]] argued in the ''Cahiers d'art'' that he \"stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.\" Whereupon Breton, as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] remembers, was critical of Klee: \"Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him.

In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn's anthology were presented at the National Socialist [[propaganda]] exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\" in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], Klee, [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]] and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|title=Sammlung Prinzhorn der Psychiatrischen Universit\u00e4tsklinik Heidelberg|publisher=St\u00e4dtische Museen Jena|language=German|accessdate=2 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101223320/http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 [[Marcel Duchamp]] commented on Paul Klee: \"The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [\u2026] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became an other Klee.\"<ref name=\"Herbert376\">Robert L.

By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his ''Portrait of My Father'' (1906).<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\"/> In the years 1903\u201305 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate [[etching]]s called ''Inventions'', his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/><ref>''[http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20090418_paul_klee_inventions.html \u201cInvention\u201d Paul Klee at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Francisco]'' ARTinvestment.RU \u2013 18 April 2009</ref> He commented, \"though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go on like this.

They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 12\"/> Klee's art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art.  In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.\n\n=== Affiliation to the \"Blaue Reiter\", 1911 ===\nIn January 1911 [[Alfred Kubin]] met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee's graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors.<ref name=\"Baumgartner207\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''. Michael Baumgartner, Cathrin Klings\u00f6hr-Leroy, Katja Schneider, p. 207</ref> Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911. Klee was a foundation member and manager of the Munich artists' union ''Sema'' that summer.<ref name=\"Verspohl90\">Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl, Jena 1999, p. 90</ref> In autumn he made an acquaintance with [[August Macke]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and in winter he joined the editorial team of the almanac ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'', founded by [[Franz Marc]] and Kandinsky. On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, \"I came to feel a deep trust in him.  He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.\"<ref>Jardi, p. 12</ref> Other members included Macke, [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] and [[Marianne von Werefkin]]. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the ''Blaue Reiter'', but he was not yet fully integrated.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter'', p. 118</ref>\n\nThe release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first ''Blaue Reiter'' exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the [[Hans Goltz|Galerie Goltz]], 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was ''Schwarz-Wei\u00df'', as it only regarded graphic painting.<ref>Dietmar Elger, ''Expressionismus''. 1988, p. 141, {{ISBN|3-8228-0093-7}}</ref> Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the ''Der Blau Reiter'' almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing ''Steinhauer'' by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst''.<ref>Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, volume 1, 1998, p. 512; Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl; ''Paul Klee in Jena 1924.

His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of [[Cubism]] and the pioneering examples of \"pure painting\", an early term for [[abstract art]]. The use of bold color by [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] also inspired him.<ref>Partsch, p. 18</ref> Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including ''In the Quarry'' (1913) and ''Houses near the Gravel Pit'' (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap.<ref>Jardi, plate 7, 9</ref> Klee acknowledged that \"a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color\" in order to reach his \"distant noble aim.\"  Soon, he discovered \"the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\"/>\n\n===Trip to Tunis, 1914===\nKlee's artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with [[August Macke]] and [[Louis Moilliet]] and was impressed by the quality of the light there.  He wrote, \"Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\">Partsch, p. 20</ref> With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the \"cool romanticism of abstraction\".<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called \"operatic paintings\".<ref>Partsch, pp. 24\u201325</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 33</ref> One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is ''The Bavarian Don Giovanni'' (1919).<ref>Kagan, p. 35</ref>\n\nAfter returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, ''In the Style of Kairouan'' (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles.<ref>Partsch, p. 27</ref> The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times \"dissonant\" colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.<ref>Kagan, pp. 27, 29.</ref>\n\n===Military career===\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1916.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Paul Klee as a soldier, 1916]]\nA few weeks later, [[World War I]] began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, \"I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.\"<ref>Partsch, p. 31</ref> Klee was [[conscription|conscripted]] as a ''Landsturmsoldat'' (soldier of the reserve forces in [[Prussia]] or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]] in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink [[lithograph]]s on war themes including ''Death for the Idea'' (1915).<ref>Reproduced alongside Gerg Traki's poem in Zeit-Echo 1915.A reverse [[ekphrasis]].</ref> After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company{{Ref label|fn_2|b|b}} in [[Oberschleissheim]], executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft [[camouflage]], and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in [[Gersthofen]] (which 54 years later became the [[USASA Field Station Augsburg]]) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.<ref name=\"Baumgartner214f\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft'', pp.&nbsp;214&nbsp;et seqq</ref><ref>Partsch, p. 35</ref>\n\nHe continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists.<ref>Partsch, p. 36</ref> His ''[[Ab ovo (painting)|Ab ovo]]'' (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his ''Warning of the Ships'' (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.<ref>Partsch, p. 40</ref>\n\n== Mature career ==\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1922, Red Balloon, oil on chalk-primed gauze, mounted on board, 31.7 x 31.1 cm, Solomon R.

That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists.<ref>Jardi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major [[monograph]] on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.<ref>Jardi, p. 20</ref>\n[[File:Nocturnal Festivity.JPG|thumb|''Nocturnal Festivity'', 1921, The Solomon R.

His ''[[Ad Parnassum (Klee)|Ad Parnassum]]'' (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his [[Pointillism|pointillist style]]; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings.<ref>Partsch, p. 64</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 42</ref> He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany.<ref>Partsch, p. 74</ref> However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as [[scleroderma]] after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso.<ref>Jardi, p. 25</ref> Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year.<ref>Partsch, p. 76</ref> He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others somber, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism.<ref>Partsch, pp. 77\u201380</ref> Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \"[[Degenerate art]]\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.<ref>Partsch, p. 94</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bern Schosshaldenfriedhof Grabstein Paul Klee DSC01491.JPG|left|thumb|Klee's grave in Schosshalden cemetery]]\nKlee suffered from a wasting disease, [[scleroderma]], toward the end of his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, ''[[Death and Fire]]'', features a skull in the center with the German word for death, \"Tod\", appearing in the face. He died in [[Muralto]], Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/ein-berner--aber-kein-schweizer-kuenstler/624962|title=Ein Berner, aber kein Schweizer K\u00fcnstler|last=swissinfo.ch|first=S.

In the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nKlee has been variously associated with [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media\u2014[[oil paint]], [[watercolor]], [[ink]], [[pastel]], [[etching]], and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint.<ref>Kagan, p. 26</ref> Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and [[mixed media]] such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.<ref>Partsch, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nHe was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] to highly [[polychrome|polychromatic]]. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and [[grid format]] compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or [[musical notation]]. The later works are distinguished by spidery [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]-like symbols. [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] wrote about Klee in 1921, \"Even if you hadn\u2019t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.\"<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\"/>\n\nPamela Kort observed: \"Klee's 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his [[aesthetics]] that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of [[parody]] and [[wit]]. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee's art has [[political]] dimensions.\"<ref>[http://www.culturekiosque.com/art/exhibiti/paulklee.html Paul Klee 1933<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.culturekiosque.com</ref>\n\nAmong the few plastic works are [[hand puppet]]s made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix.

The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works ''In den H\u00e4usern von Saint-Germain'' (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and ''Stra\u00dfencaf\u00e9'' (Streetcaf\u00e9). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as ''Abstract'' and ''Farbige Kreise durch Farbb\u00e4nder verbunden'' (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Meisterwerke der Kunst, Isis Verlag|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Paul Klee|accessdate=25 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref> He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Fenster u.

It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:\n\n<blockquote>In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [\u2026] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter''. pp. 118&nbsp;et seq</ref></blockquote>\nUnder the impression of his military service he created the painting ''Trauerblumen'' (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in ''Blumenmythos'' (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.\n\nIn the 1918 watercolor painting ''Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht'', a compositional implemented poem, possible written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other.

From that period he created ''[[Twittering Machine|Die Zwitscher-Maschine]]'' (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]]. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The \"twittering\" in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the \"machine\" is illustrated by the crank.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=37347 ''The Twittering-Machine''], moma.org, retrieved on 10 January 2011.</ref> [[File:GUGG_In_Angel%27s_Care.jpg|thumb|''In Engelshut,'' 1931, watercolor and colored inks on paper, mounted on paper, [[Solomon R.

The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.<ref>Siglind Bruhn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CEqASxLSQC ''Das t\u00f6nende Museum''], Gorz Verlag 2004, pp.&nbsp;34&nbsp; et seq</ref>\n\nOther examples from that period are ''der Goldfisch'' (The Goldfish) from 1925, ''Katze und Vogel'' (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and ''Hauptweg und Nebenwege'' (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix.

Among these figurations is \"In Engelshut\" (In the Angel's Care).

In this mosaic-like work in the style of [[pointillism]] he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the \"[[Parnassus]]\" there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;67</ref> During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian [[Olivier Berggruen]] as a mystical feeling: \"In the desert, the sun's intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.\"<ref>Berggruen, \"Paul Klee \u2013 In Search of Natural Signs\" in ''The Writing of Art'' (London: Pushkin Press, 2011), 63.</ref> In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year\u2014with the programmatic title ''von der Liste gestrichen'' (removed from the list)\u2014provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship. The abstract portrait was painted in dark colors and shows closed eyes and compressed lips, while on the back of his head there is a large \"X\", symbolizing that his art was no longer valued in Germany.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Red Green Architecture yellow violet gradation by Paul Klee.jpeg|''Red/Green Architecture (yellow/violet gradation)'', 1922, oil on canvas on cardboard mat, [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[Yale University]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]]\nFile:Paul Klee, 1922, Senecio, oil on gauze, 40.3 \u00d7 37.4 cm, Kunstmuseum Basel.jpg|''[[Senecio (Klee)|Senecio]]'', 1922, oil on gauze, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], Basel\nFile:GUGG Fright of a Girl.jpg| ''Fright of a Girl'', 1922, Watercolor, India ink and oil transfer drawing on paper, with India ink on paper mount, [[Solomon R.

After the onset of illness, there were about 25 works in the 1936 catalogue, but his productivity increased in 1937 to 264 pictures, 1938 to 489, and 1939\u2014his most productive year\u2014to 1254. They dealt with [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting ''Musiker'' (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the ''Revolution des Viadukts'' (Revolution of the Viadukt), an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] art. In ''Viadukt'' (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;92</ref>\nSince 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting ''[[Insula dulcamara]]'' from the same year, which is one of his largest ({{convert|88|\u00d7|176|cm|in|abbr=on}}), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets.

His partially morbid motifs appealed to the surrealists. [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] helped to develop the surrealism and renamed Klee's 1912 painting ''Zimmerperspektive mit Einwohnern'' (Room Perspective with People) to ''chambre spirit'' in a catalogue. Critic [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]] called the artist a \"dreamer\" who \"releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.\" Paul Klee's confidante [[Will Grohmann]] argued in the ''Cahiers d'art'' that he \"stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.\" Whereupon Breton, as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] remembers, was critical of Klee: \"Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him. But Breton despises him.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Catrin Lorch|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=4 January 2007|url=http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714133553/http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archivedate=14 July 2011|title=Klees feine kleine Klumpgeister|language=German|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe art of mentally ill people inspired Klee as well as Kandinsky and Max Ernst, after [[Hans Prinzhorn]]s book ''Bildnerei der Geisteskranken'' (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) was published in 1922. In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn's anthology were presented at the National Socialist [[propaganda]] exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\" in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], Klee, [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]] and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|title=Sammlung Prinzhorn der Psychiatrischen Universit\u00e4tsklinik Heidelberg|publisher=St\u00e4dtische Museen Jena|language=German|accessdate=2 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101223320/http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 [[Marcel Duchamp]] commented on Paul Klee: \"The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [\u2026] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became an other Klee.\"<ref name=\"Herbert376\">Robert L.

In his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" Benjamin suggests that the angel depicted in the painting might be seen as representing the angel of history.\n\nAnother aspect of his legacy, and one demonstrating his multi-faceted presence in the modern artistic imagination, is his appeal for those interested in the history of the algorithm as exemplified by ''Homage to Paul Klee'' by computer art pioneer Frieder Nake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/8/2/69|author=Smith, Glenn|date=31 May 2019|title=An Interview with Frieder Nake|publisher=Arts|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical interpretations ===\n[[File:Paul Klee Zentrum.jpg|thumb|[[Zentrum Paul Klee]] in Bern, Switzerland, designed by [[Renzo Piano]]]]\nUnlike his taste for adventurous modern experiment in painting, Klee, though musically talented, was attracted to older traditions of music; he neither appreciated composers of the late 19th century, such as [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], nor contemporary music.

Swiss law determined citizenship along paternal lines, and thus Paul inherited his father's German citizenship. He served in the German army during World War I. Klee grew up in Berne, Switzerland, and returned there often, even before his final emigration from Germany in 1933. He died before his application for Swiss citizenship was processed.<ref name=\"fayal\">Fayal, M.: ''[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Specials/Paul_Klee/The_man/A_man_made_in_Switzerland.html?cid=124180 Paul Klee: A man made in Switzerland]'', swissinfo, 25 May 2005.
