He worked in Cincinnati as a machinist before relocating to New Ulm with other members of the [[Turner Society]]. Upon moving to New Ulm, building on his experience as a machinist, he established a mill. In 1860, August Schell partnered with Jacob Bernhardt to found a brewery to serve the growing German immigrant population in the area. August and Jacob selected a site two miles from the heart of New Ulm along the Cottonwood River. While much of the city of New Ulm was damaged or burned during the [[Dakota War]] of 1865, the brewery escaped intact. In 1866, August Schell bought out his partner Jacob Bernahrdt to take sole ownership of the brewery, starting an unbroken chain of family ownership that continues to this day. During this time, the brewery grew in size and production.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134753/http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |archive-date=2018-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAugust Schell died in 1891 leaving the brewery to his wife Theresa. Their son Otto took over managing the brewery. Otto had studied brewing back in the Schells' home country of Germany. As the 19th century became the 20th, Otto continued to modernize the brewery by adding refrigeration to the brewery. 1911 was a tragic year for the Schell family as first Otto and then Theresa died. At that time, George Marti, the husband of August's daughter Emma, took over managing and operating the brewery.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\n1919 brought about the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and implementation of [[Prohibition]]. The August Schell Brewing Company struggled along with many other American breweries. The brewery transitioned to producing \"near-beer\" (a low alcohol beer still permitted during Prohibition), soft drinks, and candy. Prohibition ended in 1933 with passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. George Marti had successfully steered the brewery through Prohibition, but died shortly thereafter in 1934.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nGeorge's son Alfred (\"Al\") Marti became the President and Manager of the brewery upon the death of his father. Al ran the brewery until 1969 until he retired and passed leadership of the company to his son Warren Marti. During this time, the brewing industry was going through a period of consolidation and upheaval, and Schell's was not immune. At one point, the brewery only managed to keep its doors open by cutting down a large black walnut tree located on the grounds of the brewery and sold its lumber. During Warren's tenure, the brewery responded to its customers changing preferences by introducing Schell's Export Beer, Schell's Light Beer, and 1919 Root Beer (named after the year prohibition was implemented).<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Warren's son Ted Marti took over operations of the brewery and became President of the brewery in 1985. Having studied at the [[Siebels Institute of Brewing]], Ted began expanding the line of beers offered by the Schell's Brewery. One of those beers, Schell's Pilsener, earned a gold medal at the [[Great American Beer Festival]] in 1988. Schell's continued to expand its beer offerings through the 1990s, brewing 38 different beers over that decade.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Schell's Brewery expanded its reach by acquiring the recipe and branding for [[Grain Belt Beer]]. Upon moving production to its New Ulm Brewery, Schell's introduced additional Grain Belt varieties including Grain Belt Nordeast in 2010, Grain Belt Lock & Dam in 2016 (since retired), Grain Belt BLU in 2018 (after appearing at the Minnesota State Fair for several years), and Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza in 2019.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe next generation of the Marti family is increasing its involvement in the management and operation of the brewery. Ted's oldest son Jace Marti became a brewmaster in 2010 and has taken the lead on producing Schell's Noble Star line of sour Berliner Weisse beers. The brewery opened the Starkeller facility on the North side of New Ulm to produce the Noble Star line. This facility also houses a tap room dedicated to these sour ales.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe brewery has continued to update its offerings by retiring long time brews such as Maifest, Schmaltz's Alt, and Pils among others, while adding and IPA, a Kolsch and Cream Ale. In 2020, it is expected that the brewery will release a line of hard seltzers as Grain Belt N'icebreakers as well as a low calorie Grain Belt Elite. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nujournal.com/news/local-news/2020/02/27/schells-releasing-new-products-buying-new-equipment/ |title=Schell's Releasing New Products, Buying New Equipment |publisher=New Ulm Journal |date=2020-02-27 |accessdate=2020-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Brewery ==\nThe historic Schell's brewery is located in New Ulm, Minnesota alongside the Cottonwood River. The brewery has grown and evolved over the decades to accommodate new technology and expanded production lines. In addition to serving as a production facility, the brewery grounds house the historic Schell's mansion, a gift shop, a beer garden, and a deer enclosure. The grounds are open to visitors with tours running out of the gift shop. [[Peafowl]] live on the grounds and are free to roam the property.\n\n== Events ==\nThe August Schell Brewing Company hosts annual Oktoberfest and Bock Fest celebrations on the grounds of the historic Schell's brewery. Oktoberfest, usually held in early October, features a large fest style tent where the Schell's hobo band plays and the Oktoberfest keg is tapped. Bock Fest, held in late February or early March, features a hunt for Bock beers hidden on the grounds of the brewery and nearby Flandrau State Park. Large fire pits are spread throughout the brewery grounds where attendees can have their beers poked with a hot iron. To highlight and celebrate the sour beers produced under its Starkeller label, an annual event called Funk Junction is held at the Starkeller brewery featuring sour and \"funky\" beer from breweries across the United States.\n\n==Contemporary Beer==\n\n===Year-round Brews===\n* '''Original ''(aka Deer Brand)''''', ''ABV 4.8%'', Straw colored classic American lager.

They are available for roughly six months. \n* '''Fort Road Porter''', ''ABV 4.8%'',  Chocolate and caramel notes shine through this brew, but leaving room for the roasted malts to make their appearance. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the colder months, opposite Fort Road Blonde (formerly ran opposite Fort Road Helles).\n* '''Fort Road Blonde''', Debuting in 2020, this kolsch style ale replaced the Fort Road Helles. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the warmer months, opposite Fort Road Porter.\n* '''Goosetown''', ''ABV 4.7%'', Schell's interpretation of a German-style [[gose]] spiced with coriander and salt.\n* '''Sangria''', ''ABV 4.7%'', a sweet red citrus [[lager]] full of fruity flavor.\n\n===Seasonal Brews===\n[[Seasonal beer]]s include:\n* '''Bock''', ''ABV 5.8%'', Brewed with a harmonious blend of 10 different types of malt and noble hops, Schell's Bock is fermented slowly, and then lagered for an extended period of time to ensure a smooth finish. This dark amber colored beer sports a robust malt character.\n* '''Hefeweizen''', ''ABV 4.4%'', First brewed in 1984, Schell's Hefeweizen is made with a blend of wheat malt and barley malts. We use an authentic wheat beer yeast culture, which gives the beer a fruity ale character dominated by a citrus-like tartness. Refreshingly light character with a higher than normal carbonation level. Straw-colored and cloudy from the unfiltered yeast left in suspension. Notes of banana and clove with a slight bready malt flavor.\n* '''Grain Belt BLU''', ''ABV 4.6%'', A refreshing twist on a classic; Grain Belt Premium is brewed with a generous portion of blueberries to create a light, balanced, and sweet beer.\n* '''Oktoberfest''', ''ABV 5.5%'', With its bright copper-orange color, it is quite symbolic of the autumnal shift of the season.  A slightly higher strength, and warm malt body make it the perfect companion for the crisp fall weather in Minnesota.  The use of Munich and Vienna malts give the beer its toasty malt backbone, and melanoidin-rich flavor and aroma.  It has a soft malt sweetness, pleasant mouthfeel and a slight spiciness.  Hop character is subdued, as the malt takes center stage with this beer.\n* '''Snowstorm''', ''ABV NA'', Flavor changes yearly, see below for a list of past flavors.\n\n===Minnesota State Fair Brews===\nGrain Belt BLU and Schell's Sangria started as beer available exclusively at the [[Minnesota State Fair]], available with or without a frozen slushie on top. Both beers have since been canned and made available throughout Schell's distribution area. In 2018, Schell's released the Starkeller sour beer Two to Tango, Three to Mango at the Minnesota State Fair where is was exclusively available. This was followed up in 2019 with the Minnesota State Fair exclusive Berry Go Round Sour, available at Lulu's Public House at the State Fair. \n\n===Noble Star Collection===\nA collection of specialty beers, all Berlin-style wheat beers or Berliner Weisse, aged in rare cypress fermentation tanks Schell's bought in 1936.

Expect an interesting mix of fruity flavors reminiscent of ripe lemons and apple juice with a touch of spice and a subtle brett character.\n* '''Framboise Du Nord''', ''ABV 3.7%'',  Neon red in color with a slight haze and a large creamy pink foam head. This beer is rather light on the palate and very dry. A lively carbonation accentuates the refreshingly tart acidity and a full raspberry flavor with a subtle hint of brett character.\n* '''North Country Br\u00fcnette''', ''ABV 5.4%'',  The long, slow, secondary fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture to work on the residual sugars that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile. North Country Br\u00fcnette is very tart and dry, with a fine, rounded acidic profile, and a malty, spiced fruity character. This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.\n* '''Black Forest Cherry''', ''ABV 5.1%'',  The maltiness of Black Forest Cherry provides a platform for the tart red cherries to shine through with a highly acidic and fruity character.

Dusty crimson red in color, a tart cherry aroma emanates from the glass atop an underlying spice. A moderate acidity showcases the cherry tang and almond flavors that mingle together, balancing over a toasty malt backbone, and finishing with a lingering sour, yet sweet, cherry zest.\n* '''Astral Fusion''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Astral Fusion is a mixed-culture Berliner Weisse that was aged for a year in our 80-year-old cypress wood lagering tanks before being transferred onto mangos for an additional three months, and then blended with a portion of raspberry Berliner Weisse before being bottled. The resulting beer is quite tart, bursting with a fruity blend of tropical stone fruit with a hint of raspberries on top of a lemony base acidity.\n* '''Static Transmission''', ''ABV 7%'', Static Transmission pours a hazy gold in color and is bursting with the aromas of fresh wildflowers, lemons and pineapple. Oats lend a rich, creamy mouthfeel over a bright, sweet and sour character. This is the first of the Noble Star line of beers to be released in smaller, 375 ml bottles.\n\n===Grain Belt N'icebreakers===\nUnder its Grain Belt brand, the brewery is releasing hard seltzers in 2020 branded as \"N'icebreakers.\" Samples were served at the 2020 Bockfest celebration, and available flavors include Prickly Pear + Guava.\n\n==Shift Happens Miniseries==\nA \"transitional miniseries in four parts,\" this limited 2020 collection of beers celebrates the 160th anniversary of the brewery.\n* '''Shift Happens No. 1''', ''ABV 9%'', a double dry hopped lager with Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook, and Amarillo hops.

This has evolved to include not beers sold in standalone six packs under the Stag Series label, but also those only available in seasonal variety packs.\n\n===Standalone Stag Series===\n* '''Stag Series #1- Barrel Aged Schmaltz Alt''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Aged in Red Wine Barrels\n*'''Stag Series #2''' '''- Wild Rice Farmhouse Ale'''. The second release in the Stag Series is August Schell's interpretation of a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale. This Farmhouse Ale exhibits an earthy/nutty character due to the generous use of Minnesota Wild Rice, the State Grain of Minnesota. The Wild Rice is combined with 2-Row, Munich, Vienna, and a touch of Rye malt to create a complementary backbone to the unique fermentation characteristics of the yeast.  Dry and thirst quenching, this Farmhouse Ale is hopped with Goldings\n*'''Stag Series #3- Rauchbier'''. A blend of malts smoked over beechwood and cherrywood to create a twist on the traditional style. The remainder of the malt bill includes Dark Munich Malt, Caramunich, and a touch of black malt for color. It is hopped with Tettnang and Sterling.\n*'''Stag Series #4- Burton Ale'''. Schell's Burton Ale is a nod to a forgotten style of beer.  Using traditional floor malted Fawcett Maris Otter as a base, the malt bill also includes torrified wheat and two different British Crystal malts.  As is traditional for British brewers, we added sugar in the kettle, in our case turbinado and some Dark Candi Syrup.  Old Burton Extra is hopped with Nugget and Goldings, fermented with a British ale yeast, dry-hopped, and aged for 3 months prior to release.\n*'''Stag Series #5- Czech Dark Lager'''. Modeled after the famous dark lagers of Bohemia. Dark bread and caramel flavors that are accentuated by a decoction mash, and balanced by the spicy Saaz hops.\n*'''Stag Series #6- Fresh Hop Citra Pils.''' Pilsner brewed with fresh Citra Hop cones\n*'''Stag Series #7- Barleywine''' Two separate mashes of 6,000 pounds of malt and 150 pounds of hops were used to brew this intensely malty and assertively hopped American Barleywine Style Ale.\n*'''Stag Series #8- August's Bock'''. Collaboration with Gold Ochsen Brauerei in New Ulm's sister city, Ulm Germany. Both cities are also host to fifth generation family-owned breweries and both breweries were founded by men named August. Working in collaboration, we decided to brew a Blonde Doppel Bock. Both breweries uses specialty malts from Weyerman with each brewery using their own base Pilsner malt \u2013 Rahr for Schell's and Schwabenmalz for Gold Ochsen. Both breweries use Emerald, Tattnanger and Saphir hops during the boil and then each brewery uses a different newer German hop variety in the whirlpool and as a dry hop. Schell's uses Polaris hops and Gold Ochsen uses Mandarina Bavaria. Both beer are then fermented with the respective brewries\u2019 house lager yeast and matured for a couple of months before packaging\n*'''Stag Series #9- Cave Aged Barrel Aged Lager'''. A dark lager aged in American whiskey barrels stored in the brewery's original, underground lagering caves. Located below the historic brewery, the naturally cooled caverns were originally constructed in the 1860s to facilitate brewing in an era that predated electrical refrigeration. Dark brown to black in color, the beer has roasted malt notes of dark chocolate, toffee, light oak, char and a hint of vanilla.\n* '''Stag Series #10 Tropical Stout''', ''ABV 8.5%'', Caribbean Style Stout \n* '''Stag Series #11 Bananas Foster Weizenbock''', ''ABV 8.14%'',  A robust wheat ale with light cinnamon flavors layered over hints of banana, clove, and caramel.\n*'''Stag Series #12 1879 Kulmbacher Export''', Based on a recipe dated back in 1879 from upper Franconia, this dark, hoppy lager was a favorite that was often imitated by many breweries. As trends changed, the popularity of this style brew faded quickly and is unfamiliar to today's beer drinkers. Bock-like in strength, it asserts its dark color and pronounced hop bitterness.\n*'''Stag Series #13. It's All Relative''', ''ABV 7.0%'', Franconian Dopple Bock brewed in collaboration with [[Wagner Brauerei]] in Germany, this malty lager has a deep amber color and lightly hopped with a hint of smoke.\n* '''Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged''', ''ABV 10.89%'', Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged lager, a [[Baltic Porter]], is released each fall after spending time aging in the historic caves deep below the brewery. High in alcohol content with hints of sweet caramel, oak, and vanilla.\n\n===Variety Pack Brews===\n* '''Weiss Beer''', ''ABV NA'', available in the 2016 Biergarten in a Box (summer variety pack).

In September 2010, the brewery celebrated its 150th Anniversary with a two-day festival. Every year, Schell's also celebrates traditional German holidays with Bock Fest and Oktoberfest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schellsbrewery.com/newsevents_info.php?id=42 |title=August Schell Brewing Company: Since 1860 |publisher=Schellsbrewery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930063158/http://www.schellsbrewery.com/newsevents_info.php?id=42 |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The current brewery is owned and operated by the August Schell Brewing Company, a Minnesota corporation that was incorporated in 1902. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=b6bb372b-a8d4-e011-a886-001ec94ffe7f |title=Minnesota Secretary of State: Business Filing Details |publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State |date= |accessdate=2020-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAugust Schell (February 15, 1828, in [[Durbach]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] \u2013 September 20, 1891, in [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]], Minnesota) emigrated to the United States in 1848. He worked in Cincinnati as a machinist before relocating to New Ulm with other members of the [[Turner Society]]. Upon moving to New Ulm, building on his experience as a machinist, he established a mill. In 1860, August Schell partnered with Jacob Bernhardt to found a brewery to serve the growing German immigrant population in the area. August and Jacob selected a site two miles from the heart of New Ulm along the Cottonwood River. While much of the city of New Ulm was damaged or burned during the [[Dakota War]] of 1865, the brewery escaped intact. In 1866, August Schell bought out his partner Jacob Bernahrdt to take sole ownership of the brewery, starting an unbroken chain of family ownership that continues to this day. During this time, the brewery grew in size and production.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134753/http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |archive-date=2018-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAugust Schell died in 1891 leaving the brewery to his wife Theresa. Their son Otto took over managing the brewery. Otto had studied brewing back in the Schells' home country of Germany. As the 19th century became the 20th, Otto continued to modernize the brewery by adding refrigeration to the brewery. 1911 was a tragic year for the Schell family as first Otto and then Theresa died. At that time, George Marti, the husband of August's daughter Emma, took over managing and operating the brewery.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\n1919 brought about the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and implementation of [[Prohibition]]. The August Schell Brewing Company struggled along with many other American breweries. The brewery transitioned to producing \"near-beer\" (a low alcohol beer still permitted during Prohibition), soft drinks, and candy. Prohibition ended in 1933 with passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. George Marti had successfully steered the brewery through Prohibition, but died shortly thereafter in 1934.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nGeorge's son Alfred (\"Al\") Marti became the President and Manager of the brewery upon the death of his father. Al ran the brewery until 1969 until he retired and passed leadership of the company to his son Warren Marti. During this time, the brewing industry was going through a period of consolidation and upheaval, and Schell's was not immune. At one point, the brewery only managed to keep its doors open by cutting down a large black walnut tree located on the grounds of the brewery and sold its lumber. During Warren's tenure, the brewery responded to its customers changing preferences by introducing Schell's Export Beer, Schell's Light Beer, and 1919 Root Beer (named after the year prohibition was implemented).<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Warren's son Ted Marti took over operations of the brewery and became President of the brewery in 1985. Having studied at the [[Siebels Institute of Brewing]], Ted began expanding the line of beers offered by the Schell's Brewery. One of those beers, Schell's Pilsener, earned a gold medal at the [[Great American Beer Festival]] in 1988. Schell's continued to expand its beer offerings through the 1990s, brewing 38 different beers over that decade.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Schell's Brewery expanded its reach by acquiring the recipe and branding for [[Grain Belt Beer]]. Upon moving production to its New Ulm Brewery, Schell's introduced additional Grain Belt varieties including Grain Belt Nordeast in 2010, Grain Belt Lock & Dam in 2016 (since retired), Grain Belt BLU in 2018 (after appearing at the Minnesota State Fair for several years), and Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza in 2019.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe next generation of the Marti family is increasing its involvement in the management and operation of the brewery. Ted's oldest son Jace Marti became a brewmaster in 2010 and has taken the lead on producing Schell's Noble Star line of sour Berliner Weisse beers. The brewery opened the Starkeller facility on the North side of New Ulm to produce the Noble Star line. This facility also houses a tap room dedicated to these sour ales.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe brewery has continued to update its offering retiring long time brews such as Maifest, Schmaltz's Alt, and Pils among others, while adding and IPA, a Kolsch and Cream Ale. In 2020, it is expected that the brewery will release a line of hard seltzers as Grain Belt N'icebreakers as well as a low calorie Grain Belt Elite. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nujournal.com/news/local-news/2020/02/27/schells-releasing-new-products-buying-new-equipment/ |title=Schell's Releasing New Products, Buying New Equipment |publisher=New Ulm Journal |date=2020-02-27 |accessdate=2020-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Brewery ==\nThe historic Schell's brewery is located in New Ulm, Minnesota alongside the Cottonwood River. The brewery has grown and evolved over the decades to accommodate new technology and expanded production lines. In addition to serving as a production facility, the brewery grounds house the historic Schell's mansion, a gift shop, a beer garden, and a deer enclosure. The grounds are open to visitors with tours running out of the gift shop. [[Peafowl]] live on the grounds and are free to roam the property.\n\n== Events ==\nThe August Schell Brewing Company hosts annual Oktoberfest and Bock Fest celebrations on the grounds of the historic Schell's brewery. Oktoberfest, usually held in early October, features a large fest style tent where the Schell's hobo band plays and the Oktoberfest keg is tapped. Bock Fest, held in late February or early March, features a hunt for Bock beers hidden on the grounds of the brewery and nearby Flandrau State Park. Large fire pits are spread throughout the brewery grounds where attendees can have their beers poked with a hot iron. To highlight and celebrate the sour beers produced under its Starkeller label, an annual event called Funk Junction is held at the Starkeller brewery featuring sour and \"funky\" beer from breweries across the United States.\n\n==Contemporary Beer==\n\n===Year-round Brews===\n* '''Original ''(aka Deer Brand)''''', ''ABV 4.8%'', Straw colored classic American lager.

This easy-drinking lager puts a twist on the friendly beer with its subtle lime flavor.\n\n===Extended Seasonal Brews===\nThese beers are available longer than Schell's other seasonal beers. They are available for roughly six months. \n* '''Fort Road Porter''', ''ABV 4.8%'',  Chocolate and caramel notes shine through this brew, but leaving room for the roasted malts to make their appearance. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the colder months, opposite Fort Road Blonde (formerly ran opposite Fort Road Helles).\n* '''Fort Road Blonde''', Debuting in 2020, this kolsch style ale replaced the Fort Road Helles. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the warmer months, opposite Fort Road Porter.\n* '''Goosetown''', ''ABV 4.7%'', Schell's interpretation of a German-style [[gose]] spiced with coriander and salt.\n* '''Sangria''', ''ABV 4.7%'', a sweet red citrus [[lager]] full of fruity flavor.\n\n===Seasonal Brews===\n[[Seasonal beer]]s include:\n* '''Bock''', ''ABV 5.8%'', Brewed with a harmonious blend of 10 different types of malt and noble hops, Schell's Bock is fermented slowly, and then lagered for an extended period of time to ensure a smooth finish. This dark amber colored beer sports a robust malt character.\n* '''Hefeweizen''', ''ABV 4.4%'', First brewed in 1984, Schell's Hefeweizen is made with a blend of wheat malt and barley malts. We use an authentic wheat beer yeast culture, which gives the beer a fruity ale character dominated by a citrus-like tartness. Refreshingly light character with a higher than normal carbonation level. Straw-colored and cloudy from the unfiltered yeast left in suspension. Notes of banana and clove with a slight bready malt flavor.\n* '''Grain Belt BLU''', ''ABV 4.6%'', A refreshing twist on a classic; Grain Belt Premium is brewed with a generous portion of blueberries to create a light, balanced, and sweet beer.\n* '''Oktoberfest''', ''ABV 5.5%'', With its bright copper-orange color, it is quite symbolic of the autumnal shift of the season.  A slightly higher strength, and warm malt body make it the perfect companion for the crisp fall weather in Minnesota.  The use of Munich and Vienna malts give the beer its toasty malt backbone, and melanoidin-rich flavor and aroma.  It has a soft malt sweetness, pleasant mouthfeel and a slight spiciness.  Hop character is subdued, as the malt takes center stage with this beer.\n* '''Snowstorm''', ''ABV NA'', Flavor changes yearly, see below for a list of past flavors.\n\n===Minnesota State Fair Brews===\nGrain Belt BLU and Schell's Sangria started as beer available exclusively at the [[Minnesota State Fair]], available with or without a frozen slushie on top. Both beers have since been canned and made available throughout Schell's distribution area. In 2018, Schell's released the Starkeller sour beer Two to Tango, Three to Mango at the Minnesota State Fair where is was exclusively available. This was followed up in 2019 with the Minnesota State Fair exclusive Berry Go Round Sour, available at Lulu's Public House at the State Fair. \n\n===Noble Star Collection===\nA collection of specialty beers, all Berlin-style wheat beers or Berliner Weisse, aged in rare cypress fermentation tanks Schell's bought in 1936.

This beer is rather light on the palate and very dry. A lively carbonation accentuates the refreshingly tart acidity and a full raspberry flavor with a subtle hint of brett character.\n* '''North Country Br\u00fcnette''', ''ABV 5.4%'',  The long, slow, secondary fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture to work on the residual sugars that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile. North Country Br\u00fcnette is very tart and dry, with a fine, rounded acidic profile, and a malty, spiced fruity character. This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.\n* '''Black Forest Cherry''', ''ABV 5.1%'',  The maltiness of Black Forest Cherry provides a platform for the tart red cherries to shine through with a highly acidic and fruity character.

Predominantly fruity notes of pineapple, apricot and pear are accompanied by an intense yet refreshing acidity and sparkling carbonation.\n* '''Starkeller Peach''', ''ABV 7.2%'', Bursting with tropical fruit aromas and tart peach flavor with a highly acidic and fruity character.  Full-bodied, dry and highly carbonated, with a complex, rounded fruitiness.\n* '''Apparent Horizon''', ''ABV 5.1%'', Moderate, balanced acidity with notes of lemon and cider. The rye lends a spicy dryness and aroma of sourdough and pumpernickel.\n* '''Apricot Vista''', ''ABV 4.9%'', Bursts with the bold flavor of tart, juicy apricots.

A blend of two different traditional, mixed-culture Berliner Weisse aged for nearly a year in 80 year old cypress wood lagering tanks.

Dusty crimson red in color, a tart cherry aroma emanates from the glass atop an underlying spice. A moderate acidity showcases the cherry tang and almond flavors that mingle together, balancing over a toasty malt backbone, and finishing with a lingering sour, yet sweet, cherry zest.\n* '''Astral Fusion''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Astral Fusion is a mixed-culture Berliner Weisse that was aged for a year in our 80-year-old cypress wood lagering tanks before being transferred onto mangos for an additional three months, and then blended with a portion of raspberry Berliner Weisse before being bottled. The resulting beer is quite tart, bursting with a fruity blend of tropical stone fruit with a hint of raspberries on top of a lemony base acidity.\n* '''Static Transmission''', ''ABV 7%'', Static Transmission pours a hazy gold in color and is bursting with the aromas of fresh wildflowers, lemons and pineapple. Oats lend a rich, creamy mouthfeel over a bright, sweet and sour character. This is the first of the Noble Star line of beers to be released in smaller, 375 ml bottles.\n\n===Grain Belt N'icebreakers===\nUnder its Grain Belt brand, the brewery is releasing hard seltzers in 2020 branded as \"N'icebreakers.\" Samples were served at the 2020 Bockfest celebration, and available flavors include Prickly Pear + Guava.\n\n==Shift Happens Miniseries==\nA \"transitional miniseries in four parts,\" this limited 2020 collection of beers celebrates the 160th anniversary of the brewery.\n* '''Shift Happens No. 1''', ''ABV 9%'', a double dry hopped lager with Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook, and Amarillo hops. Released in January 2020.\n* '''Shift Happens No. 2''', ''ABV 8.6%'', a double dry hopped lager with Citra, Glacier and El Dorado hops. Released in April 2020.\n\n==Stag Series / Variety Pack Brews==\nA collection of innovative and experimental, limited-edition brews released periodically throughout the year. This has evolved to include not beers sold in standalone six packs under the Stag Series label, but also those only available in seasonal variety packs.\n\n===Standalone Stag Series===\n* '''Stag Series #1- Barrel Aged Schmaltz Alt''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Aged in Red Wine Barrels\n*'''Stag Series #2''' '''- Wild Rice Farmhouse Ale'''. The second release in the Stag Series is August Schell's interpretation of a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale. This Farmhouse Ale exhibits an earthy/nutty character due to the generous use of Minnesota Wild Rice, the State Grain of Minnesota. The Wild Rice is combined with 2-Row, Munich, Vienna, and a touch of Rye malt to create a complementary backbone to the unique fermentation characteristics of the yeast.  Dry and thirst quenching, this Farmhouse Ale is hopped with Goldings\n*'''Stag Series #3- Rauchbier'''. A blend of malts smoked over beechwood and cherrywood to create a twist on the traditional style. The remainder of the malt bill includes Dark Munich Malt, Caramunich, and a touch of black malt for color. It is hopped with Tettnang and Sterling.\n*'''Stag Series #4- Burton Ale'''. Schell's Burton Ale is a nod to a forgotten style of beer.  Using traditional floor malted Fawcett Maris Otter as a base, the malt bill also includes torrified wheat and two different British Crystal malts.  As is traditional for British brewers, we added sugar in the kettle, in our case turbinado and some Dark Candi Syrup.  Old Burton Extra is hopped with Nugget and Goldings, fermented with a British ale yeast, dry-hopped, and aged for 3 months prior to release.\n*'''Stag Series #5- Czech Dark Lager'''. Modeled after the famous dark lagers of Bohemia. Dark bread and caramel flavors that are accentuated by a decoction mash, and balanced by the spicy Saaz hops.\n*'''Stag Series #6- Fresh Hop Citra Pils.''' Pilsner brewed with fresh Citra Hop cones\n*'''Stag Series #7- Barleywine''' Two separate mashes of 6,000 pounds of malt and 150 pounds of hops were used to brew this intensely malty and assertively hopped American Barleywine Style Ale.\n*'''Stag Series #8- August's Bock'''. Collaboration with Gold Ochsen Brauerei in New Ulm's sister city, Ulm Germany. Both cities are also host to fifth generation family-owned breweries and both breweries were founded by men named August. Working in collaboration, we decided to brew a Blonde Doppel Bock. Both breweries uses specialty malts from Weyerman with each brewery using their own base Pilsner malt \u2013 Rahr for Schell's and Schwabenmalz for Gold Ochsen. Both breweries use Emerald, Tattnanger and Saphir hops during the boil and then each brewery uses a different newer German hop variety in the whirlpool and as a dry hop. Schell's uses Polaris hops and Gold Ochsen uses Mandarina Bavaria. Both beer are then fermented with the respective brewries\u2019 house lager yeast and matured for a couple of months before packaging\n*'''Stag Series #9- Cave Aged Barrel Aged Lager'''. A dark lager aged in American whiskey barrels stored in the brewery's original, underground lagering caves. Located below the historic brewery, the naturally cooled caverns were originally constructed in the 1860s to facilitate brewing in an era that predated electrical refrigeration. Dark brown to black in color, the beer has roasted malt notes of dark chocolate, toffee, light oak, char and a hint of vanilla.\n* '''Stag Series #10 Tropical Stout''', ''ABV 8.5%'', Caribbean Style Stout \n* '''Stag Series #11 Bananas Foster Weizenbock''', ''ABV 8.14%'',  A robust wheat ale with light cinnamon flavors layered over hints of banana, clove, and caramel.\n*'''Stag Series #12 1879 Kulmbacher Export''', Based on a recipe dated back in 1879 from upper Franconia, this dark, hoppy lager was a favorite that was often imitated by many breweries. As trends changed, the popularity of this style brew faded quickly and is unfamiliar to today's beer drinkers. Bock-like in strength, it asserts its dark color and pronounced hop bitterness.\n*'''Stag Series #13. It's All Relative''', ''ABV 7.0%'', Franconian Dopple Bock brewed in collaboration with [[Wagner Brauerei]] in Germany, this malty lager has a deep amber color and lightly hopped with a hint of smoke.\n* '''Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged''', ''ABV 10.89%'', Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged lager, a [[Baltic Porter]], is released each fall after spending time aging in the historic caves deep below the brewery.

{"title_page": "Polyurethane", "text_new": "'''Polyurethane''' ('''PUR''' and '''PU''') is a [[polymer]] composed of [[organic chemistry|organic]] units joined by [[carbamate]] (urethane) links. While most polyurethanes are [[thermosetting polymer]]s that do not melt when heated, [[thermoplastic polyurethanes]] are also available.\n\nPolyurethane polymers are traditionally and most commonly formed by reacting a di- or [[isocyanate|triisocyanate]] with a [[polyol]]. Since polyurethanes contain two types of monomers, which polymerise one after the other, they are classed as [[Copolymer#Alternating copolymers|alternating copolymers]]. Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make polyurethanes contain, on average, two or more [[functional group]]s per molecule.\n\nPolyurethanes are used in the manufacture of high-resilience foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam [[seal (mechanical)|seals]] and [[gasket]]s, durable elastomeric wheels and tires (such as [[Steel roller coaster|roller coaster]], [[escalator]], [[shopping cart]], [[elevator]], and [[Skateboard#Wheels|skateboard]] wheels), automotive suspension [[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]], [[Potting (electronics)|electrical potting]] compounds, high-performance [[adhesive]]s, surface coatings and sealants,  [[synthetic fibers]] (e.g., [[Spandex]]), [[carpet]] underlay, hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments), condoms,<ref>About Health: [http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/g/Polyurethane_Condoms.htm Polyurethane Condoms].</ref> and hoses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Reticulated foam.JPG|thumb|Polyurethane foam, close-up]]\n[[Otto Bayer]] and his coworkers at [[IG Farben]] in Leverkusen, Germany, first made polyurethanes in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ange.19470590901 |title=Das Di-Isocyanat-Polyadditionsverfahren (Polyurethane) |journal=Angewandte Chemie |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=257\u201372 |year=1947 |last1=Bayer |first1=Otto }}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|country=DE|number=728981|pubdate=1937|inventor=[[IG Farben]]}}</ref> The new polymers had some advantages over existing plastics that were made by polymerizing olefins or by [[polycondensation]], and were not covered by patents obtained by [[Wallace Carothers]] on [[polyester]]s.<ref name=Seymour>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed069p909 |title=Polyurethanes: A class of modern versatile materials |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=69 |issue=11 |page=909 |year=1992 |last1=Seymour |first1=Raymond B. |last2=Kauffman |first2=George B. |bibcode=1992JChEd..69..909S }}</ref> Early work focused on the production of fibres and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during [[World War II]].<ref name=Seymour/> [[Polyisocyanate]]s became commercially available in 1952, and production of flexible polyurethane foam began in 1954 using [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) and polyester polyols.  These materials were also used to produce rigid foams, gum rubber, and [[elastomer]]s. Linear fibers were produced from [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) and [[1,4-Butanediol]] (BDO).\n\nIn 1956 [[DuPont]] introduced polyether polyols, specifically [[poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol]], and [[BASF]] and [[Dow Chemical]] started selling polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. [[Union Carbide]] and [[Mobay]], a U.S. [[Monsanto]]/[[Bayer]] joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals.<ref name=Seymour/> In 1960 more than 45,000 metric tons of flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of [[chlorofluoroalkane]] blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] (MDI) allowed  polyurethane rigid foams to be used as high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified [[polyisocyanurate]] rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and [[flammability]] resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling [[thermoplastic]] skins with semi-rigid foam.\n\nIn 1969, Bayer exhibited an all-plastic car in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany. Parts of this car, such as the [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] and body panels, were manufactured using a new process called [[reaction injection molding]] (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, [[mica]], and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in [[flexural modulus]] (stiffness), reduction in coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] and better thermal stability. This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the [[Pontiac Fiero]], in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as [[Injection molding|resin injection molding]], or structural RIM.\n\nStarting in the early 1980s, water-blown microcellular flexible foams were used to mold gaskets for automotive panels and air-filter seals, replacing [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] polymers.  Polyurethane foams have gained popularity in the automotive realm, and are now used in high-temperature oil-filter applications.\n \nPolyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is sometimes made using small amounts of [[blowing agent]]s to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on [[ozone depletion]], the [[Montreal Protocol]] restricted the use of many [[chlorine]]-containing blowing agents, such as [[trichlorofluoromethane]] (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[pentane]], [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] (HFC-134a) and [[1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane]] (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries. <ref>{{cite conference\n  | first =Bert\n  | last =Feske\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =The Use of Saytex RB-9130/9170 Low Viscosity Brominated Flame Retardant Polyols in HFC-245fa and High Water Formulations\n  | booktitle = Polyurethanes Expo 2004\n  | pages = 309\n  | publisher =Alliance for the Polyurethane Industry Technical Conference\n  | date =October 2004\n  | location =Las Vegas, NV\n  | url = http://www.gbv.de/dms/tib-ub-hannover/48098803X.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | accessdate =2007-08-01}}</ref>  [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane]] (HCFC-141b) was introduced in early 2000s as an alternate blowing agent in developing nations.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nPolyurethane products often are simply called \"urethanes\", but should not be confused with [[ethyl carbamate]], which is also called urethane.

Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] polymer. High amounts of [[cross-link|crosslinking]] give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane can be regarded as one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are [[thermosetting polymers]]. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.\n\nIsocyanates are very reactive materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use.  The aromatic isocyanates, [[diphenylmethane diisocyanate]] (MDI) or [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) are more reactive than [[aliphatic]] isocyanates, such as [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) or [[isophorone diisocyanate]] (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that is they have exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which is a mixture of molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.\n\nPolyols are polymers in their own right and have on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule. Polyether polyols are mostly made by co-polymerizing [[ethylene oxide]] and [[propylene oxide]] with a suitable polyol precursor.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Polyurethanes from Vegetable Oils|first=Zoran S. |last=Petrovi\u0107 |journal=Polymer Reviews |volume=48 |issue=1 |date=2008}}</ref> Polyester polyols are made similarly to [[polyether]] polymers. Polyols used to make polyurethanes are mixtures of similar molecules with distinct molecular weights, which is why the \"average functionality\" is often mentioned. Despite being complex mixtures, industrial grade polyols are sufficiently well controlled to produce polyurethanes with consistent properties. Polyol chain length and functionality contribute much to the polyurethane properties. Polyols used to make rigid polyurethanes have molecular weights in the hundreds, while those used to make flexible polyurethanes have molecular weights in the thousands.\n[[File:PUaminepolymerization.png|480px|thumb|'''PU reaction mechanism''' catalyzed by a tertiary amine]]\n{{image frame\n|caption=Generalized urethane reaction\n|content=<chem>R1-N=C=O + R2-O-H -> R1-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop | }{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-O-R2</chem>\n}}\n\nThe [[polymerization]] reaction makes a polymer containing the urethane linkage, \u2212RNHCOOR\u2032\u2212 and is catalyzed by tertiary [[amine]]s, such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (also called [[DABCO]]), and [[metal]]lic compounds, such as [[dibutyltin dilaurate]] or [[bismuth octanoate]]. Alternatively, it can be promoted by ultraviolet light.<ref name=\"Soto 2014\" /> This is often referred to as the gellation reaction or simply gelling.\n\nIf water is present in the reaction mixture (it is often added intentionally to make foams), the isocyanate reacts with water to form a [[urea]] linkage and [[carbon dioxide]] gas and the resulting polymer contains both urethane and urea linkages. This reaction is referred to as the blowing reaction and is catalyzed by tertiary amines like [[bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether]].\n\nA third reaction, particularly important in making insulating rigid foams is the isocyanate [[trimer (chemistry)|trimerization]] reaction, which is catalyzed by [[potassium octoate]], for example.\n\nOne of the most desirable attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam. Making a foam requires the formation of a gas at the same time as the urethane polymerization (gellation) is occurring. The gas can be [[carbon dioxide]], either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it can also be produced by boiling volatile liquids. In the latter case [[exothermic reaction|heat generated]] by the polymerization causes the liquids to vaporize. The liquids can be HFC-245fa ([[1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane]]) and HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]]), and hydrocarbons such as [[n-pentane|''n''-pentane]].\n{{image frame\n|caption=Carbon dioxide gas formed by reacting '''water''' and '''[[isocyanate]]'''\n|content=\n<math chem>\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\ce{{R-N=C=O} + H2O ->[\\ce{step}\\ 1] R1-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-O-H ->[\\ce{step}\\ 2][\\ce{decomposes}] R-NH2\\ +\\ CO2(g)} \\\\\n\\ce{{R-N=C=O} + R-NH2 ->[\\ce{step}\\ 3] -R-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-R}{-}\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n}}\nThe balance between gellation and blowing is sensitive to operating parameters including the concentrations of water and catalyst. The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable [[carbamic acid]], which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low [[molecular weight]], so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate \"hard segment\" phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can have a significant impact on the properties of the polyurethane foam.<ref>{{Cite thesis\n  | last=Kaushiva|first= Byran D.\n  | title =Structure-Property Relationships of Flexible Polyurethane Foams\n  | type=Ph.D.\n  | publisher =Virginia Polytechnic Institute\n  | date =August 15, 1999\n  | url = http://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-083199-185156/\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nHigh-density [[microcellular]] foams can be formed without the addition of blowing agents by mechanically frothing or nucleating the polyol component prior to use.\n\nSurfactants are used in polyurethane foams to [[emulsion|emulsify]] the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and surface defects. Rigid foam surfactants are designed to produce very fine cells and a very high closed cell content. Flexible foam surfactants are designed to stabilize the reaction mass while at the same time maximizing open cell content to prevent the foam from shrinking.\n\nAn even more rigid foam can be made with the use of specialty trimerization catalysts which create cyclic structures within the foam matrix, giving a harder, more thermally stable structure, designated as [[polyisocyanurate]] foams. Such properties are desired in rigid foam products used in the construction sector.\n\nCareful control of viscoelastic properties \u2013 by modifying the catalysts and polyols used \u2013 can lead to [[memory foam]], which is much softer at skin temperature than at room temperature.\n\nFoams can be either \"closed-cell\", where most of the original bubbles or cells remain intact, or \"open-cell\", where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or [[mattresses]]. Closed-cell rigid foams are used as [[thermal insulation]], for example in [[refrigerators]].\n\nMicrocellular foams are tough elastomeric materials used in coverings of car [[steering wheel]]s or [[shoe sole]]s.\n\n==Raw materials==\nThe main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-[[isocyanates]] and [[polyols]]. Other materials are added to aid processing the polymer or to modify the properties of the polymer.\n\n===Isocyanates===\nIsocyanates used to make polyurethane have two or more isocyanate groups on each molecule. The most commonly used isocyanates are the [[aromaticity|aromatic]] diisocyanates,  [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]], MDI.\n\nTDI and MDI are generally less expensive and more reactive than other isocyanates. Industrial grade TDI and MDI are mixtures of isomers and MDI often contains polymeric materials. They are used to make flexible foam (for example slabstock foam for mattresses or molded foams for car seats),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dowglobal.beta.ides.com/DocSelect.aspx?DOC=DOWTDS&E=101414|title= Technical data sheet from Dow Chemical|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>  rigid foam (for example insulating foam in refrigerators) elastomers (shoe soles, for example),  and so on. The isocyanates may be modified by partially reacting them with polyols or introducing some other materials to reduce volatility (and hence toxicity) of the isocyanates, decrease their freezing points to make handling easier or to improve the properties of the final polymers.\n\n[[File:MDI isomers.PNG|500px|center|MDI isomers and polymer]]\n\nAliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light.<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Randall |last2=Lee|first2= Steve | title=The Polyurethanes Book | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-470-85041-1}}</ref> The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are [[hexamethylene diisocyanate|1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane ([[isophorone diisocyanate]], IPDI), and 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H<sub>12</sub>MDI or hydrogenated MDI).\n\n===Polyols===\n[[Polyols#Polyols in polymer chemistry|Polyols]] can be polyether polyols, which are made by [[ethoxylation|the reaction of epoxides]] with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional [[carboxylic acid]]s and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.\n\nPolyols for flexible applications use low functionality initiators such as [[dipropylene glycol]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[glycerine]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3), or a sorbitol/water solution (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.75).<ref>{{cite patent|title=Polyether polyols suitable for flexible polyurethane foam prepared by co-initiation of aqueous solutions of solid polyhydroxyl initiators|date=Jul 29, 1997|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=E-McAAAAEBAJ|inventor-last=Hager|inventor2-last=Knight|inventor3-last=Helma|inventor-first=Stanley L.|inventor2-first=James E.|inventor3-first=Gregory F.|issue=US5652279 A|accessdate=2017-12-12}}</ref> Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as [[sucrose]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8), [[sorbitol]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6), [[toluenediamine]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4), and [[Mannich base]]s (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4). [[Propylene oxide]] and/or [[ethylene oxide]] is added to the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed [[Copolymer|styrene\u2013acrylonitrile]], [[acrylonitrile]], or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as [[ethylenediamine]] and [[triethanolamine]] are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.  A special class of polyether polyols, [[poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol]]s, which are made by polymerizing [[tetrahydrofuran]], are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.\n\nConventional polyester polyols are based on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification ([[glycolysis]]) of recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|poly(ethyleneterephthalate)]] (PET) or [[dimethylterephthalate]] (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to [[polyisocyanurate]] (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.\n\nSpecialty polyols include [[polycarbonate]] polyols, [[polycaprolactone]] polyols, [[polybutadiene]] polyols, and [[polysulfide]] polyols. The materials are used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. [[Natural oil polyols]] derived from [[castor oil]] and other [[vegetable oils]] are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.\n\nCo-polymerizing [[chlorotrifluoroethylene]] or [[tetrafluoroethylene]] with vinyl ethers containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate have been used to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine\u2013carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.\n\n[[Phosphorus]]-containing polyols are available that become [[Chemical bond|chemically bonded]] to the polyurethane matrix for the use as [[flame retardants]]. This covalent linkage prevents migration and leaching of the organophosphorus compound.\n\n===Bio-derived materials===\nInterest in [[sustainable]] [[green chemistry|\"green\"]] products raised interest in polyols derived from [[vegetable oil]]s.<ref name=\"ussc\">{{cite conference\n  | last =Niemeyer\n  | first =Timothy |last2=Patel|first2= Munjal |last3=Geiger|first3= Eric\n  | title =A Further Examination of Soy-Based Polyols in Polyurethane Systems\n  | booktitle =\n  | publisher = Alliance for the Polyurethane Industry Technical Conference\n  | date = September 2006\n  | location = Salt Lake City, UT\n  | accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | title =New Twist on Green: 2008 Ford Mustang Seats Will Be Soy-Based Foam\n  | publisher =Edmunds inside line| date =July 12, 2007  | url =http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121682  | accessdate =2010-06-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531084933/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121682 |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}</ref>  Various oils used in the preparation polyols for polyurethanes include soybean, cotton seed, neem seed, and castor.

The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.<ref name=\"Oertel 1985\"/><ref>{{cite book | first=J. | last=Blackwell |first2=M.

[[Tertiary amine]] catalysts function by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the diol component. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides function as mild Lewis acids in accelerating the formation of polyurethane.  As bases, traditional amine catalysts include triethylenediamine (TEDA, also called [[DABCO]], 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), [[dimethylcyclohexylamine]] (DMCHA), [[dimethylethanolamine]] (DMEA), and bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, a blowing catalyst also called A-99.  A typical Lewis acidic catalyst is [[dibutyltin dilaurate]].  The process is highly sensitive to the nature of the catalyst and is also known to be [[autocatalytic]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_665.pub2 |chapter=Polyurethanes |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2005 |last1=Adam |first1=Norbert |last2=Avar |first2=Geza |last3=Blankenheim |first3=Herbert |last4=Friederichs |first4=Wolfgang |last5=Giersig |first5=Manfred |last6=Weigand |first6=Eckehard |last7=Halfmann |first7=Michael |last8=Wittbecker |first8=Friedrich-Wilhelm |last9=Larimer |first9=Donald-Richard |last10=Maier |first10=Udo |last11=Meyer-Ahrens |first11=Sven |last12=Noble |first12=Karl-Ludwig |last13=Wussow |first13=Hans-Georg |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2 }}</ref>\n\nFactors affecting catalyst selection include balancing three reactions: urethane (polyol+isocyanate, or gel) formation, the urea (water+isocyanate, or \"blow\") formation, or the isocyanate trimerization reaction (e.g., using potassium acetate, to form [[isocyanurate]] rings).

The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents and so on. The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'.

Regulatory information can be found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 21 (Food and Drugs) and Title 40 (Protection of the Environment). In Europe, health and safety information is available from ISOPA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isopa.org |title=Home : ISOPA |website=www.isopa.org}}</ref> the European Diisocyanate and Polyol Producers Association.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe methods of manufacturing polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, high-volume bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, wait until it cures, then demold the finished part.\n\n===Dispensing equipment===\nAlthough the capital outlay can be high, it is desirable to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater\u2013chiller unit is added to control material temperature in order to improve mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as [[viscosity]] and filler content, and [[process control]]. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs ([[Intermediate bulk container|intermediate bulk containers]], such as [[Caged IBC totes|totes]]), or [[Storage tank|bulk storage tanks]]. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened [[lance pump]]s to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer-milled [[glass fiber]] and [[wollastonite]].\n\n<gallery>\nImage:HighPressureDispenseUnit800x600.png|A high-pressure polyurethane dispense unit, showing control panel, high-pressure pump, integral day tanks, and hydraulic drive unit\nImage:HighPressureLHeadFront600x800.png|A high-pressure mix head, showing simple controls (front view)\nImage:HighPressureLHeadRear600x800.png|A high-pressure mix head, showing material supply and hydraulic actuator lines (rear view)\n</gallery>\n\nThe pumps can drive low-pressure (10 to 30&nbsp;bar, 1 to 3&nbsp;MPa) or high-pressure (125 to 250&nbsp;bar, 12.5 to 25.0&nbsp;MPa) dispense systems. Mix heads can be simple static mix tubes, rotary-element mixers, low-pressure dynamic mixers, or high-pressure hydraulically actuated direct [[Impinging mixer|impingement mixers]]. Control units may have basic on/off and dispense/stop switches, and analogue pressure and temperature gauges, or may be computer-controlled with flow meters to electronically calibrate mix ratio, digital temperature and level sensors, and a full suite of statistical process control software. Add-ons to dispense equipment include nucleation or gas injection units, and third or fourth stream capability for adding pigments or metering in supplemental additive packages.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:LowPressureMixHead600x800.png|A low-pressure mix head with calibration chamber installed, showing material supply and air actuator lines\nImage:LowPressureMixChamberComponents800x600.png|Low-pressure mix head components, including mix chambers, conical mixers, and mounting plates\nImage:LowPressure5GallonDayTanks800x600.png|5-gallon (20-liter) material day tanks for supplying a low-pressure dispense unit\n</gallery>\n\n===Tooling===\nDistinct from pour-in-place, bun and boardstock, and coating applications, the production of piece parts requires tooling to contain and form the reacting liquid.\nThe choice of mold-making material is dependent on the expected number of uses to end-of-life (EOL), molding pressure, flexibility, and heat transfer characteristics.\n\nRTV silicone is used for tooling that has an EOL in the thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding rigid foam parts, where the ability to stretch and peel the mold around undercuts is needed.\nThe heat transfer characteristic of RTV silicone tooling is poor. High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.\n\nEpoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is used for tooling that has an EOL in the tens of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.\n\nAluminum is used for tooling that has an EOL in the hundreds of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding microcellular foam gasketing and cast elastomer parts, and is milled or extruded into shape.\n\nMirror-finish [[stainless steel]] is used for tooling that imparts a glossy appearance to the finished part. The heat transfer characteristic of metal tooling is excellent.\n\nFinally, molded or milled [[polypropylene]] is used to create low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many expensive metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of polypropylene tooling is poor, which must be taken into consideration during the formulation process.\n\n==Applications==\n{{main|List of polyurethane applications|Varnish#Polyurethane|l2=Polyurethane varnish}}\n\nIn 2007, the global consumption of polyurethane raw materials was above 12 million metric tons, and the average annual growth rate was about 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|first=G.|last=Avar|date=October 2008|title=Polyurethanes (PU)|journal=Kunststoffe International|issue=10/2008|pages=123\u20137}}</ref> Revenues generated with PUR on the global market are expected to rise to approximately US$75 billion by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Ceresana|title= Market Study: Polyurethanes and Isocyanates|date= July 2013|url= http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/pur-isocyanates/}}</ref>\n\n==Effects of visible light==\n[[Image:UVDistressedFlexMoldedFoam800x600.png|thumb|left|150px|Polyurethane foam made with an aromatic isocyanate, which has been exposed to UV light. Readily apparent is the discoloration that occurs over time.]]\nPolyurethanes, especially those made using [[aromatic]] isocyanates, contain [[chromophores]] that interact with light.  This is of particular interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where [[light]] stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that [[aliphatic]] isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown.

These materials were also used to produce rigid foams, gum rubber, and [[elastomer]]s. Linear fibers were produced from [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) and [[1,4-Butanediol]] (BDO).\n\nIn 1956 [[DuPont]] introduced polyether polyols, specifically [[poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol]], and [[BASF]] and [[Dow Chemical]] started selling polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. [[Union Carbide]] and [[Mobay]], a U.S. [[Monsanto]]/[[Bayer]] joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals.<ref name=Seymour/> In 1960 more than 45,000 metric tons of flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of [[chlorofluoroalkane]] blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] (MDI) allowed  polyurethane rigid foams to be used as high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified [[polyisocyanurate]] rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and [[flammability]] resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling [[thermoplastic]] skins with semi-rigid foam.\n\nIn 1969, Bayer exhibited an all-plastic car in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany. Parts of this car, such as the [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] and body panels, were manufactured using a new process called [[reaction injection molding]] (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, [[mica]], and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in [[flexural modulus]] (stiffness), reduction in coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] and better thermal stability. This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the [[Pontiac Fiero]], in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as [[Injection molding|resin injection molding]], or structural RIM.\n\nStarting in the early 1980s, water-blown microcellular flexible foams were used to mold gaskets for automotive panels and air-filter seals, replacing [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] polymers.  Polyurethane foams have gained popularity in the automotive realm, and are now used in high-temperature oil-filter applications.\n \nPolyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is sometimes made using small amounts of [[blowing agent]]s to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on [[ozone depletion]], the [[Montreal Protocol]] restricted the use of many [[chlorine]]-containing blowing agents, such as [[trichlorofluoromethane]] (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[pentane]], [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] (HFC-134a) and [[1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane]] (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries. <ref>{{cite conference\n  | first =Bert\n  | last =Feske\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =The Use of Saytex RB-9130/9170 Low Viscosity Brominated Flame Retardant Polyols in HFC-245fa and High Water Formulations\n  | booktitle = Polyurethanes Expo 2004\n  | pages = 309\n  | publisher =Alliance for the Polyurethane Industry Technical Conference\n  | date =October 2004\n  | location =Las Vegas, NV\n  | url = http://www.gbv.de/dms/tib-ub-hannover/48098803X.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | accessdate =2007-08-01}}</ref>  [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane]] (HCFC-141b) was introduced in early 2000s as an alternate blowing agent in developing nations.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nPolyurethane products often are simply called \"urethanes\", but should not be confused with [[ethyl carbamate]], which is also called urethane.

Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] polymer. High amounts of [[cross-link|crosslinking]] give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane can be regarded as one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are [[thermosetting polymers]]. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.\n\nIsocyanates are very reactive materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use.  The aromatic isocyanates, [[diphenylmethane diisocyanate]] (MDI) or [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) are more reactive than [[aliphatic]] isocyanates, such as [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) or [[isophorone diisocyanate]] (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that is they have exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which is a mixture of molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.\n\nPolyols are polymers in their own right and have on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule. Polyether polyols are mostly made by co-polymerizing [[ethylene oxide]] and [[propylene oxide]] with a suitable polyol precursor.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Polyurethanes from Vegetable Oils|first=Zoran S. |last=Petrovi\u0107 |journal=Polymer Reviews |volume=48 |issue=1 |date=2008}}</ref> Polyester polyols are made similarly to [[polyether]] polymers. Polyols used to make polyurethanes are mixtures of similar molecules with distinct molecular weights, which is why the \"average functionality\" is often mentioned. Despite being complex mixtures, industrial grade polyols are sufficiently well controlled to produce polyurethanes with consistent properties. Polyol chain length and functionality contribute much to the polyurethane properties. Polyols used to make rigid polyurethanes have molecular weights in the hundreds, while those used to make flexible polyurethanes have molecular weights in the thousands.\n[[File:PUaminepolymerization.png|480px|thumb|'''PU reaction mechanism''' catalyzed by a tertiary amine]]\n{{image frame\n|caption=Generalized urethane reaction\n|content=<chem>R1-N=C=O + R2-O-H -> R1-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop | }{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-O-R2</chem>\n}}\n\nThe [[polymerization]] reaction makes a polymer containing the urethane linkage, \u2212RNHCOOR\u2032\u2212 and is catalyzed by tertiary [[amine]]s, such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (also called [[DABCO]]), and [[metal]]lic compounds, such as [[dibutyltin dilaurate]] or [[bismuth octanoate]]. Alternatively, it can be promoted by ultraviolet light.<ref name=\"Soto 2014\" /> This is often referred to as the gellation reaction or simply gelling.\n\nIf water is present in the reaction mixture (it is often added intentionally to make foams), the isocyanate reacts with water to form a [[urea]] linkage and [[carbon dioxide]] gas and the resulting polymer contains both urethane and urea linkages. This reaction is referred to as the blowing reaction and is catalyzed by tertiary amines like [[bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether]].\n\nA third reaction, particularly important in making insulating rigid foams is the isocyanate [[trimer (chemistry)|trimerization]] reaction, which is catalyzed by [[potassium octoate]], for example.\n\nOne of the most desirable attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam. Making a foam requires the formation of a gas at the same time as the urethane polymerization (gellation) is occurring. The gas can be [[carbon dioxide]], either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it can also be produced by boiling volatile liquids. In the latter case [[exothermic reaction|heat generated]] by the polymerization causes the liquids to vaporize. The liquids can be HFC-245fa ([[1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane]]) and HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]]), and hydrocarbons such as [[n-pentane|''n''-pentane]].\n{{image frame\n|caption=Carbon dioxide gas formed by reacting '''water''' and '''[[isocyanate]]'''\n|content=\n<math chem>\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\ce{{R-N=C=O} + H2O ->[\\ce{step}\\ 1] R1-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-O-H ->[\\ce{step}\\ 2][\\ce{decomposes}] R-NH2\\ +\\ CO2(g)} \\\\\n\\ce{{R-N=C=O} + R-NH2 ->[\\ce{step}\\ 3] -R-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-\\overset{\\displaystyle O \\atop \\| }{C}-\\underset{ | \\atop \\displaystyle H}{N}-R}{-}\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n}}\nThe balance between gellation and blowing is sensitive to operating parameters including the concentrations of water and catalyst. The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable [[carbamic acid]], which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low [[molecular weight]], so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate \"hard segment\" phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can have a significant impact on the properties of the polyurethane foam.<ref>{{Cite thesis\n  | last=Kaushiva|first= Byran D.\n  | title =Structure-Property Relationships of Flexible Polyurethane Foams\n  | type=Ph.D.\n  | publisher =Virginia Polytechnic Institute\n  | date =August 15, 1999\n  | url = http://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-083199-185156/\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nHigh-density [[microcellular]] foams can be formed without the addition of blowing agents by mechanically frothing or nucleating the polyol component prior to use.\n\nSurfactants are used in polyurethane foams to [[emulsion|emulsify]] the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and surface defects. Rigid foam surfactants are designed to produce very fine cells and a very high closed cell content. Flexible foam surfactants are designed to stabilize the reaction mass while at the same time maximizing open cell content to prevent the foam from shrinking.\n\nAn even more rigid foam can be made with the use of specialty trimerization catalysts which create cyclic structures within the foam matrix, giving a harder, more thermally stable structure, designated as [[polyisocyanurate]] foams. Such properties are desired in rigid foam products used in the construction sector.\n\nCareful control of viscoelastic properties \u2013 by modifying the catalysts and polyols used \u2013 can lead to [[memory foam]], which is much softer at skin temperature than at room temperature.\n\nFoams can be either \"closed-cell\", where most of the original bubbles or cells remain intact, or \"open-cell\", where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or [[mattresses]]. Closed-cell rigid foams are used as [[thermal insulation]], for example in [[refrigerators]].\n\nMicrocellular foams are tough elastomeric materials used in coverings of car [[steering wheel]]s or [[shoe sole]]s.\n\n==Raw materials==\nThe main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-[[isocyanates]] and [[polyols]].

The isocyanates may be modified by partially reacting them with polyols or introducing some other materials to reduce volatility (and hence toxicity) of the isocyanates, decrease their freezing points to make handling easier or to improve the properties of the final polymers.\n\n[[File:MDI isomers.PNG|500px|center|MDI isomers and polymer]]\n\nAliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light.<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Randall |last2=Lee|first2= Steve | title=The Polyurethanes Book | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-470-85041-1}}</ref> The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are [[hexamethylene diisocyanate|1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane ([[isophorone diisocyanate]], IPDI), and 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H<sub>12</sub>MDI or hydrogenated MDI).\n\n===Polyols===\n[[Polyols#Polyols in polymer chemistry|Polyols]] can be polyether polyols, which are made by [[ethoxylation|the reaction of epoxides]] with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional [[carboxylic acid]]s and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.\n\nPolyols for flexible applications use low functionality initiators such as [[dipropylene glycol]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[glycerine]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3), or a sorbitol/water solution (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.75).<ref>{{cite patent|title=Polyether polyols suitable for flexible polyurethane foam prepared by co-initiation of aqueous solutions of solid polyhydroxyl initiators|date=Jul 29, 1997|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=E-McAAAAEBAJ|inventor-last=Hager|inventor2-last=Knight|inventor3-last=Helma|inventor-first=Stanley L.|inventor2-first=James E.|inventor3-first=Gregory F.|issue=US5652279 A|accessdate=2017-12-12}}</ref> Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as [[sucrose]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8), [[sorbitol]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6), [[toluenediamine]] (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4), and [[Mannich base]]s (''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4). [[Propylene oxide]] and/or [[ethylene oxide]] is added to the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed [[Copolymer|styrene\u2013acrylonitrile]], [[acrylonitrile]], or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as [[ethylenediamine]] and [[triethanolamine]] are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.  A special class of polyether polyols, [[poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol]]s, which are made by polymerizing [[tetrahydrofuran]], are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.\n\nConventional polyester polyols are based on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification ([[glycolysis]]) of recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|poly(ethyleneterephthalate)]] (PET) or [[dimethylterephthalate]] (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to [[polyisocyanurate]] (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.\n\nSpecialty polyols include [[polycarbonate]] polyols, [[polycaprolactone]] polyols, [[polybutadiene]] polyols, and [[polysulfide]] polyols. The materials are used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. [[Natural oil polyols]] derived from [[castor oil]] and other [[vegetable oils]] are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.\n\nCo-polymerizing [[chlorotrifluoroethylene]] or [[tetrafluoroethylene]] with vinyl ethers containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate have been used to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine\u2013carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.\n\n[[Phosphorus]]-containing polyols are available that become [[Chemical bond|chemically bonded]] to the polyurethane matrix for the use as [[flame retardants]]. This covalent linkage prevents migration and leaching of the organophosphorus compound.\n\n===Bio-derived materials===\nInterest in [[sustainable]] [[green chemistry|\"green\"]] products raised interest in polyols derived from [[vegetable oil]]s.<ref name=\"ussc\">{{cite conference\n  | last =Niemeyer\n  | first =Timothy |last2=Patel|first2= Munjal |last3=Geiger|first3= Eric\n  | title =A Further Examination of Soy-Based Polyols in Polyurethane Systems\n  | booktitle =\n  | publisher = Alliance for the Polyurethane Industry Technical Conference\n  | date = September 2006\n  | location = Salt Lake City, UT\n  | accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last =  | first =  | title =New Twist on Green: 2008 Ford Mustang Seats Will Be Soy-Based Foam\n  | publisher =Edmunds inside line| date =July 12, 2007  | url =http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121682  | accessdate =2010-06-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531084933/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121682 |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}</ref>  Various oils used in the preparation polyols for polyurethanes include soybean, cotton seed, neem seed, and castor.

The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.<ref name=\"Oertel 1985\"/><ref>{{cite book | first=J. | last=Blackwell |first2=M.

All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable.

Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, wait until it cures, then demold the finished part.\n\n===Dispensing equipment===\nAlthough the capital outlay can be high, it is desirable to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater\u2013chiller unit is added to control material temperature in order to improve mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as [[viscosity]] and filler content, and [[process control]]. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs ([[Intermediate bulk container|intermediate bulk containers]], such as [[Caged IBC totes|totes]]), or [[Storage tank|bulk storage tanks]]. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened [[lance pump]]s to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer-milled [[glass fiber]] and [[wollastonite]].\n\n<gallery>\nImage:HighPressureDispenseUnit800x600.png|A high-pressure polyurethane dispense unit, showing control panel, high-pressure pump, integral day tanks, and hydraulic drive unit\nImage:HighPressureLHeadFront600x800.png|A high-pressure mix head, showing simple controls (front view)\nImage:HighPressureLHeadRear600x800.png|A high-pressure mix head, showing material supply and hydraulic actuator lines (rear view)\n</gallery>\n\nThe pumps can drive low-pressure (10 to 30&nbsp;bar, 1 to 3&nbsp;MPa) or high-pressure (125 to 250&nbsp;bar, 12.5 to 25.0&nbsp;MPa) dispense systems. Mix heads can be simple static mix tubes, rotary-element mixers, low-pressure dynamic mixers, or high-pressure hydraulically actuated direct [[Impinging mixer|impingement mixers]]. Control units may have basic on/off and dispense/stop switches, and analogue pressure and temperature gauges, or may be computer-controlled with flow meters to electronically calibrate mix ratio, digital temperature and level sensors, and a full suite of statistical process control software. Add-ons to dispense equipment include nucleation or gas injection units, and third or fourth stream capability for adding pigments or metering in supplemental additive packages.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:LowPressureMixHead600x800.png|A low-pressure mix head with calibration chamber installed, showing material supply and air actuator lines\nImage:LowPressureMixChamberComponents800x600.png|Low-pressure mix head components, including mix chambers, conical mixers, and mounting plates\nImage:LowPressure5GallonDayTanks800x600.png|5-gallon (20-liter) material day tanks for supplying a low-pressure dispense unit\n</gallery>\n\n===Tooling===\nDistinct from pour-in-place, bun and boardstock, and coating applications, the production of piece parts requires tooling to contain and form the reacting liquid.\nThe choice of mold-making material is dependent on the expected number of uses to end-of-life (EOL), molding pressure, flexibility, and heat transfer characteristics.\n\nRTV silicone is used for tooling that has an EOL in the thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding rigid foam parts, where the ability to stretch and peel the mold around undercuts is needed.\nThe heat transfer characteristic of RTV silicone tooling is poor. High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.\n\nEpoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is used for tooling that has an EOL in the tens of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.\n\nAluminum is used for tooling that has an EOL in the hundreds of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding microcellular foam gasketing and cast elastomer parts, and is milled or extruded into shape.\n\nMirror-finish [[stainless steel]] is used for tooling that imparts a glossy appearance to the finished part. The heat transfer characteristic of metal tooling is excellent.\n\nFinally, molded or milled [[polypropylene]] is used to create low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many expensive metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of polypropylene tooling is poor, which must be taken into consideration during the formulation process.\n\n==Applications==\n{{main|List of polyurethane applications|Varnish#Polyurethane|l2=Polyurethane varnish}}\n\nIn 2007, the global consumption of polyurethane raw materials was above 12 million metric tons, and the average annual growth rate was about 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|first=G.|last=Avar|date=October 2008|title=Polyurethanes (PU)|journal=Kunststoffe International|issue=10/2008|pages=123\u20137}}</ref> Revenues generated with PUR on the global market are expected to rise to approximately US$75 billion by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Ceresana|title= Market Study: Polyurethanes and Isocyanates|date= July 2013|url= http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/pur-isocyanates/}}</ref>\n\n==Effects of visible light==\n[[Image:UVDistressedFlexMoldedFoam800x600.png|thumb|left|150px|Polyurethane foam made with an aromatic isocyanate, which has been exposed to UV light.

This is of particular interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where [[light]] stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that [[aliphatic]] isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown.

The original standard, published in 1989, did not give the cipher any name, but the most recent revision of the standard, '''GOST R 34.12-2015''', specifies that it may be referred to as Magma.<ref name=\"std2015\"/> The [[GOST (hash function)|GOST hash function]] is based on this cipher. The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called [[Kuznyechik]]. \n\nDeveloped in the 1970s, the standard had been marked \"Top Secret\" and then downgraded to \"Secret\" in 1990. Shortly after the dissolution of the [[USSR]], it was declassified and it was released to the public in 1994. GOST 28147 was a Soviet alternative to the [[United States]] standard algorithm, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]].<ref name=fleischmann2009>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Fleischmann\n |first=Ewan\n |author2=Gorski, Michael |author3=H\u00fchne, Jan-Hendrik |author4= Lucks, Stefan\n |title=Key Recovery Attack on Full GOST Block Cipher with Zero Time and Memory\n |journal=Published as ISO/IEC JTC\n |year=2009\n |volume=1}}\n</ref> Thus, the two are very similar in structure.\n\n==The algorithm==\n\nGOST has a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a [[key length]] of 256 bits. Its [[S-box]]es can be secret, and they contain about 354 (log<sub>2</sub>(16!<sup>8</sup>)) bits of secret information, so the effective key size can be increased to 610 bits; however, a chosen-key attack can recover the contents of the S-Boxes in approximately 2<sup>32</sup> encryptions.<ref>{{\ncite journal\n |last=Saarinen\n |first=Markku-Juhani\n |title=A chosen key attack against the secret S-boxes of GOST\n |year=1998\n |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rd/96002585%2C277448%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/compress/0/papers/cs/13215/http:zSzzSzwww.jyu.fizSz~mjoszSzgost_cka.ps.gz/saarinen98chosen.ps\n |quote=We show that a simple \"black box\" chosen-key attack against GOST can recover secret S-boxes with approximately 2^32 encryptions}}\n</ref>\n\nGOST is a [[Feistel network]] of 32 rounds. Its round function is very simple: add a 32-bit subkey [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2<sup>32</sup>, put the result through a layer of S-boxes, and rotate that result left by 11 bits. The result of that is the output of the round function. In the adjacent diagram, one line represents 32 bits.\n\nThe subkeys are chosen in a pre-specified order. The key schedule is very simple: break the 256-bit key into eight 32-bit subkeys, and each subkey is used four times in the algorithm; the first 24 rounds use the key words in order, the last 8 rounds use them in reverse order.\n\nThe S-boxes accept a four-bit input and produce a four-bit output. The S-box substitution in the round function consists of eight 4 \u00d7 4 S-boxes. The S-boxes are implementation-dependent, thus parties that want to secure their communications using GOST must be using the same S-boxes. For extra security, the S-boxes can be kept secret. In the original standard where GOST was specified, no S-boxes were given, but they were to be supplied somehow. This led to speculation that organizations the government wished to spy on were given weak S-boxes. One GOST chip manufacturer reported that he generated S-boxes himself using a [[pseudorandom number generator]].<ref name=schneier1996>\n{{cite book\n |last=Schneier\n |first=Bruce\n |title=Applied cryptography : protocols, algorithms, and source code in C\n |url=https://archive.org/details/Applied_Cryptography_2nd_ed._B._Schneier\n |year=1996\n |publisher=Wiley\n |location=New York [u.a.]\n |isbn=978-0-471-11709-4\n |edition=2. ed., [Nachdr.]}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank of Russian Federation]] used the following S-boxes: <!--http://www.intuit.ru/department/security/networksec/3/4.html-->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n !#\n !S-Box\n |-\n !1\n |4 A 9 2 D 8 0 E 6 B 1 C 7 F 5 3\n |-\n !2\n |E B 4 C 6 D F A 2 3 8 1 0 7 5 9\n |-\n !3\n |5 8 1 D A 3 4 2 E F C 7 6 0 9 B\n |-\n !4\n |7 D A 1 0 8 9 F E 4 6 C B 2 5 3\n |-\n !5\n |6 C 7 1 5 F D 8 4 A 9 E 0 3 B 2\n |-\n !6\n |4 B A 0 7 2 1 D 3 6 8 5 9 C F E\n |-\n !7\n |D B 4 1 3 F 5 9 0 A E 7 6 8 2 C\n |-\n !8\n |1 F D 0 5 7 A 4 9 2 3 E 6 B 8 C\n |}\n\nHowever, the most recent revision of the standard, '''GOST R 34.12-2015''', adds the missing S-Box specification and defines it as follows.<ref name=\"std2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://tc26.ru/standard/gost/GOST_R_3412-2015.pdf |title=GOST R 34.12-2015 (Russian only)  |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113434/http://tc26.ru/standard/gost/GOST_R_3412-2015.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n !#\n !GOST R 34.12-2015 S-Box\n |-\n !1\n |C 4 6 2 A 5 B 9 E 8 D 7 0 3 F 1\n |-\n !2\n |6 8 2 3 9 A 5 C 1 E 4 7 B D 0 F\n |-\n !3\n |B 3 5 8 2 F A D E 1 7 4 C 9 6 0\n |-\n !4\n |C 8 2 1 D 4 F 6 7 0 A 5 3 E 9 B\n |-\n !5\n |7 F 5 A 8 1 6 D 0 9 3 E B 4 2 C\n |-\n !6\n |5 D F 6 9 2 C A B 7 8 1 4 3 E 0\n |-\n !7\n |8 E 2 5 6 9 1 C F 4 B 0 D A 3 7\n |-\n !8\n |1 7 E D 0 5 8 3 4 F A 6 9 C B 2\n |}\n\n==Cryptanalysis of GOST==\n\nThe latest cryptanalysis of GOST shows that it is secure in a theoretical sense.

The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called [[Kuznyechik]]. \n\nDeveloped in the 1970s, the standard had been marked \"Top Secret\" and then downgraded to \"Secret\" in 1990. Shortly after the dissolution of the [[USSR]], it was declassified and it was released to the public in 1994. GOST 28147 was a Soviet alternative to the [[United States]] standard algorithm, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]].<ref name=fleischmann2009>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Fleischmann\n |first=Ewan\n |author2=Gorski, Michael |author3=H\u00fchne, Jan-Hendrik |author4= Lucks, Stefan\n |title=Key Recovery Attack on Full GOST Block Cipher with Zero Time and Memory\n |journal=Published as ISO/IEC JTC\n |year=2009\n |volume=1}}\n</ref> Thus, the two are very similar in structure.\n\n==The algorithm==\n\nGOST has a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a [[key length]] of 256 bits. Its [[S-box]]es can be secret, and they contain about 354 (log<sub>2</sub>(16!<sup>8</sup>)) bits of secret information, so the effective key size can be increased to 610 bits; however, a chosen-key attack can recover the contents of the S-Boxes in approximately 2<sup>32</sup> encryptions.<ref>{{\ncite journal\n |last=Saarinen\n |first=Markku-Juhani\n |title=A chosen key attack against the secret S-boxes of GOST\n |year=1998\n |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rd/96002585%2C277448%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/compress/0/papers/cs/13215/http:zSzzSzwww.jyu.fizSz~mjoszSzgost_cka.ps.gz/saarinen98chosen.ps\n |quote=We show that a simple \"black box\" chosen-key attack against GOST can recover secret S-boxes with approximately 2^32 encryptions}}\n</ref>\n\nGOST is a [[Feistel network]] of 32 rounds. Its round function is very simple: add a 32-bit subkey [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2<sup>32</sup>, put the result through a layer of S-boxes, and rotate that result left by 11 bits. The result of that is the output of the round function. In the adjacent diagram, one line represents 32 bits.\n\nThe subkeys are chosen in a pre-specified order. The key schedule is very simple: break the 256-bit key into eight 32-bit subkeys, and each subkey is used four times in the algorithm; the first 24 rounds use the key words in order, the last 8 rounds use them in reverse order.\n\nThe S-boxes accept a four-bit input and produce a four-bit output. The S-box substitution in the round function consists of eight 4 \u00d7 4 S-boxes. The S-boxes are implementation-dependent. Parties that want to secure their communications using GOST must be using the same S-boxes. For extra security, the S-boxes can be kept secret. In the original standard where GOST was specified, no S-boxes were given, but they were to be supplied somehow. This led to speculation that organizations the government wished to spy on were given weak S-boxes. One GOST chip manufacturer reported that he generated S-boxes himself using a [[pseudorandom number generator]].<ref name=schneier1996>\n{{cite book\n |last=Schneier\n |first=Bruce\n |title=Applied cryptography : protocols, algorithms, and source code in C\n |url=https://archive.org/details/Applied_Cryptography_2nd_ed._B._Schneier\n |year=1996\n |publisher=Wiley\n |location=New York [u.a.]\n |isbn=978-0-471-11709-4\n |edition=2. ed., [Nachdr.]}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank of Russian Federation]] used the following S-boxes: <!--http://www.intuit.ru/department/security/networksec/3/4.html-->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n !#\n !S-Box\n |-\n !1\n |4 A 9 2 D 8 0 E 6 B 1 C 7 F 5 3\n |-\n !2\n |E B 4 C 6 D F A 2 3 8 1 0 7 5 9\n |-\n !3\n |5 8 1 D A 3 4 2 E F C 7 6 0 9 B\n |-\n !4\n |7 D A 1 0 8 9 F E 4 6 C B 2 5 3\n |-\n !5\n |6 C 7 1 5 F D 8 4 A 9 E 0 3 B 2\n |-\n !6\n |4 B A 0 7 2 1 D 3 6 8 5 9 C F E\n |-\n !7\n |D B 4 1 3 F 5 9 0 A E 7 6 8 2 C\n |-\n !8\n |1 F D 0 5 7 A 4 9 2 3 E 6 B 8 C\n |}\n\nHowever, the most recent revision of the standard, '''GOST R 34.12-2015''', adds the missing S-Box specification and defines it as follows.<ref name=\"std2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://tc26.ru/standard/gost/GOST_R_3412-2015.pdf |title=GOST R 34.12-2015 (Russian only)  |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113434/http://tc26.ru/standard/gost/GOST_R_3412-2015.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n !#\n !GOST R 34.12-2015 S-Box\n |-\n !1\n |C 4 6 2 A 5 B 9 E 8 D 7 0 3 F 1\n |-\n !2\n |6 8 2 3 9 A 5 C 1 E 4 7 B D 0 F\n |-\n !3\n |B 3 5 8 2 F A D E 1 7 4 C 9 6 0\n |-\n !4\n |C 8 2 1 D 4 F 6 7 0 A 5 3 E 9 B\n |-\n !5\n |7 F 5 A 8 1 6 D 0 9 3 E B 4 2 C\n |-\n !6\n |5 D F 6 9 2 C A B 7 8 1 4 3 E 0\n |-\n !7\n |8 E 2 5 6 9 1 C F 4 B 0 D A 3 7\n |-\n !8\n |1 7 E D 0 5 8 3 4 F A 6 9 C B 2\n |}\n\n==Cryptanalysis of GOST==\n\nThe latest cryptanalysis of GOST shows that it is secure in a theoretical sense.
