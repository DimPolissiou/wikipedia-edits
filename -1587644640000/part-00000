The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in March 18 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated.

The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August, in the [[Scimitar Hill (battle)|Battle of Scimitar Hill]] and the [[Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)|Battle of Hill 60]]. Control of the hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts but the attacks failed. On 17 August, Hamilton had requested another {{nowrap|95,000 troops}} but a day earlier, the French had announced plans to Kitchener for an autumn offensive in France. A meeting of the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August determined that the French offensive would be supported by a maximum effort, which left only about {{nowrap|25,000 reinforcements}} for the Dardanelles. On 23 August, after news of the failure at Scimitar Hill, Hamilton went onto the defensive as Bulgarian entry into the war, which would allow the Germans to rearm the Turkish army, was imminent and left little opportunity for the resumption of offensive operations. On 20 September 1915, the [[Newfoundland Regiment]] was deployed at Suvla Bay with the 29th Division.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|pp=155\u201392}} On 25 September, Kitchener detached two British and one French division for service in [[Salonika]] in Greece, which was the beginning of the end of the Allied campaign at Gallipoli.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|pp=363\u201376}}\n\n[[Alan Moorehead]] wrote that during the stalemate, an old Ottoman [[Batman (military)|batman]] was regularly permitted to hang his platoon's washing on the barbed wire undisturbed and that there was a \"constant traffic\" of gifts being thrown across no-man's land, dates and sweets from the Ottoman side and cans of beef and packs of cigarettes from the Allied side.{{sfn|Moorehead|1997|p=158}} Conditions at Gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in the fly population. Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid. The precarious Allied lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems. A [[dysentery]] epidemic spread through the Allied trenches at Anzac and Helles, while the Ottomans also suffered heavily from disease which resulted in many deaths.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=314}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nAfter the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in Britain, with criticism of Hamilton's performance being smuggled out by [[Keith Murdoch]], [[Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett]] and other reporters.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=26}} Stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to the air of gloom and the possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915.

The untenable nature of the Allied position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 November 1915. The downpour at Suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=255\u201356}} Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as [[William Scurry]]'s self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=260}} At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. A mine was detonated at the Nek, which killed {{nowrap|70 Ottoman}} soldiers.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=208}} The Allied force was embarked, with the Australians suffering no casualties on the final night but large quantities of supplies and stores fell into Ottoman hands.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=93}}\n\n[[File:W Beach Helles Gallipoli.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Landing at Cape Helles|W Beach, Helles]], on 7 January 1916 just prior to the final evacuation]]\n\nHelles was retained for a period but a decision to evacuate the garrison was made on 28 December.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=526}} Unlike the evacuation from Anzac Cove, Ottoman forces were looking for signs of withdrawal.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} Having used the interval to bring up reinforcements and supplies, Sanders mounted an attack on the British at Gully Spur on 7 January 1916 with infantry and artillery but the attack was a costly failure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=266}} Mines were laid with time fuzes and that night and on the night of 7/8 January, under the cover of a naval bombardment, the British troops began to fall back {{convert|5|mi|km}} from their lines to the beaches, where makeshift piers were used to board boats.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=126}} The last British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=266}} The Newfoundland Regiment was part of the [[rearguard]] and withdrew on 9 January 1916.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|p=480}} Among the first to land, remnants of The Plymouth Battalion, Royal Marine Light Infantry were the last to leave the Peninsula.{{sfn|Lockhart|1950|p=17}}\n\nDespite predictions of up to {{nowrap|30,000 casualties,}} {{nowrap|35,268 troops,}} {{nowrap|3,689 horses}} and mules, {{nowrap|127 guns,}} {{nowrap|328 vehicles}} and {{convert|1600|LT|MT}} of equipment were removed;{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=126}} {{nowrap|508 mules}} that could not be embarked were killed so as not to fall into Ottoman hands and {{nowrap|1,590 vehicles}} were left behind with smashed wheels.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|p=478}} As at Anzac, large amounts of supplies (including 15 British and six French unserviceable artillery pieces which were destroyed), gun carriages and ammunition were left behind; hundreds of horses were slaughtered to deny them to the Ottomans.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies,{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=268, 269}} while [[Les Carlyon|Carlyon]] views the overall result as a stalemate.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=518}} [[Peter Hart (military historian)|Peter Hart]] disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\",{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} while [[Philip Haythornthwaite|Haythornthwaite]] calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\".{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to&nbsp;... [Ottoman] national resources\",{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} and at that stage of the war the Allies were in a better position to replace their losses than the Ottomans,{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=98}} but ultimately the Allied attempt at securing a passage through the Dardanelles proved unsuccessful. While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

as the '''Dardanelles campaign''', the '''Battle of Gallipoli''' or the '''Battle of \u00c7anakkale''' ({{lang-tr|\u00c7anakkale Sava\u015f\u0131}}), was a campaign of the [[First World War]] that took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia. The British briefly bombarded forts in Gallipoli, invaded [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]] and studied the possibility of forcing the Dardanelles.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=19\u201323}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=40}}\n\n===Allied strategy and the Dardanelles===\n\n[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|thumb|left|Sea access to Russia through the Dardanelles (in yellow)]]\nBefore the Dardanelles operation was conceived, the British had planned to conduct an amphibious invasion near [[Alexandretta]] on the Mediterranean, an idea originally presented by [[Boghos Nubar]] in 1914.{{sfn|Erickson|2013|p=159}} This plan was developed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Field Marshal]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener]] to sever the capital from Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Alexandretta was an area with a Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Empire's railway network\u2014its capture would have cut the empire in two. Vice Admiral Sir [[Richard Peirse (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Peirse]], [[Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]], ordered Captain Frank Larkin of {{HMS|Doris|1896|6}} to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914. The {{ship|Russian cruiser|Askold|1900|6}} and the French [[cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Requin||2}} were also there. Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders. The [[Maneuver warfare|war of manoeuvre]] had ended and been replaced by [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=224}} The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east. The [[White Sea]] in the arctic north and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the Far East were icebound in winter and distant from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]; the [[Baltic Sea]] was blockaded by the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial German Navy) and the entrance to the [[Black Sea]] through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Corbett|2009|pp=158, 166}} While the Ottomans remained neutral, supplies could still be sent to Russia through the Dardanelles but prior to the Ottoman entry into the war, the straits had been closed; in November the Ottomans began to [[Naval mine|mine]] the waterway.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=6}}{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=34}}\n\nThe French Minister of Justice, [[Aristide Briand]], proposed in November to attack the Ottoman Empire but this was rejected and an attempt by the British to bribe the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|p=115}} Later that month, [[Winston Churchill]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength.

The untenable nature of the Allied position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 November 1915. The downpour at Suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=255\u201356}} Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as [[William Scurry]]'s self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=260}} At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies,{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=268, 269}} while [[Les Carlyon|Carlyon]] views the overall result as a stalemate.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=518}} [[Peter Hart (military historian)|Peter Hart]] disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\",{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} while [[Philip Haythornthwaite|Haythornthwaite]] calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\".{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to&nbsp;...

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

Scheduled services were introduced as '''Tradewinds Airlines''' on 21 February 1989, when it leased [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|McDonnell Douglas MD-87]] aeroplanes for services to 5 destinations: [[U-Tapao International Airport|Pattaya]], [[Phuket International Airport|Phuket]], [[Hat Yai International Airport|Hat Yai]], and [[Kuantan]] from Singapore's [[Changi International Airport]], and [[Tioman]] from Singapore's [[Seletar Airport]]. As the carrier matured, regional business destinations such as [[Jakarta]], [[Phnom Penh]], and [[Yangon]] were added to its network, thereby broadening the airline's appeal beyond the holiday-maker to include the business traveller.\n\nA major marketing overhaul was started in 1991, culminating on 1 April 1992, by giving the airline its present name and logo as a new corporate identity. The re-branded airline utilised up to six of the new [[Boeing 737#737-300|Boeing 737-300s]] introduced just a year earlier. The mid-1990s saw two [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-200]] aircraft in use and the expansion of services to [[India]] as well as mainland China. It was the first Asian carrier to offer handheld portable video-on-demand (VOD) [[in-flight entertainment]] in the form of the ''DigEplayer'' 5500, available on flights to selected countries.<ref>{{cite web| title=Inflight Entertainment| publisher=SilkAir| url=http://www.silkair.com/mbe/en_UK/content/experience/inflightentertainment.jsp?JSESSIONID=HybCFnTmrV30KdjPNyY2LChw02GJyvRgDn5bysL8Tt5ZQkLZ4mFQ!875077365!NONE| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614124853/http://www.silkair.com/mbe/en_UK/content/experience/inflightentertainment.jsp?JSESSIONID=HybCFnTmrV30KdjPNyY2LChw02GJyvRgDn5bysL8Tt5ZQkLZ4mFQ!875077365!NONE| url-status=dead| archive-date=2011-06-14}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April 2015, SilkAir launched a new collection of uniforms, the fourth uniform change in over 26 years.

Scheduled services were introduced as '''Tradewinds Airlines''' on 21 February 1989, when it leased [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|McDonnell Douglas MD-87]] aeroplanes for services to 5 destinations: [[U-Tapao International Airport|Pattaya]], [[Phuket International Airport|Phuket]], [[Hat Yai International Airport|Hat Yai]], and [[Kuantan]] from Singapore's [[Changi International Airport]], and [[Tioman]] from Singapore's [[Seletar Airport]]. As the carrier matured, regional business destinations such as [[Jakarta]], [[Phnom Penh]], and [[Yangon]] were added to its network, thereby broadening the airline's appeal beyond the holiday-maker to include the business traveller.\n\nA major marketing overhaul was started in 1991, culminating on 1 April 1992, by giving the airline its present name and logo as a new corporate identity. The re-branded airline utilised up to six of the new [[Boeing 737#737-300|Boeing 737-300s]] introduced just a year earlier. The mid-1990s saw two [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-200]] aircraft in use and the expansion of services to [[India]] as well as mainland China. It was the first Asian carrier to offer handheld portable video-on-demand (VOD) [[in-flight entertainment]] in the form of the ''DigEplayer'' 5500, available on flights to selected countries.<ref>{{cite web| title=Inflight Entertainment| publisher=SilkAir| url=http://www.silkair.com/mbe/en_UK/content/experience/inflightentertainment.jsp?JSESSIONID=HybCFnTmrV30KdjPNyY2LChw02GJyvRgDn5bysL8Tt5ZQkLZ4mFQ!875077365!NONE| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614124853/http://www.silkair.com/mbe/en_UK/content/experience/inflightentertainment.jsp?JSESSIONID=HybCFnTmrV30KdjPNyY2LChw02GJyvRgDn5bysL8Tt5ZQkLZ4mFQ!875077365!NONE| url-status=dead| archive-date=2011-06-14}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April 2015, SilkAir launched a new collection of uniforms, the fourth uniform change in over 26 years.

The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out of court settlement.
