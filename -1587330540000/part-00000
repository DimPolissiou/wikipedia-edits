{"title_page": "Access Grid", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}{{primary source|date=May 2012}}\n'''Access Grid''' is a collection of resources and technologies that enables large format [[Sound reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] based [[collaboration]] between groups of people in different locations. The Access Grid is an ensemble of resources, including [[multimedia]] large-format displays, presentation and interactive environments, and interfaces with [[grid computing]] [[middleware]] and [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]] environments. In simple terms, it is advanced [[videoconferencing]] using big displays and with multiple simultaneous camera feeds at each node (site). The technology was invented at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], Chicago.\n\nThe \"Alliance Chautauqua 99\", a series of two-day conferences on computational science organised by the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]], was the first large-scale Access Grid event. The Access Grid was later demonstrated at Supercomputing'99 in Portland to an international audience. \n\n{{As of|2005}} there are well over 500 nodes around the world that allow for various forms of creative and academic collaborations. Access Grid users tend to use [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] as their text-based back-end. Indeed, the [http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/fl/research/accessgrid/software/releases/3.0.1/ new version of the Access Grid Toolkit] integrates an XMPP client with the Access Grid software.\n\nThe latest stable version of the software is release 3.2.

Growing up in a working class family, he graduated from elementary school in [[Stryi|Stryj]]. His railwayman father arranged Bartel to be an apprentice to fitter who taught in craft school. This allowed Bartel to continue his formal education while working as an apprentice.<ref name=deregowski>[https://psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/106 Kazimierz Bartel (1882-1941) by J. B. Deregowski]</ref>\n\nAfter completing secondary school in 1901, Bartel studied mechanics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic]] in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He graduated summa cum laude in 1907 and soon started working for his alma mater as an assistant in descriptive geometry to Placyd Zdzis\u0142aw Dziwinski.<ref name=mactutor>[http://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bartel.html MacTutor biography]</ref> From 1908 to 1909, he also studied mathematics and philosophy at the Franciscan University in Lviv and at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. The travel grant to Munich allowed him to attend the lectures on art history by Karl Dochlemann and mathematics by Aurel Voss and [[Alfred Pringsheim]].<ref name=deregowski/> He returned to the Polytechnic school and earned his doctor of technical sciences in 1909. His dissertation \"O utworach szereg\u00f3w i p\u0119k\u00f3w inwolucyjnych\" (Compositions series and involution pencils) allowed him to become one of the first title holders of such doctoral within Austria-Hungary. Bartel gave his habilitation thesis \"O p\u0142askich utworach inwolucji stopnia czwartego szeregu zerowego\" (On planar products of involution of the fourth series of the zero degree) in 1912<ref>[https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/402157/DejinyMat_47-2011-1_7.pdf The growth of mathematical culture in the Lvov area in the autonomy period (1870\u20131920)]</ref>, then received the title of associate professor.

In 1919, as commander of [[railway troops]], he fought in the defence of the city against the Ukrainian [[siege]]. During this period, Bartel wrote his first textbook on descriptive geometry<ref name=deregowski/> and befriended and later supported Poland's future leader, [[Marshal of Poland|marshal]] and commander-in-chief, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Since May 1919 he served as the manager of the Armoured Trains Construction Management and Association. His numerous successes in this field led to Prime Minister [[Leopold Skulski]] appointing him the Minister of the Railway system of the Republic of Poland. During this time Bartel met other significant and influential politicians and diplomats, most notably Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]] and Prime Minister [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]]. Following the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1920, Bartel was nominated as a lieutenant colonel and was left in charge of the railway reserve officers and the Lw\u00f3w [[militia]].<ref name=\"klp.pl\"/> He was awarded a [[Virtuti Militari]] cross, a Polish distinction for valor, after the armed conflict.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\nIm 1921, Bartel spent six months travelling to museums and galleries in France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to research on art. Most of his holidays were spent likewise due to his interest stemming from Dochlemann's lectures. He accumulated a good personal archive of notes and photographs for this interest of his.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nIn 1922 Bartel was elected a member of Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' (parliament) and held this position until 1929. Initially, he was a member of the party PSL \"Liberation\", but he was not satisfied with the radicalization of the group. In March 1925 at the Congress of the Polish People's Party he decided to adopt, among others, a reform without compensation. Bartel eventually left the party and the organisation in April 1925, along with [[Marian Zyndram-Ko\u015bcia\u0142kowski]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Wys\u0142ouch]] and later founded the parliamentary \"Labour Club\". This organization quickly came under the direct influence of commander-in-chief [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Just before the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 Kazimierz Bartel received an order from Marshal Pi\u0142sudski to prepare for a take over as prime minister after the expected collapse of President [[Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski]] and his government.<ref name=\"szkolnictwo.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.szkolnictwo.pl/szukaj,Kazimierz_Bartel|title=Kazimierz Bartel - Szkolnictwo.pl|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===First term in office, first government (1926)===\nOn 15 May 1926, after the resignation of the government led by [[Wincenty Witos]] and president Wojciechowski following the May Coup, Bartel was appointed by [[Marshal of the Sejm]] and the acting head of state [[Maciej Rataj]] as the prime minister of the Second Polish Republic, although, Bartel later stated in his inauguration speech that he would only be the head of government until the election of a new president. His decision was possibly influenced by the fact that he suffered from kidney and stomach problems and was constantly in pain. One member of the parliament stated that \"He was a cheerful and ambitious man, but always in pain. Even his opponents in the Sejm admitted that in personal relationships, it is extremely hard not to be in favour of a man like Bartel. As prime minister, he tried to aid every man possible, even the men and women that opposed his policies and the government, but he was not able to help himself, which led to his early decline in politics and diplomacy of the Polish Republic. He was of weak stature and of weak health and would hardly make a good impression on the public, especially the socialists or communists in the east and therefore, this would not make him an influential Prime Minister nor a diplomat supporting democracy.\"\n[[File:Kazimierz Bartel.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, 1928]]\nBartel's new government consisted mostly of people not connected with any political parties (four of those politicians already were occupied ministerial positions). Bartel was described as ideologically centrist&nbsp;\u2013 Prime Minister's newly established office was occupied by both the right-wing leaders and left. Bartel himself took over the Ministry in turn, and Pi\u0142sudski the Minister of War. Such a system churned mainly the [[Polish Socialist Party]], which supported the May Coup. On 16 May 1926, Prime Minister Bartel made a statement in which he highlighted the principles of his policies. Bartel stated that the cabinet took power in accordance with the law, without any [[prejudice]] to the constitutional order. He also called for peace, hard work and dedication to the [[Poland|Polish nation]]. At the same time he promised the immediate removal of incompetent and corrupt politicians from any high posts that could negatively influence the future economic growth of the Second Polish Republic. Bartel's closest personal advisor in politics and diplomacy was Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who was in favour of the new minister.<ref name=\"dziennik.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/historia/ksiazki/artykuly/476383,kazimierz-bartel-polski-premier-ktorego-kusil-adolf-hitler-mariusz-urbanek-lwowska-szkola-matematyczna-recenzja.html|title=Polski premier, kt\u00f3rego kusi\u0142 Hitler|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBartel suggested that [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] should become a candidate for the post of head of state (president), who was also a professor at the [[Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic]]. Bartel's first government was one of the most active in the history of Poland; the politicians and members of parliament gathered every second day and on occasions everyday to discuss political matters. On 4 June 1926 Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki was elected the president of the Second Polish Republic and subsequently Bartel resigned along with the entire cabinet, however, soon after being appointed President Mo\u015bcicki designated him again to become Prime Minister.\n\n===Second and third government (1926)===\nOn 8 June 1926&nbsp;\u2013 three days after the Mo\u015bcicki's designation&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel formed his second cabinet. On the same day J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski sent a letter to the head office, in which he outlined the conditions re-entry to the parliament. Following his second election, Kazimierz Bartel primarily focused on the restoration of the decree based on the organization of the highest military authorities from 7 January 1921, which enables the free management of the [[Ministry of War]] without the vote of the government and the parliament. On 9 June 1926 the decree was officially restored, however, another decree was adopted, which increased the power of the president or head of state over the ministry. Bartel met with representatives of the parliamentary clubs, highlighting, in a conversation with them, his commitment towards the parliamentary system, but also pointed out a more concerning issue&nbsp;\u2013 the economic development of the country. At a private meeting with senators he highlighted his determination and involvement in fighting against bureaucracy, the introduction of apolitical army and the elimination of the Ministry of Public Works. He vividly stated that before the May Coup there was no democracy and Poland was ruled by [[oligarchy]], [[nobles]] and influential leaders of wealthy, privately owned clubs and parties.\n\nThe supporters of Kazimierz Bartel and his government emphasized his efficiency when managing the state. His opponents, however, saw it as a tool to limit the role of the Polish Parliament and accused him of deliberate dictatorship and control over the ministers in his \"private parliament sittings\" - the so-called ''Sejm Bartlowy'' (Bartel's Parliament). Bartel was appointed prime minister when Marshal Pi\u0142sudski undertook an attempt to communicate with the rebellious senators and members of the Sejm. Bartel himself was considered to be representative of the liberal tendencies in the party and a spokesman of the [[Sanacja]] movement. Otherwise the post of the head of government (Prime Minister) was either taken by [[Kazimierz \u015awitalski]] or [[Walery S\u0142awek]], both considered to be uncompromising supporters of the conflict with the parliament.<ref name=\"szkolnictwo.pl\"/><ref name=\"rp.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/692845.html?print=tak|title=Kazimierz Bartel \u2013premier od \u0142agodzenia napi\u0119\u0107 - Opinie - rp.pl|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBartel's government contributed to a marked improvement in administration. This was primarily caused by the Prime Minister's organizational skills and knowledge. He was able to create an efficient system of government action in connection with the Sejm and officials of lower rank: \"The ministers of the previous governments generally considered themselves as autonomous rulers, which influenced the private interests of the members of different parties in charge. The government of Kazimierz Bartel was never focused or concentrated on any political ties and friendships. The officials of the Prime Minister were to validate the efficiency of each ministry. Each minister was responsible for the operation of his office and ministers could not engage in any political activities. Before his speech in the parliament of any topic, he had to submit the text to the Prime Minister himself for approval. Bartel demanded such procedures from every minister and senator of his cabinet and personally prepared the agenda for each meeting of the government and disallowed to discuss any topic without his permission or consent.\"\n\nBartel also tried to improve the situation of the [[Polish Jews]] and the Jewish minority around the country. He was determined to eliminate the remnants of regulations dating back to the times of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Congress Poland]], focused on the persecution of religious minorities, especially the Jews and the [[Gypsies]]. Bartel's cabinet announced that it is against such inhumane procedures and actions, and in 1927 the Prime Minister gave permission to adopt a law officially recognizing and granting rights to the Jewish communities. Bartel was also against enforcing certain laws to the nature of the economic sanctions imposed on the Jews.\n[[File:Daszy\u0144ski i Bartel.jpg|thumb|right|Bartel (right) with [[Marshal of the Sejm]] [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]], 1929]]\nOn 2 August 1926 the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution (the so-called \"August Novella\"), significantly strengthening the role of the president. On 20 September 1926 the Christian Democratic Party raised a vote against two ministers in the government of Kazimierz Bartel&nbsp;\u2013 Antoni Sujkowski and Kazimierz M\u0142odzianowski. The party accused them of carrying out political purges in the state administration. Eventually the vote was passed by the government; this forced Bartel and his cabinet to resign, however, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski ordered President Mo\u015bcicki to appoint Bartel as Prime Minister once more as this was not in violation of the Constitution, but the anti-parliamentarian speakers and the socialist politicians, confused with the often changes in the administration and within the government, threatened the Sejm and even suggested a rebellion or another coup. Due to this conflict Bartel's third new cabinet only lasted four days.\n\nOn 30 September at the [[Belweder|Belvedere palace]] in [[Warsaw]], the council was holding a meeting in the study room, during which it was decided to dissolve the third government. Therefore, Bartel received the document on this subject, which for its validity required President Mo\u015bcicki's signature. Meanwhile, the Senate immediately demanded that the parliament passes the budget cut policy proposed by the Upper House. Bartel told the Speaker of the Sejm [[Maciej Rataj]], that in such situation he will personally take the decree to Mo\u015bcicki and ask for his signature. After the Sejm passed the budget cut policy, Bartel arrived at Mo\u015bcicki's [[Sulej\u00f3wek|private residence]], but to his surprise, Mo\u015bcicki refused to sign the document allowing the dissolution. Instead he ordered Bartel to terminate his employment. Bartel was once again forced to resign, but this time his cabinet would stay intact and his place would be taken by the marshal himself. The former prime minister was very bitter about this turn of events, despite the fact he went along with Pi\u0142sudski's and Rataj's plans. In its course the [[Marshal of Poland|Marshal]] warned that, in contrast to the previous government, he will not be \"competing\" with the ministers and if necessary he will use force if the members would not agree to his radical policies.\n\n===Collaboration with Pi\u0142sudski's Council===\nFollowing his resignation, Bartel was to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in Pi\u0142sudski's own, private council that operated in case of any unexpected conflict with the current operating government. The Marshal did not devote much attention towards his cabinet, focusing primarily on military and foreign policies. It was Kazimierz Bartel that was to replace the Marshal and take over his duties if absent and become the Speaker of the Sejm. He often spoke, as a representative of the government, on matters related to the budget and finances. These topics were the possibly the main subject of a dispute between the \"Pi\u0142sudskites\" and the parliamentary opposition.\n\nAfter the elections in March 1928, Pi\u0142sudski decided that Kazimierz Bartel should be appointed to the position of Speaker of the Sejm. On 27 March the \"[[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]]\" (BBWR), an ostensibly non-political organization that existed from 1928 to 1935, closely affiliated with J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and his [[Sanacja]] movement, declared Bartel's candidacy. However Pi\u0142sudski's plan to place Bartel in charge of the Sejm and nominate him as Marshal Speaker failed, because the senators and members of parliament decided to choose [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]] of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] as the Marshal of the Sejm instead. In protest, following the results of the vote, the members and supporters of the parliamentary BBWR party left the room.\n\nThe year 1928 also marked the release of his first book \"Perspektywa Malarska\". It dealt with the basic theory of perspective and its extension to architecture and art. It was published by  Ksiaznica-Atlas, a publisher in Lw\u00f3w who provided the negatives for the German translation published by B.G. Teubner in 1934.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n===Second term in office (1928\u20131929)===\nAs soon as the new government was formed without Kazimierz Bartel as its head, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, temporarily serving as Prime Minister of the country, resigned. He decided, however, that his position will be taken over by Kazimierz Bartel, considered his most trusted and most loyal friend and supporter among the members of the party, although this change was only formal&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel was already responsible for leading the ongoing work of the Council of Ministers, even if he was not the Head of Cabinet. Pi\u0142sudski's decision greatly dissatisfied the senators of parliament, who would simply demonstrate their anger by not participating in the sessions and sittings of the Sejm. Some politicians dared to even throw rotten food at the ministers that were leaving the voting chamber. The situation worsened in the upcoming months and some ministers raised concerns about their safety, as some demonstrators, often made up of ordinary citizens working on the behalf of the party, tended to physically abuse officials travelling from their homes to the newly constructed government building located on Wiejska Street in [[Warsaw]]. Similar events occurred during the inauguration of the first [[President of Poland|President of the Second Polish Republic]], [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], in December 1922. The politicians and ministers were advised to travel with guards, [[Policja|police]] or at least a weapon that they could defend themselves with, however, the use of weapons may have strengthened the unity of the opposition and of the demonstrators that could use this as an act of [[Protests|violence]] against the common people and a violation of social [[democracy]].\n\nAfter the beginning of the so-called \"Czechowicz affair\", where the opposition discovered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gabriel Czechowicz, a strong admirer of Pi\u0142sudski, passed 8 million [[Polish z\u0142oty]] from the state budget for the BBWR campaign between 1927 and 1928, on 12 February 1929 the members of an anti-Sanacja movement have requested to place both Czechowicz and Bartel before the State Tribunal (Court). In protest against this decision, Kazimierz Bartel informed the press of his intention to resign. He also stated that in his opinion the Czechowicz affair was caused by the Parliament and its senators rather than by the doings of one politician. On 13 April 1929 Bartel ordered his government to resign. He was replaced by [[Kazimierz \u015awitalski]], a stubborn and self-centred man considered to be the cause of relentless struggle with the parliamentary opposition. The following months were marked by disputes between the newly formed government and the Sejm. Bartel's new cabinet began operating 5 November 1929, however, its first sitting occurred in December on the orders of President Mo\u015bcicki. After this, the Parliament adopted a [[motion of no confidence]] against \u015awitalski's Cabinet. Kazimierz Bartel became the Prime Minister once again.\n\n===Third term in office (1929\u20131930)===\n[[File:V Rz\u0105d Bartla 29.12.1929.jpg|thumb|right|Bartel's fifth cabinet, December 1929. In center:  [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]].]]\nOn 29 December 1929 Kazimierz Bartel was chosen for the third time to be Prime Minister and formed his fifth government and cabinet, however, he performed his duties with large uncertainties, mainly due to poor health. He had kidney illness and had a ureterolithotomy with help from [[Tadeusz Pisarski]], a urologist he befriended during their conscription in the army.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02694.x The beginnings of urology in Krak\u00f3w: on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Clinic of Urology]</ref> He also suffered from depression and anxiety probably due to the constant disputes with the [[Sejm]] and its senators. On 10 January he appeared at a meeting with members of parliament, declaring his willingness to cooperate with the senators and the Sejm, saying \"I come with good will and determination gentlemen!\" Bartel initially managed to establish a cooperation with the Sejm, which resulted in the stabilization of the entire situation and conflict. Later, however, the relations between the cabinet and the parliament deteriorated again. The apogee of another dispute was a request for the adoption of no-confidence motion against Minister of Labour and Social Welfare [[Aleksander Prystor]]. This was done primarily through the initiative of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] headed by Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski and his supporters like [[Boles\u0142aw Limanowski]], a Polish socialist politician, as well as historian and journalist and advocate of [[Agrarianism]], who was the oldest member of the [[Polish Senate]] until his death in 1935 at the age of 99.\n\nOn 12 March Bartel gave a speech in the Senate sharply attacking the senators, which, in his opinion were \"not able to fulfill the tasks set in order to control the state and the country and that their stubbornness and pride in themselves was an astonishing blow to both the economy and the policies of Poland.\" He also stated that \"being a member of parliament is a profession. It does not require the members to acquire any skills and create new damaging campaigns, only to obey the ruling party. A man focused only on work and career often becomes a man in conflict with others, which entails long political consequences.\" Bartel believed that the [[motion of no confidence]] towards one member of the Senate is the lack of support of the entire government. On 15 March 1930 he decided to leave the office and his resignation was accepted by the president the next day. Soon after he also resigned from his parliamentary seat and left politics. [[Walery S\u0142awek]] was appointed the new Prime Minister of Poland.<ref name=\"dziennik.pl\"/>\n\n==Post-candidacy and return to the university==\nAfter retiring from political life, he returned to the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Technical University of Lw\u00f3w]] (Polytechnic). In the same year he was elected rector of the university and held that office in the academic year of 1930/1931. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate and membership of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]: in the years 1930-1932 he was president of the Polish Mathematical Society. During this time he published his most important works, including a series of lectures on the perspective of European painting. It was the first such publication in the world. During his work at the Technical University of Lw\u00f3w, he expressed strong opposition to plans focused on introducing the so-called \"ghetto benches\" for students of Jewish origin and ethnicity to separate them from Polish and Christian peers. His opinions, as well as other actions against anti-Semitic students made Kazimierz Bartel the subject of numerous attacks including throwing eggs and rotten food at the professor or bringing a pig with the sign \"Bartel\" by [[Nationalism|Polish nationalists]] to the university grounds.\n\nIn 1932, he testified as a witness in the [[Brest trials]], lasting from 26 October 1931 to 13 January 1932, held at the Warsaw Regional Court where leaders of the [[Centrolew]], a \"Centre-Left\" anti-Sanacja-government political-opposition movement, were tried. In 1937 Bartel was appointed Senator of Poland by the President (replacing the deceased Emil Bobrowski) and served until the outbreak of World War II. In the autumn of 1938 he was one of the signatories of a document addressed to the President Mo\u015bcicki, which called for the inclusion of representatives of the opposition to the government in connection with the threat of the country's independence. This document also postulated amnesty for politicians of the opposition, who were forced into exile or were imprisoned after the Brest trials. Bartel handed over a memorandum to Mo\u015bcicki, however, Mo\u015bcicki did not respond to the proposals contained therein. In February 1939 Bartel delivered a speech in the Senate, which has gained wide publicity in the country. In it he sharply criticized the situation in universities and colleges around Poland, mentioning the widespread [[anti-Semitism]] there, and also the failed organization of studies, subjects and courses.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:PL-Kazimierz Bartel.jpg|thumb|140px|Bartel, 1928]]\nIn [[Invasion of Poland|September 1939]], during the defense of Lw\u00f3w just before the attack of the German troops, Kazimierz Bartel served as the head of the Civic Committee. When Lw\u00f3w became occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical University. In July 1940 he was, along with several other politicians and professors, summoned to [[Moscow]], where he took part in an All-Committee meeting of Universities of the USSR. Conversations and topics mentioned mostly related scientific issues&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel signed a contract with a publishing house to write a textbook of Science and Geometry for the schools of the Soviet Union. He also visited the scientific and cultural institutions like the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]  and the [[MArchI|Institute of Architecture in Moscow]]. There are some conflicting reports about whether during his stay in Moscow, the Soviets offered him political cooperation. According to some of his closest friends, Stalin issued a proposal for the creation of a new Polish government, but Bartel rejected it. As he wrote to his wife on 16 July 1941: \"By listening to private conversations of the officers, I conclude that my position as Prime Minister may be resurrected, but what great duty this will be to control a split, communist country. In Moscow with [[Joseph Stalin]], I had the pleasure of finding out new information from the West - [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech addressed to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] about Poland's supposed future.\"\n\nOne of the editions of \"Paris' Historical Notebooks\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kulturaparyska.com/en/historia/polityka-wydawnicza|title=Editorial Policy|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> described the content of the letter sent to the [[German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It stated that M\u00fcller, the Deputy Head of the Security Police and Security Service ([[Reinhard Heydrich]]) believed that Bartel negotiated at the beginning of 1941 with the Soviet authorities about the establishment of a new nation that together with the Soviet Union was to declare war on [[Nazi Germany]]. Similar information can be found, among others, in a telegram sent by the Polish Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in [[Switzerland]] to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London dating from 26 September 1940: \"It's believed that Moscow professor Bartel has intention to create the Red Government of Poland.\" This information, however, was never proved to be true. Meanwhile, Maria Bartlowa, the wife of former Prime Minister, stated that her husband was talking only with the Soviets on the release of his new lecture book. It is also widely believed that Kazimierz Bartel never met Stalin in person.\n\nThe Prime Minister-in-exile stationing in London, General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], had plans to cooperate with Kazimierz Bartel and appoint him ambassador. Sikorski recognized him as one of the few people from the former political circles, that would agree to cooperate on the terms and conditions of the British government. On 19 June 1941 Bartel's candidacy was officially reported by Sikorski during a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was motivated by the political loyalty of the former Prime Minister, as well as his successful efforts to preserve the Polish character of the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic under Soviet occupation. Sikorski, however, failed to find Bartel in the USSR and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kot]] was appointed ambassador instead.\n\n===Arrest and death===\nOn 30 June 1941, soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], the [[Wehrmacht]] entered Lw\u00f3w. Bartel was arrested on 2 July while being in a meeting with co-workers at the University. Thirty-six other colleagues in the faculty were arrested the next night.<ref name=deregowski/> Bartel was taken initially to a Gestapo prison on Pelczy\u0144ska street. There, as mentioned by inmate Antoni Stefanowicz, he was treated properly. The former Prime Minister was allowed to receive and send letters and mathematical books and papers to his wife and to bring food from home. At that time, Bartel was not questioned, because there were some issues regarding the accusations made by the [[Gestapo]]. On 21 July, however, he was transferred to a [[prison at \u0141\u0105ckiego]] Street, where he was treated poorly; the guards called him a Commie-Jew, as reported by Stefanowicz, and the Nazi officials ordered Bartel to clean the boots of a Ukrainian Hilfsgestapo soldier. Stefanowicz reported that Bartel was mentally devastated and could not understand the essence of this tragedy.\n\nAccording to some sources, the Nazi officials proposed the establishment of a Polish puppet government dependent on the Reich. Such information was given by General Sikorski during a press conference in [[Cairo]] in November 1941 (on the way to Moscow). According to his version, Bartel refused, and on the orders of [[Heinrich Himmler]] was executed on 26 July 1941 at dawn. He was shot probably near ''Piaski Janowskie'' in the context of the [[Massacre of Lviv professors|Massacre of Lw\u00f3w professors]].<ref name=\"polskieradio.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/896485,Kazimierz-Bartel-premier-i-meczennik|title=Kazimierz Bartel - premier i m\u0119czennik|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> Being barred from her daily delivery of food to her husband on the Saturday of 26 June, Bartel's wife learned of Bartel's shooting death the next Monday.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\nAccording to one account, during the night of October 1943 the [[Sonderkommando]] composed of Jewish prisoners unearthed the bodies of the murdered Polish professors that were filed in a mass grave. This was carried out in order to remove the traces of the murder, in connection with the approaching Soviet troops. On 9 October 1943 the corpses were piled. The prisoners were forced to take any personal belongings and clothes, including documents of Kazimierz Bartel and Professor Tadeusz Ostrowski. Later the pile of corpses was set on fire and in the following days the Sonderkommando scattered the ashes on the surrounding fields.<ref name=\"polskieradio.pl\"/><ref name=\"rp.pl\"/>\n\nIn 1966, on the 25th anniversary of the execution of Lw\u00f3w professors, a plaque with the names of the victims of Nazism was placed on the church of St. Francis of Assisi in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Next to memorial there is also a separate epitaph in honor of Kazimierz Bartel.\n\n==After death==\nKnowing the importance Bartel gave to his work on perspective, his wife was able to save his manuscript after his death by begging from the Nazi officials. Bartel's library of books were either shipped with some pieces of furniture to Germany or burned with his personal papers. His second book was supposed to be published first in German by B. G. Teubner, who would provide Ksiaznica-Atlas the negatives for the Polish edition. However, war delayed the printing and ultimately caused the destruction of all materials. In the 1950s, The second book was reconstructed in the 1950s by Professor F. Otto of the University of Gdansk using the surviving manuscript and the printer's proofs which Teubner had sent for Bartel's approval. The second book dealt with analyzing pictures geometrically, artistic reconstruction of geometry exhibited in pictures, and tracing art history using tenets of his theory of perspective. A uniform series was released by Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe, the second book in 1958 and the first volume in 1960.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nHe was decorated with, among others, the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (1932) for outstanding achievements, the French [[Legion of Honour]] (class I), the [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]], the [[Cross of Independence]] and the Silver Cross of the [[Virtuti Militari]] (1922).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Kazimierz Bartel}}\n* [http://delibra.bg.polsl.pl/Content/25238/BCPS_28784_1931_Rzuty-cechowane.pdf Rzuty cechowane]\n* [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/1939-1945/NURNBERG/np5.txt_Piece40.04 N\u00fcrnberg.

Growing up in a working class family, he graduated from elementary school in [[Stryi|Stryj]]. His railwayman father arranged Bartel to be an apprentice to fitter who taught in craft school. This allowed Bartel to continue his formal education while working as an apprentice.<ref name=deregowski>[https://psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/106 Kazimierz Bartel (1882-1941) by J. B. Deregowski]</ref>\n\nAfter completing secondary school in 1901, Bartel studied mechanics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic]] in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He graduated summa cum laude in 1907 and soon started working for his alma mater as an assistant in descriptive geometry to Placyd Zdzis\u0142aw Dziwinski.<ref name=mactutor>[http://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bartel.html MacTutor biography]</ref> From 1908 to 1909, he also studied mathematics and philosophy at the Franciscan University in Lviv and at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. The travel grant to Munich allowed him to attend the lectures on art history by Karl Dochlemann and mathematics by Aurel Voss and [[Alfred Pringsheim]].<ref name=deregowski/> He returned to the Polytechnic school and earned his doctor of technical sciences in 1909. His dissertation \"O utworach szereg\u00f3w i p\u0119k\u00f3w inwolucyjnych\" (Compositions series and involution pencils) allowed him to become one of the first title holders of such doctoral within Austria-Hungary.

In 1919, as commander of [[railway troops]], he fought in the defence of the city against the Ukrainian [[siege]]. During this period, Bartel wrote his first textbook on descriptive geometry<ref name=deregowski/> and befriended and later supported Poland's future leader, [[Marshal of Poland|marshal]] and commander-in-chief, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Since May 1919 he served as the manager of the Armoured Trains Construction Management and Association. His numerous successes in this field led to Prime Minister [[Leopold Skulski]] appointing him the Minister of the Railway system of the Republic of Poland. During this time Bartel met other significant and influential politicians and diplomats, most notably Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]] and Prime Minister [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]]. Following the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1920, Bartel was nominated as a lieutenant colonel and was left in charge of the railway reserve officers and the Lw\u00f3w [[militia]].<ref name=\"klp.pl\"/> He was awarded a [[Virtuti Militari]] cross, a Polish distinction for valor, after the armed conflict.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\nIm 1921, Bartel spent six months travelling to museums and galleries in France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to research on art. Most of his holidays were spent likewise due to his interest stemming from Dochlemann's lectures. He accumulated a good personal archive of notes and photographs for this interest of his.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nIn 1922 Bartel was elected a member of Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' (parliament) and held this position until 1929. Initially, he was a member of the party PSL \"Liberation\", but he was not satisfied with the radicalization of the group. In March 1925 at the Congress of the Polish People's Party he decided to adopt, among others, a reform without compensation. Bartel eventually left the party and the organisation in April 1925, along with [[Marian Zyndram-Ko\u015bcia\u0142kowski]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Wys\u0142ouch]] and later founded the parliamentary \"Labour Club\". This organization quickly came under the direct influence of commander-in-chief [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Just before the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 Kazimierz Bartel received an order from Marshal Pi\u0142sudski to prepare for a take over as prime minister after the expected collapse of President [[Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski]] and his government.<ref name=\"szkolnictwo.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.szkolnictwo.pl/szukaj,Kazimierz_Bartel|title=Kazimierz Bartel - Szkolnictwo.pl|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===First term in office, first government (1926)===\nOn 15 May 1926, after the resignation of the government led by [[Wincenty Witos]] and president Wojciechowski following the May Coup, Bartel was appointed by [[Marshal of the Sejm]] and the acting head of state [[Maciej Rataj]] as the prime minister of the Second Polish Republic, although, Bartel later stated in his inauguration speech that he would only be the head of government until the election of a new president. His decision was possibly influenced by the fact that he suffered from kidney and stomach problems and was constantly in pain. One member of the parliament stated that \"He was a cheerful and ambitious man, but always in pain. Even his opponents in the Sejm admitted that in personal relationships, it is extremely hard not to be in favour of a man like Bartel. As prime minister, he tried to aid every man possible, even the men and women that opposed his policies and the government, but he was not able to help himself, which led to his early decline in politics and diplomacy of the Polish Republic. He was of weak stature and of weak health and would hardly make a good impression on the public, especially the socialists or communists in the east and therefore, this would not make him an influential Prime Minister nor a diplomat supporting democracy.\"\n[[File:Kazimierz Bartel.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, 1928]]\nBartel's new government consisted mostly of people not connected with any political parties (four of those politicians already were occupied ministerial positions). Bartel was described as ideologically centrist&nbsp;\u2013 Prime Minister's newly established office was occupied by both the right-wing leaders and left. Bartel himself took over the Ministry in turn, and Pi\u0142sudski the Minister of War. Such a system churned mainly the [[Polish Socialist Party]], which supported the May Coup. On 16 May 1926, Prime Minister Bartel made a statement in which he highlighted the principles of his policies. Bartel stated that the cabinet took power in accordance with the law, without any [[prejudice]] to the constitutional order. He also called for peace, hard work and dedication to the [[Poland|Polish nation]]. At the same time he promised the immediate removal of incompetent and corrupt politicians from any high posts that could negatively influence the future economic growth of the Second Polish Republic. Bartel's closest personal advisor in politics and diplomacy was Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who was in favour of the new minister.<ref name=\"dziennik.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/historia/ksiazki/artykuly/476383,kazimierz-bartel-polski-premier-ktorego-kusil-adolf-hitler-mariusz-urbanek-lwowska-szkola-matematyczna-recenzja.html|title=Polski premier, kt\u00f3rego kusi\u0142 Hitler|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBartel suggested that [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] should become a candidate for the post of head of state (president), who was also a professor at the [[Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic]]. Bartel's first government was one of the most active in the history of Poland; the politicians and members of parliament gathered every second day and on occasions everyday to discuss political matters. On 4 June 1926 Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki was elected the president of the Second Polish Republic and subsequently Bartel resigned along with the entire cabinet, however, soon after being appointed President Mo\u015bcicki designated him again to become Prime Minister.\n\n===Second and third government (1926)===\nOn 8 June 1926&nbsp;\u2013 three days after the Mo\u015bcicki's designation&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel formed his second cabinet. On the same day J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski sent a letter to the head office, in which he outlined the conditions re-entry to the parliament. Following his second election, Kazimierz Bartel primarily focused on the restoration of the decree based on the organization of the highest military authorities from 7 January 1921, which enables the free management of the [[Ministry of War]] without the vote of the government and the parliament. On 9 June 1926 the decree was officially restored, however, another decree was adopted, which increased the power of the president or head of state over the ministry. Bartel met with representatives of the parliamentary clubs, highlighting, in a conversation with them, his commitment towards the parliamentary system, but also pointed out a more concerning issue&nbsp;\u2013 the economic development of the country. At a private meeting with senators he highlighted his determination and involvement in fighting against bureaucracy, the introduction of apolitical army and the elimination of the Ministry of Public Works. He vividly stated that before the May Coup there was no democracy and Poland was ruled by [[oligarchy]], [[nobles]] and influential leaders of wealthy, privately owned clubs and parties.\n\nThe supporters of Kazimierz Bartel and his government emphasized his efficiency when managing the state. His opponents, however, saw it as a tool to limit the role of the Polish Parliament and accused him of deliberate dictatorship and control over the ministers in his \"private parliament sittings\" - the so-called ''Sejm Bartlowy'' (Bartel's Parliament). Bartel was appointed prime minister when Marshal Pi\u0142sudski undertook an attempt to communicate with the rebellious senators and members of the Sejm. Bartel himself was considered to be representative of the liberal tendencies in the party and a spokesman of the [[Sanacja]] movement. Otherwise the post of the head of government (Prime Minister) was either taken by [[Kazimierz \u015awitalski]] or [[Walery S\u0142awek]], both considered to be uncompromising supporters of the conflict with the parliament.<ref name=\"szkolnictwo.pl\"/><ref name=\"rp.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/692845.html?print=tak|title=Kazimierz Bartel \u2013premier od \u0142agodzenia napi\u0119\u0107 - Opinie - rp.pl|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBartel's government contributed to a marked improvement in administration. This was primarily caused by the Prime Minister's organizational skills and knowledge. He was able to create an efficient system of government action in connection with the Sejm and officials of lower rank: \"The ministers of the previous governments generally considered themselves as autonomous rulers, which influenced the private interests of the members of different parties in charge. The government of Kazimierz Bartel was never focused or concentrated on any political ties and friendships. The officials of the Prime Minister were to validate the efficiency of each ministry. Each minister was responsible for the operation of his office and ministers could not engage in any political activities. Before his speech in the parliament of any topic, he had to submit the text to the Prime Minister himself for approval. Bartel demanded such procedures from every minister and senator of his cabinet and personally prepared the agenda for each meeting of the government and disallowed to discuss any topic without his permission or consent.\"\n\nBartel also tried to improve the situation of the [[Polish Jews]] and the Jewish minority around the country. He was determined to eliminate the remnants of regulations dating back to the times of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Congress Poland]], focused on the persecution of religious minorities, especially the Jews and the [[Gypsies]]. Bartel's cabinet announced that it is against such inhumane procedures and actions, and in 1927 the Prime Minister gave permission to adopt a law officially recognizing and granting rights to the Jewish communities. Bartel was also against enforcing certain laws to the nature of the economic sanctions imposed on the Jews.\n[[File:Daszy\u0144ski i Bartel.jpg|thumb|right|Bartel (right) with [[Marshal of the Sejm]] [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]], 1929]]\nOn 2 August 1926 the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution (the so-called \"August Novella\"), significantly strengthening the role of the president. On 20 September 1926 the Christian Democratic Party raised a vote against two ministers in the government of Kazimierz Bartel&nbsp;\u2013 Antoni Sujkowski and Kazimierz M\u0142odzianowski. The party accused them of carrying out political purges in the state administration. Eventually the vote was passed by the government; this forced Bartel and his cabinet to resign, however, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski ordered President Mo\u015bcicki to appoint Bartel as Prime Minister once more as this was not in violation of the Constitution, but the anti-parliamentarian speakers and the socialist politicians, confused with the often changes in the administration and within the government, threatened the Sejm and even suggested a rebellion or another coup. Due to this conflict Bartel's third new cabinet only lasted four days.\n\nOn 30 September at the [[Belweder|Belvedere palace]] in [[Warsaw]], the council was holding a meeting in the study room, during which it was decided to dissolve the third government. Therefore, Bartel received the document on this subject, which for its validity required President Mo\u015bcicki's signature. Meanwhile, the Senate immediately demanded that the parliament passes the budget cut policy proposed by the Upper House. Bartel told the Speaker of the Sejm [[Maciej Rataj]], that in such situation he will personally take the decree to Mo\u015bcicki and ask for his signature. After the Sejm passed the budget cut policy, Bartel arrived at Mo\u015bcicki's [[Sulej\u00f3wek|private residence]], but to his surprise, Mo\u015bcicki refused to sign the document allowing the dissolution. Instead he ordered Bartel to terminate his employment. Bartel was once again forced to resign, but this time his cabinet would stay intact and his place would be taken by the marshal himself. The former prime minister was very bitter about this turn of events, despite the fact he went along with Pi\u0142sudski's and Rataj's plans. In its course the [[Marshal of Poland|Marshal]] warned that, in contrast to the previous government, he will not be \"competing\" with the ministers and if necessary he will use force if the members would not agree to his radical policies.\n\n===Collaboration with Pi\u0142sudski's Council===\nFollowing his resignation, Bartel was to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in Pi\u0142sudski's own, private council that operated in case of any unexpected conflict with the current operating government. The Marshal did not devote much attention towards his cabinet, focusing primarily on military and foreign policies. It was Kazimierz Bartel that was to replace the Marshal and take over his duties if absent and become the Speaker of the Sejm. He often spoke, as a representative of the government, on matters related to the budget and finances. These topics were the possibly the main subject of a dispute between the \"Pi\u0142sudskites\" and the parliamentary opposition.\n\nAfter the elections in March 1928, Pi\u0142sudski decided that Kazimierz Bartel should be appointed to the position of Speaker of the Sejm. On 27 March the \"[[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]]\" (BBWR), an ostensibly non-political organization that existed from 1928 to 1935, closely affiliated with J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and his [[Sanacja]] movement, declared Bartel's candidacy. However Pi\u0142sudski's plan to place Bartel in charge of the Sejm and nominate him as Marshal Speaker failed, because the senators and members of parliament decided to choose [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]] of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] as the Marshal of the Sejm instead. In protest, following the results of the vote, the members and supporters of the parliamentary BBWR party left the room.\n\nThe year 1928 also marked the release of his first book \"Perspektywa Malarska\". It dealt with the basic theory of perspective and its extension to architecture and art. It was published by  Ksiaznica-Atlas, a publisher in Lw\u00f3w who provided the negatives for the German translation published by B.G. Teubner in 1934.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n===Second term in office (1928\u20131929)===\nAs soon as the new government was formed without Kazimierz Bartel as its head, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, temporarily serving as Prime Minister of the country, resigned. He decided, however, that his position will be taken over by Kazimierz Bartel, considered his most trusted and most loyal friend and supporter among the members of the party, although this change was only formal&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel was already responsible for leading the ongoing work of the Council of Ministers, even if he was not the Head of Cabinet. Pi\u0142sudski's decision greatly dissatisfied the senators of parliament, who would simply demonstrate their anger by not participating in the sessions and sittings of the Sejm. Some politicians dared to even throw rotten food at the ministers that were leaving the voting chamber. The situation worsened in the upcoming months and some ministers raised concerns about their safety, as some demonstrators, often made up of ordinary citizens working on the behalf of the party, tended to physically abuse officials travelling from their homes to the newly constructed government building located on Wiejska Street in [[Warsaw]]. Similar events occurred during the inauguration of the first [[President of Poland|President of the Second Polish Republic]], [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], in December 1922. The politicians and ministers were advised to travel with guards, [[Policja|police]] or at least a weapon that they could defend themselves with, however, the use of weapons may have strengthened the unity of the opposition and of the demonstrators that could use this as an act of [[Protests|violence]] against the common people and a violation of social [[democracy]].\n\nAfter the beginning of the so-called \"Czechowicz affair\", where the opposition discovered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gabriel Czechowicz, a strong admirer of Pi\u0142sudski, passed 8 million [[Polish z\u0142oty]] from the state budget for the BBWR campaign between 1927 and 1928, on 12 February 1929 the members of an anti-Sanacja movement have requested to place both Czechowicz and Bartel before the State Tribunal (Court). In protest against this decision, Kazimierz Bartel informed the press of his intention to resign. He also stated that in his opinion the Czechowicz affair was caused by the Parliament and its senators rather than by the doings of one politician. On 13 April 1929 Bartel ordered his government to resign. He was replaced by [[Kazimierz \u015awitalski]], a stubborn and self-centred man considered to be the cause of relentless struggle with the parliamentary opposition. The following months were marked by disputes between the newly formed government and the Sejm. Bartel's new cabinet began operating 5 November 1929, however, its first sitting occurred in December on the orders of President Mo\u015bcicki. After this, the Parliament adopted a [[motion of no confidence]] against \u015awitalski's Cabinet. Kazimierz Bartel became the Prime Minister once again.\n\n===Third term in office (1929\u20131930)===\n[[File:V Rz\u0105d Bartla 29.12.1929.jpg|thumb|right|Bartel's fifth cabinet, December 1929. In center:  [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]].]]\nOn 29 December 1929 Kazimierz Bartel was chosen for the third time to be Prime Minister and formed his fifth government and cabinet, however, he performed his duties with large uncertainties, mainly due to poor health. He had kidney illness and had a ureterolithotomy with help from [[Tadeusz Pisarski]], a urologist he befriended during their conscription in the army.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02694.x The beginnings of urology in Krak\u00f3w: on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Clinic of Urology]</ref> He also suffered from depression and anxiety probably due to the constant disputes with the [[Sejm]] and its senators. On 10 January he appeared at a meeting with members of parliament, declaring his willingness to cooperate with the senators and the Sejm, saying \"I come with good will and determination gentlemen!\" Bartel initially managed to establish a cooperation with the Sejm, which resulted in the stabilization of the entire situation and conflict. Later, however, the relations between the cabinet and the parliament deteriorated again. The apogee of another dispute was a request for the adoption of no-confidence motion against Minister of Labour and Social Welfare [[Aleksander Prystor]]. This was done primarily through the initiative of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] headed by Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski and his supporters like [[Boles\u0142aw Limanowski]], a Polish socialist politician, as well as historian and journalist and advocate of [[Agrarianism]], who was the oldest member of the [[Polish Senate]] until his death in 1935 at the age of 99.\n\nOn 12 March Bartel gave a speech in the Senate sharply attacking the senators, which, in his opinion were \"not able to fulfill the tasks set in order to control the state and the country and that their stubbornness and pride in themselves was an astonishing blow to both the economy and the policies of Poland.\" He also stated that \"being a member of parliament is a profession. It does not require the members to acquire any skills and create new damaging campaigns, only to obey the ruling party. A man focused only on work and career often becomes a man in conflict with others, which entails long political consequences.\" Bartel believed that the [[motion of no confidence]] towards one member of the Senate is the lack of support of the entire government. On 15 March 1930 he decided to leave the office and his resignation was accepted by the president the next day. Soon after he also resigned from his parliamentary seat and left politics. [[Walery S\u0142awek]] was appointed the new Prime Minister of Poland.<ref name=\"dziennik.pl\"/>\n\n==Post-candidacy and return to the university==\nAfter retiring from political life, he returned to the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Technical University of Lw\u00f3w]] (Polytechnic). In the same year he was elected rector of the university and held that office in the academic year of 1930/1931. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate and membership of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]: in the years 1930-1932 he was president of the Polish Mathematical Society. During this time he published his most important works, including a series of lectures on the perspective of European painting. It was the first such publication in the world. During his work at the Technical University of Lw\u00f3w, he expressed strong opposition to plans focused on introducing the so-called \"ghetto benches\" for students of Jewish origin and ethnicity to separate them from Polish and Christian peers. His opinions, as well as other actions against anti-Semitic students made Kazimierz Bartel the subject of numerous attacks including throwing eggs and rotten food at the professor or bringing a pig with the sign \"Bartel\" by [[Nationalism|Polish nationalists]] to the university grounds.\n\nIn 1932, he testified as a witness in the [[Brest trials]], lasting from 26 October 1931 to 13 January 1932, held at the Warsaw Regional Court where leaders of the [[Centrolew]], a \"Centre-Left\" anti-Sanacja-government political-opposition movement, were tried. In 1937 Bartel was appointed Senator of Poland by the President (replacing the deceased Emil Bobrowski) and served until the outbreak of World War II. In the autumn of 1938 he was one of the signatories of a document addressed to the President Mo\u015bcicki, which called for the inclusion of representatives of the opposition to the government in connection with the threat of the country's independence. This document also postulated amnesty for politicians of the opposition, who were forced into exile or were imprisoned after the Brest trials. Bartel handed over a memorandum to Mo\u015bcicki, however, Mo\u015bcicki did not respond to the proposals contained therein. In February 1939 Bartel delivered a speech in the Senate, which has gained wide publicity in the country. In it he sharply criticized the situation in universities and colleges around Poland, mentioning the widespread [[anti-Semitism]] there, and also the failed organization of studies, subjects and courses.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:PL-Kazimierz Bartel.jpg|thumb|140px|Bartel, 1928]]\nIn [[Invasion of Poland|September 1939]], during the defense of Lw\u00f3w just before the attack of the German troops, Kazimierz Bartel served as the head of the Civic Committee. When Lw\u00f3w became occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical University. In July 1940 he was, along with several other politicians and professors, summoned to [[Moscow]], where he took part in an All-Committee meeting of Universities of the USSR. Conversations and topics mentioned mostly related scientific issues&nbsp;\u2013 Bartel signed a contract with a publishing house to write a textbook of Science and Geometry for the schools of the Soviet Union. He also visited the scientific and cultural institutions like the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]  and the [[MArchI|Institute of Architecture in Moscow]]. There are some conflicting reports about whether during his stay in Moscow, the Soviets offered him political cooperation. According to some of his closest friends, Stalin issued a proposal for the creation of a new Polish government, but Bartel rejected it. As he wrote to his wife on 16 July 1941: \"By listening to private conversations of the officers, I conclude that my position as Prime Minister may be resurrected, but what great duty this will be to control a split, communist country. In Moscow with [[Joseph Stalin]], I had the pleasure of finding out new information from the West - [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech addressed to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] about Poland's supposed future.\"\n\nOne of the editions of \"Paris' Historical Notebooks\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kulturaparyska.com/en/historia/polityka-wydawnicza|title=Editorial Policy|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> described the content of the letter sent to the [[German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It stated that M\u00fcller, the Deputy Head of the Security Police and Security Service ([[Reinhard Heydrich]]) believed that Bartel negotiated at the beginning of 1941 with the Soviet authorities about the establishment of a new nation that together with the Soviet Union was to declare war on [[Nazi Germany]]. Similar information can be found, among others, in a telegram sent by the Polish Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in [[Switzerland]] to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London dating from 26 September 1940: \"It's believed that Moscow professor Bartel has intention to create the Red Government of Poland.\" This information, however, was never proved to be true. Meanwhile, Maria Bartlowa, the wife of former Prime Minister, stated that her husband was talking only with the Soviets on the release of his new lecture book. It is also widely believed that Kazimierz Bartel never met Stalin in person.\n\nThe Prime Minister-in-exile stationing in London, General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], had plans to cooperate with Kazimierz Bartel and appoint him ambassador. Sikorski recognized him as one of the few people from the former political circles, that would agree to cooperate on the terms and conditions of the British government. On 19 June 1941 Bartel's candidacy was officially reported by Sikorski during a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was motivated by the political loyalty of the former Prime Minister, as well as his successful efforts to preserve the Polish character of the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic under Soviet occupation. Sikorski, however, failed to find Bartel in the USSR and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kot]] was appointed ambassador instead.\n\n===Arrest and death===\nOn 30 June 1941, soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], the [[Wehrmacht]] entered Lw\u00f3w. Bartel was arrested on 2 July while being in a meeting with co-workers at the University. Thirty-six other colleagues in the faculty were arrested the next night.<ref name=deregowski/> Bartel was taken initially to a Gestapo prison on Pelczy\u0144ska street. There, as mentioned by inmate Antoni Stefanowicz, he was treated properly. The former Prime Minister was allowed to receive and send letters and mathematical books and papers to his wife and to bring food from home. At that time, Bartel was not questioned, because there were some issues regarding the accusations made by the [[Gestapo]]. On 21 July, however, he was transferred to a [[prison at \u0141\u0105ckiego]] Street, where he was treated poorly; the guards called him a Commie-Jew, as reported by Stefanowicz, and the Nazi officials ordered Bartel to clean the boots of a Ukrainian Hilfsgestapo soldier. Stefanowicz reported that Bartel was mentally devastated and could not understand the essence of this tragedy.\n\nAccording to some sources, the Nazi officials proposed the establishment of a Polish puppet government dependent on the Reich. Such information was given by General Sikorski during a press conference in [[Cairo]] in November 1941 (on the way to Moscow). According to his version, Bartel refused, and on the orders of [[Heinrich Himmler]] was executed on 26 July 1941 at dawn. He was shot probably near ''Piaski Janowskie'' in the context of the [[Massacre of Lviv professors|Massacre of Lw\u00f3w professors]].<ref name=\"polskieradio.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/896485,Kazimierz-Bartel-premier-i-meczennik|title=Kazimierz Bartel - premier i m\u0119czennik|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> Being barred from her daily delivery of food to her husband on the Saturday of 26 June, Bartel's wife learned of Bartel's shooting death the next Monday.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\nAccording to one account, during the night of October 1943 the [[Sonderkommando]] composed of Jewish prisoners unearthed the bodies of the murdered Polish professors that were filed in a mass grave. This was carried out in order to remove the traces of the murder, in connection with the approaching Soviet troops. On 9 October 1943 the corpses were piled. The prisoners were forced to take any personal belongings and clothes, including documents of Kazimierz Bartel and Professor Tadeusz Ostrowski. Later the pile of corpses was set on fire and in the following days the Sonderkommando scattered the ashes on the surrounding fields.<ref name=\"polskieradio.pl\"/><ref name=\"rp.pl\"/>\n\nIn 1966, on the 25th anniversary of the execution of Lw\u00f3w professors, a plaque with the names of the victims of Nazism was placed on the church of St. Francis of Assisi in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Next to memorial there is also a separate epitaph in honor of Kazimierz Bartel.\n\n==After death==\nKnowing the importance Bartel gave to his work on perspective, his wife was able to save his manuscript after his death by begging from the Nazi officials. Bartel's library of books were either shipped with some pieces of furniture to Germany or burned with his personal papers. His second book was supposed to be published first in German by B. G. Teubner, who would provide Ksiaznica-Atlas the negatives for the Polish edition. However, war delayed the printing and ultimately caused the destruction of all materials. In the 1950s, The second book was reconstructed in the 1950s by Professor F. Otto of the University of Gdansk using the surviving manuscript and the printer's proofs which Teubner had sent for Bartel's approval. The second book dealt with analyzing pictures geometrically, artistic reconstruction of geometry exhibited in pictures, and tracing art history using tenets of his theory of perspective. A uniform series was released by Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe, the second book in 1958 and the first volume in 1960.<ref name=deregowski/>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nHe was decorated with, among others, the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (1932) for outstanding achievements, the French [[Legion of Honour]] (class I), the [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]], the [[Cross of Independence]] and the Silver Cross of the [[Virtuti Militari]] (1922).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Kazimierz Bartel}}\n* [http://delibra.bg.polsl.pl/Content/25238/BCPS_28784_1931_Rzuty-cechowane.pdf Rzuty cechowane]\n* [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/1939-1945/NURNBERG/np5.txt_Piece40.04 N\u00fcrnberg.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref name=\"Maine1\" /> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref name=\"Dyer\" />  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref name=\"Maine1\" /> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

After travelling to England, he was posted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]] and was sent to France shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, flying [[Fairey Battle]]s on [[Aerial reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] missions into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. After his squadron returned to England and converted to [[Bristol Blenheim IV|Bristol Blenheim]]s, he flew several bombing missions during the [[Battle of France]]. Afterwards he spent several months on instructing duties before being posted to [[No. 487 Squadron RNZAF|No. 487 (NZ) Squadron]] in August 1942. He was shot down over [[Amsterdam]] while on a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on 3 May 1943, becoming a prisoner of war. \n\nAfter the war, he was awarded the VC for his actions during Ramrod 16. He continued to serve with the RAF and was commander of [[No. 214 Squadron RAF|No. 214 Squadron]] during the [[Suez Crisis]]. He retired in June 1965 and lived in Australia, and then New Zealand, in his later years. He died in 1986, aged 71. \n\n==Early life==\nLeonard Henry Trent was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand, on 14 April 1915, the son of Leonard Trent, a dentist, and his wife Irene {{nee|Everett}}.<ref name=\"Hayward 1\">{{DNZB|title=Trent, Leonard Henry|first= Joel|last= Hayward|id=5t20|accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> In April 1919 the family relocated to [[Takaka]], along the shore of [[Golden Bay]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=21}} Three years later, his father paid for Trent to take a short flight in a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]] piloted by [[Malcolm C. McGregor]], a [[fighter ace]] of the [[First World War]], and subsequently Trent became interested in flying.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=22\u201323}} He was educated at [[Nelson College]], boarding at the school from 1928.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=24}} Not particularly academically inclined he became increasingly interested in golf and in his final year at school, in 1934, won the Nelson Golf Club Senior Championship.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=25}}\n\nTrent had intended to go to university to study dentistry,{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=25}} but the family could not afford to pay for his studies and he instead took up a position as a clerk in the administrative office of an [[abattoir]] in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]]. He gave up the work after a year and returned to Nelson to assist his father in his dental practice.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=26}} After a time he moved to [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] taking up office work again. He was soon earning enough money that he could afford to go to night school and study aero engineering and maintenance.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=26}}\n\n==Early service career==\nIn early 1937, in response to an advertisement in a newspaper, Trent applied for a short-term [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=27}} He passed a selection interview and subsequent medical test and in August was accepted for flight training. Induction training was with the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) and was held at [[Taieri]], near [[Dunedin]],{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} where he flew [[Gipsy Moth]]s and [[Miles Magister]]s.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=27}} Trent then undertook flight training at the RNZAF's [[Wigram|Wigram Air Base]] in [[Christchurch]],{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} flying [[Avro 626]] and [[Vickers Vildebeest]] aircraft.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} He gained his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] on 12 May 1938 and a month later he sailed for Britain to join the RAF.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=36\u201337}} He was granted a short-service commission of five years in the rank of [[pilot officer]] on 23 August 1938.<ref>{{London Gazette|publication_link=London Gazette |issue=34548 |date=6 September 1938 |page=5678 |supp=}}</ref>\n\nPosted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]], which operated [[Fairey Battle]]s out of [[RAF Abingdon|Abingdon]] in [[Berkshire]], Trent spent the next few months learning bombing and reconnaissance flying techniques.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=38}} In February 1939, he spent three months at [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], near [[Southampton]], attending a navigation course. Here he met Ursula Woolhouse, while playing golf at the local club in his downtime.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=41}}\n\n==Second World War==\nIn early September 1939, following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], No. 15 Squadron flew to France as part of the [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=43}} Stationed at [[Vraux]], the squadron was to fly high-level [[Aerial reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] missions over enemy territory, collecting information on [[Nazi Germany|German]] airfields, factories and major infrastructure. Trent flew his first mission into Germany on 24 September 1939, No. 15 Squadron's first operational sortie of the war.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=44\u201345}} This period of the war was known as the [[Phoney War]], and much the squadron's flying revolved around training and practice bombing missions. The squadron was sent back to England in early December to convert to the [[Bristol Blenheim IV]], operating from [[RAF Wyton|Wyton]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=48}} \n\nInitial conversion work was on the [[Bristol Blenheim I]] and during this time Trent had to make an emergency landing, having become lost in overcast conditions while on a flight to Scotland.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=52\u201353}} In March 1940, he was promoted to [[flying officer]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34822 |date=2 April 1940 |page=1916 |supp=|nolink=y}}</ref> The squadron returned to operations when the Germans [[Battle of France|invaded France]] and the [[Low Countries]] on 10 May 1940.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=54}} That day he flew one of three aircraft that bombed German forces at an aerodrome near [[Rotterdam]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=55}} Further missions followed, including a bombing raid on bridges over the [[Albert Canal]] that saw six of the twelve participating aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=56\u201359}} On another mission, his aircraft suffered damage from [[flak]] and an attacking [[Messerschmitt Me 109]] fighter and he put down at an airfield on the way back to his base for repairs.

An [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV squadron]], much of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=210\u2013217}} Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=83\u201384}} The squadron was to operate [[Lockheed Ventura]]s; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crews were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at [[Eindhoven]]. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=288}}\n\nOn 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on a power station in [[Amsterdam]]. The mission was intended to be as a diversion to another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at [[Ijmuiden]]. \"Ramrod\" was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfires]]. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences.{{sfn|Thompson|1956|pp=143\u2013147}}{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|pp=288\u2013290}} \n[[Image:487 Squadron RNZAF NCOs RAF Methold early 1943.JPG|thumb|right|Non-commissioned officers of Trent's No. 487 Squadron, with a Ventura at RAF Methwold, early 1943]]\nOne Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Me 109s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Me 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Me 109 with the forward [[machine gun]]s of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his [[navigator]] were thrown clear at {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=off}} and became [[prisoners of war]] (POW).

This operation was intended to encourage the Dutch workmen in their resistance to enemy pressure and the target was known to be heavily defended. The importance of bombing it, regardless of enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire, was strongly impressed on the aircrews taking part in the operation. Before taking off Squadron Leader Trent told the deputy leader that he was going over the target whatever happened. All went well until the eleven Venturas and their fighter escort were nearing the Dutch Coast. Then one bomber was hit and had to turn back. Suddenly large numbers of enemy fighters appeared. Our escorting fighters were hotly engaged and lost touch with the bombing force. The Venturas closed up for mutual protection and commenced their run up to the target. Unfortunately the fighters detailed to support them over the target had reached the area too early and had been recalled. Soon the bombers were attacked. They were at the mercy of fifteen to twenty Messerschmitts which dived on them incessantly. Within four minutes six Venturas were destroyed. Squadron Leader Trent continued on his course with the remaining three aircraft, and in a short time two more Venturas went down in flames. Heedless of the murderous attacks and of the heavy anti-aircraft fire which was now encountered, Squadron Leader Trent completed an accurate bombing run, and even shot down a Messerschmitt at point blank range. Dropping his bombs in the target area he turned away. The aircraft following him was shot down on reaching the target. Immediately afterwards his own aircraft was hit and went into a spin and broke up. Squadron Leader Trent and his navigator were thrown clear and became prisoners of war. The two other members of the crew perished. On this, his twenty-fourth sortie, Squadron Leader Trent showed outstanding leadership.

An [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV squadron]], much of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=210\u2013217}} Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=83\u201384}} The squadron was to operate [[Lockheed Ventura]]s; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crews were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at [[Eindhoven]]. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=288}}\n\nOn 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on a power station in [[Amsterdam]]. The mission was intended to be as a diversion to another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at [[Ijmuiden]]. \"Ramrod\" was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfires]]. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences.{{sfn|Thompson|1956|pp=143\u2013147}}{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|pp=288\u2013290}} \n[[Image:487 Squadron RNZAF NCOs RAF Methold early 1943.JPG|thumb|right|Non-commissioned officers of Trent's No. 487 Squadron, with a Ventura at RAF Methwold, early 1943]]\nOne Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Me 109s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Me 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Me 109 with the forward [[machine gun]]s of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his [[navigator]] were thrown clear at {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=off}} and became [[prisoners of war]] (POW).

This operation was intended to encourage the Dutch workmen in their resistance to enemy pressure and the target was known to be heavily defended. The importance of bombing it, regardless of enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire, was strongly impressed on the aircrews taking part in the operation. Before taking off Squadron Leader Trent told the deputy leader that he was going over the target whatever happened. All went well until the eleven Venturas and their fighter escort were nearing the Dutch Coast. Then one bomber was hit and had to turn back. Suddenly large numbers of enemy fighters appeared. Our escorting fighters were hotly engaged and lost touch with the bombing force. The Venturas closed up for mutual protection and commenced their run up to the target. Unfortunately the fighters detailed to support them over the target had reached the area too early and had been recalled. Soon the bombers were attacked. They were at the mercy of fifteen to twenty Messerschmitts which dived on them incessantly. Within four minutes six Venturas were destroyed. Squadron Leader Trent continued on his course with the remaining three aircraft, and in a short time two more Venturas went down in flames. Heedless of the murderous attacks and of the heavy anti-aircraft fire which was now encountered, Squadron Leader Trent completed an accurate bombing run, and even shot down a Messerschmitt at point blank range. Dropping his bombs in the target area he turned away. The aircraft following him was shot down on reaching the target. Immediately afterwards his own aircraft was hit and went into a spin and broke up. Squadron Leader Trent and his navigator were thrown clear and became prisoners of war. The two other members of the crew perished. On this, his twenty-fourth sortie, Squadron Leader Trent showed outstanding leadership. Such was the trust placed in this gallant officer that the other pilots followed him unwaveringly.
