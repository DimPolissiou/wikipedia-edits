He was [[Canada]]'s [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] from 2003 to 2006, and leader of the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]] from 1981 to 1988. He was the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Regina-Wascana]] from 1993 to 2019 (the riding was known as simply [[Wascana]] from 1997 to 2015), having previously served as the member for [[Assiniboia (electoral district)|Assiniboia]] from 1974 to 1979. He was named Opposition [[House Leader]] by interim Liberal leader [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]] in 2006, and continued to serve in this role under the leadership of [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]] until September 2010 when he was promoted to [[Deputy Leader]]\u2014a post he retained under Trudeau.\n\n==Early life==\nGoodale was born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] and raised on a farm near [[Wilcox, Saskatchewan]], the son of Winnifred Claire (Myers) and Thomas Henry Goodale.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=yHQnAQAAMAAJ&q=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&dq=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-4rA67zlAhULWN8KHe7MAL8Q6AEwAXoECAkQAQ]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=X4cOAQAAMAAJ&q=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&dq=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-4rA67zlAhULWN8KHe7MAL8Q6AEwAHoECAQQAQ]</ref> He was a member of [[Scouts Canada]] and earned the rank of Queen's Scout.<ref>[http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/MediaCentre/AnnualGeneralMeeting2009/tabid/1748/Default.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128082926/http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/MediaCentre/AnnualGeneralMeeting2009/tabid/1748/Default.aspx |date=November 28, 2009 }}</ref> He first attended the [[University of Regina|University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus]] and then obtained a law degree from the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], where he was awarded the Gold Medal for academic achievement.\n\n==Federal politics, 1974\u20131979==\nActive at politics from a young age, he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|Parliament of Canada]] in the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 election]] at the age of 24 from the seat of [[Assiniboia (electoral district)|Assiniboia]]. He served as a government backbencher until the [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979 election]], when he was defeated.\n\n==Provincial politics==\nIn 1981, Goodale was named leader of the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]].\n\nHe led that party to a very poor showing in the [[1982 Saskatchewan general election|1982 provincial election]], in which the party received 4.51% of the popular vote and won no seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan|provincial legislature]]. However, Goodale was the only Liberal candidate to receive more than 1,000 votes.<ref>[http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/2-13.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101157/http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/2-13.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe party won 9.99% of the vote in the [[1986 Saskatchewan general election|1986 provincial election]], but only Goodale was elected to the legislature. Goodale ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility in this election, arguing that both the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] (NDP) parties favoured excessive spending policies, typified by their proposals for a Keynesian-style stimulation of the provincial economy through subsidized home improvement and renovation schemes.\n\n==Return to federal politics==\n\n===Defeated in 1988 election===\nGoodale resigned as leader to run for the federal Liberals in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 election]] for the seat of [[Regina\u2014Wascana]], but he was narrowly defeated by former Regina mayor [[Larry Schneider (politician)|Larry Schneider]], who later went on to serve briefly in [[Kim Campbell]]'s cabinet. Beginning earlier that year and prior to his resignation, Goodale's executive assistant was [[Jason Kenney]]. Kenney would become a [[Conservative Party of Canada]] MP in a [[Calgary]] riding and later Premier of Alberta.\n\nGoodale then spent five years in the private sector, working for companies such as the Pioneer Life Assurance Company, Pioneer Lifeco Inc., and Sovereign Life Insurance Co.; he has stated in interviews that he felt his political career had ended.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===In government, 1993-2006===\n[[File:Ralph Goodale free alternative.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Goodale in 2004.]]\nGoodale contested Regina-Wascana again in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]] and was elected as part of the Liberal landslide that year.

He was [[Canada]]'s [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] from 2003 to 2006, and leader of the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]] from 1981 to 1988. He was the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Regina-Wascana]] from 1993 to 2019 (the riding was known as simply [[Wascana]] from 1997 to 2015), having previously served as the member for [[Assiniboia (electoral district)|Assiniboia]] from 1974 to 1979. He was named Opposition [[House Leader]] by interim Liberal leader [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]] in 2006, and continued to serve in this role under the leadership of [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]] until September 2010 when he was promoted to [[Deputy Leader]]\u2014a post he retained under Trudeau. \n==Early life==\nGoodale was born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] and raised on a farm near [[Wilcox, Saskatchewan]], the son of Winnifred Claire (Myers) and Thomas Henry Goodale.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=yHQnAQAAMAAJ&q=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&dq=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-4rA67zlAhULWN8KHe7MAL8Q6AEwAXoECAkQAQ]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=X4cOAQAAMAAJ&q=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&dq=Thomas+Henry+Goodale+and+Winnifred+Claire+Goodale&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6-4rA67zlAhULWN8KHe7MAL8Q6AEwAHoECAQQAQ]</ref> He was a member of [[Scouts Canada]] and earned the rank of Queen's Scout.<ref>[http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/MediaCentre/AnnualGeneralMeeting2009/tabid/1748/Default.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128082926/http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/MediaCentre/AnnualGeneralMeeting2009/tabid/1748/Default.aspx |date=November 28, 2009 }}</ref> He first attended the [[University of Regina|University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus]] and then obtained a law degree from the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], where he was awarded the Gold Medal for academic achievement.\n\n==Federal politics, 1974\u20131979==\nActive at politics from a young age, he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|Parliament of Canada]] in the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 election]] at the age of 24 from the seat of [[Assiniboia (electoral district)|Assiniboia]]. He served as a government backbencher until the [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979 election]], when he was defeated.\n\n==Provincial politics==\nIn 1981, Goodale was named leader of the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]].\n\nHe led that party to a very poor showing in the [[1982 Saskatchewan general election|1982 provincial election]], in which the party received 4.51% of the popular vote and won no seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan|provincial legislature]]. However, Goodale was the only Liberal candidate to receive more than 1,000 votes.<ref>[http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/2-13.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101157/http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/2-13.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe party won 9.99% of the vote in the [[1986 Saskatchewan general election|1986 provincial election]], but only Goodale was elected to the legislature. Goodale ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility in this election, arguing that both the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] (NDP) parties favoured excessive spending policies, typified by their proposals for a Keynesian-style stimulation of the provincial economy through subsidized home improvement and renovation schemes.\n\n==Return to federal politics==\n\n===Defeated in 1988 election===\nGoodale resigned as leader to run for the federal Liberals in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 election]] for the seat of [[Regina\u2014Wascana]], but he was narrowly defeated by former Regina mayor [[Larry Schneider (politician)|Larry Schneider]], who later went on to serve briefly in [[Kim Campbell]]'s cabinet. Beginning earlier that year and prior to his resignation, Goodale's executive assistant was [[Jason Kenney]]. Kenney would become a [[Conservative Party of Canada]] MP in a [[Calgary]] riding and later Premier of Alberta.\n\nGoodale then spent five years in the private sector, working for companies such as the Pioneer Life Assurance Company, Pioneer Lifeco Inc., and Sovereign Life Insurance Co.; he has stated in interviews that he felt his political career had ended.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===In government, 1993-2006===\n[[File:Ralph Goodale free alternative.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Goodale in 2004.]]\nGoodale contested Regina-Wascana again in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]] and was elected as part of the Liberal landslide that year.

In bacteria, only the former pathway is present, and mutations that block this pathway are lethal, demonstrating the importance of PA. In mammalian and yeast cells, where the enzymes in these pathways are redundant, mutation of any one enzyme is not lethal. However, it is worth noting that ''in vitro'', the various acyltransferases exhibit different substrate specificities with respect to the acyl-CoAs that are incorporated into PA. Different acyltransferases also have different intracellular distributions, such as the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), the [[mitochondria]] or peroxisomes, and local concentrations of activated fatty acids. This suggests that the various acyltransferases present in mammalian and yeast cells may be responsible for producing different pools of PA.<ref name=\"pmid10542045\"/>\n\nThe conversion of PA into [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG) by LPPs is the commitment step for the production of [[phosphatidylcholine]] (PC), [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PE) and [[phosphatidylserine]] (PS). In addition, DAG is also converted into CDP-DAG, which is a precursor for [[phosphatidylglycerol]] (PG), [[phosphatidylinositol]] (PI) and [[phosphoinositide]]s (PIP, PIP<sub>2</sub>, PIP<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=\"pmid10542045\"/>\n\nPA concentrations are maintained at extremely low levels in the cell by the activity of potent LPPs.<ref name=\"pmid8681429\"/> These convert PA into DAG very rapidly and, because DAG is the precursor for so many other lipids, it too is soon metabolised into other membrane lipids. This means that any upregulation in PA production can be matched, over time, with a corresponding upregulation in LPPs and in DAG metabolising enzymes.\n\nPA is, therefore, essential for lipid synthesis and cell survival, yet, under normal conditions, is maintained at very low levels in the cell.\n\n==Biophysical properties of PA==\nPA is a unique phospholipid in that it has a small highly charged head group that is very close to the glycerol backbone.

A major event in the budding of vesicles, such as transport carriers from the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], is the creation and subsequent narrowing of the membrane neck. Studies have suggested that this process may be lipid-driven, and have postulated a central role for DAG due to its, likewise, unique molecular shape. The presence of two acyl chains but no headgroup results in a large negative curvature in membranes.<ref name=\"pmid14645071\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shemesh T, Luini A, Malhotra V, Burger KN, Kozlov MM |title=Prefission Constriction of Golgi Tubular Carriers Driven by Local Lipid Metabolism: A Theoretical Model |journal=Biophys.

This can result in a more negative membrane curvature. Researchers from [[Utrecht University]] have looked at the effect of lysoPA versus PA on membrane curvature by measuring the effect these have on the transition temperature of PE from lipid bilayers to nonlamellar phases using <sup>31</sup>P-NMR.<ref name=\"pmid12656989\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kooijman EE, Chupin V, de Kruijff B, Burger KN |title=Modulation of membrane curvature by phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid |journal=Traffic |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=162\u201374 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12656989 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0854.2003.00086.x }}</ref> The curvature induced by these lipids was shown to be dependent not only on the structure of lysoPA versus PA but also on dynamic properties, such as the hydration of head groups and inter- and intramolecular interactions. For instance, Ca<sup>2+</sup> may interact with two PAs to form a neutral but highly curved complex. The neutralisation of the otherwise repulsive charges of the headgroups and the absence of any [[steric hindrance]] enables strong intermolecular interactions between the acyl chains, resulting in PA-rich microdomains. Thus ''in vitro'', physiological changes in pH, temperature, and cation concentrations have strong effects on the membrane curvature induced by PA and lysoPA.<ref name=\"pmid12656989\"/> \nThe interconversion of lysoPA, PA, and DAG - and changes in pH and cation concentration - can cause membrane bending and destabilisation, playing a direct role in membrane fission simply by virtue of their biophysical properties. However, though PA and lysoPA have been shown to affect membrane curvature ''in vitro''; their role ''in vivo'' is unclear.\n\nThe roles of lysoPA, PA, and DAG in promoting membrane curvature do not preclude a role in recruiting proteins to the membrane. For instance, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement for the fusion of complex liposomes is not greatly affected by the addition of annexin I, though it is reduced by PLD. However, with annexin I ''and'' PLD, the extent of fusion is greatly enhanced, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement is reduced almost 1000-fold to near physiological levels.<ref name=\"pmid9142853\"/>\n\nThus the metabolic, biophysical, recruitment, and signaling roles of PA may be interrelated.\n\n==Measurement of PA production==\nAs PA is rapidly converted to DAG, it is very short-lived in the cell. This means that it is difficult to measure PA production and therefore to study the role of PA in the cell.

Perhaps the different acyl chains can affect the angle of the head-group in the membrane. If this is the case, it suggests that a PA-binding domain must not only be able to bind PA specifically but must also be able to identify those head-groups that are at the correct angle.

LPAAT activity doubles the number of acyl chains, greatly increasing the cross-sectional area of the lipid that lies \u2018within\u2019 the membrane while the surface headgroup remains unchanged. This can result in a more negative membrane curvature. Researchers from [[Utrecht University]] have looked at the effect of lysoPA versus PA on membrane curvature by measuring the effect these have on the transition temperature of PE from lipid bilayers to nonlamellar phases using <sup>31</sup>P-NMR.<ref name=\"pmid12656989\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kooijman EE, Chupin V, de Kruijff B, Burger KN |title=Modulation of membrane curvature by phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid |journal=Traffic |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=162\u201374 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12656989 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0854.2003.00086.x }}</ref> The curvature induced by these lipids was shown to be dependent not only on the structure of lysoPA versus PA but also on dynamic properties, such as the hydration of head groups and inter- and intramolecular interactions. For instance, Ca<sup>2+</sup> may interact with two PAs to form a neutral but highly curved complex. The neutralisation of the otherwise repulsive charges of the headgroups and the absence of any [[steric hindrance]] enables strong intermolecular interactions between the acyl chains, resulting in PA-rich microdomains. Thus ''in vitro'', physiological changes in pH, temperature, and cation concentrations have strong effects on the membrane curvature induced by PA and lysoPA.<ref name=\"pmid12656989\"/> \nThe interconversion of lysoPA, PA, and DAG - and changes in pH and cation concentration - can cause membrane bending and destabilisation, playing a direct role in membrane fission simply by virtue of their biophysical properties. However, though PA and lysoPA have been shown to affect membrane curvature ''in vitro''; their role ''in vivo'' is unclear.\n\nThe roles of lysoPA, PA, and DAG in promoting membrane curvature do not preclude a role in recruiting proteins to the membrane. For instance, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement for the fusion of complex liposomes is not greatly affected by the addition of annexin I, though it is reduced by PLD. However, with annexin I ''and'' PLD, the extent of fusion is greatly enhanced, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement is reduced almost 1000-fold to near physiological levels.<ref name=\"pmid9142853\"/>\n\nThus the metabolic, biophysical, recruitment, and signaling roles of PA may be interrelated.\n\n==Measurement of PA production==\nAs PA is rapidly converted to DAG, it is very short-lived in the cell. This means that it is difficult to measure PA production and therefore to study the role of PA in the cell. However, PLD activity can be measured by the addition of primary alcohols to the cell.<ref name=\"pmid9324933\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris AJ, Frohman MA, Engebrecht J |title=Measurement of phospholipase D activity |journal=Anal.

The relatively weak binding combined with a low concentration of PA in the membrane allows the channel to turn off. The local high concentration for activation suggests at least some restrictions in local lipid diffusion.

Studies have suggested that DAG signaling is mediated by polyunsaturated DAG, whereas PLD-derived PA is monounsaturated or saturated.

Although some lipid-binding proteins are able to insert themselves into membranes and could hypothetically recognize the type of acyl chain or the resulting properties of the membrane, many lipid-binding proteins are cytosolic and localize to the membrane by binding only the headgroups of lipids. Perhaps the different acyl chains can affect the angle of the head-group in the membrane. If this is the case, it suggests that a PA-binding domain must not only be able to bind PA specifically but must also be able to identify those head-groups that are at the correct angle.
