In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.<ref>Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Byzantine era===\n{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}\n[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>]]\n\nAlthough [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c.&nbsp;312 AD), scattered expressions of [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use of images]] were reported (e.g. the Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]).

She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772\u2013795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:\n\n{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.\n\n ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.<ref name=\"Tanner, Norman P. p. 132\u2013136\">Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J.

To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:\n# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The \"Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum\" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:<ref name=\"hieria1\"/>\n\n{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, ''charakt\u0113r'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}\n\n#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype\u2014of the same substance\u2014which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) \"icon\" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.\n#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).\n#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice.\n\n<blockquote>Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.<ref name=\"hieria1\">{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.\n[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]\nThe chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, \"but rather the creator of matter\".  However he also declared, \"But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace\". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.\n\nThe iconodule response to iconoclasm included:\n#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.\n#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was \"all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated\". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.\n#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18\u201322|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.\n#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''par\u00e1dosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).\n#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.\n#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.\n -->\n\n===Reformation era===\n{{further|Beeldenstorm|Iconophobia#Iconophobia and the English Reformation}}\nThe first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]]. It prompted [[Martin Luther]], then concealing as ''Junker J\u00f6rg'', to intervene.

It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. \"An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments\" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: \"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}</ref><ref name=\"Felix2015\"/> the [[Reformed]] (Calvinist) leaders, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God.<ref name=\"Felix2015\">{{cite book|last=Felix|first=Steven|title=Pentecostal Aesthetics: Theological Reflections in a Pentecostal Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics.|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English|isbn=9789004291621|page=22|quote=Luther's view was that biblical images could be used as teaching aids, and thus had didactic value.

This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of \"iconoclasm\" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.\n\nAmong Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.\n\n===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===\n<!-- this should be broken out into a separate article -->\nThroughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nDuring the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed.

Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.<ref>Bette W. Oliver.

Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to \"avoid favoritism among artists,\" the paintings were \"secretly held in high regard.\"<ref>Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223</ref> Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.<ref>Emmet 1989, p. 225</ref> These artistic symbols of \"royalty, feudalism, and superstition\" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.<ref>Stanley J. Idzerda, \"Iconoclasm during the French Revolution.\" In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.</ref> The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.<ref>Foucault, Michel. \"Of Other Spaces.\" Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.</ref> Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.<ref>Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari.

It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.<ref>Greene, Christopher M., \"Alexandre Lenoir and the Mus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais during the French Revolution,\" French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200\u2013222.</ref> \"Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones.\" <ref>Greene 1981, p. 207.</ref>\n-->\n\n===Destruction of Hindu temples===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Iconoclasm during the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]]\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"210\">\nSomnath temple ruins (1869).jpg|The [[Somnath Temple]] in Gujarat was repeatedly destroyed by Islamic armies and rebuilt by Hindus.

A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.\n\nIn 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building.

Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand.

Within [[Christianity]], iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a strict interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the production and worship of \"[[Idolatry|graven images]] or any likeness of anything\".<ref>\"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or anything that is in the earth beneath, or anything that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&nbsp;...\" (Exodus 20:4\u20135a, ESV.)</ref> The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], who were fundamentally iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially \"Jewish in spirit\".<ref name=RobertM1>{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28\u201330|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy#v=onepage&q=heretic&f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> Degrees of iconoclasm vary greatly among religions and their branches.

He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublic references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.\n\nComparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:\n\n<blockquote>For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.<ref>Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Byzantine era===\n{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}\n[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>]]\n\nAlthough [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c.&nbsp;312 AD), scattered expressions of [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use of images]] were reported (e.g. the Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527\u2013565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.\n\nOne notable change within the [[Byzantine Empire]] came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins.

She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772\u2013795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:\n\n{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.\n\n ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.<ref name=\"Tanner, Norman P. p. 132\u2013136\">Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J.

To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:\n# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The \"Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum\" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:<ref name=\"hieria1\"/>\n\n{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&nbsp;...

Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) \"icon\" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.\n#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).\n#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice.\n\n<blockquote>Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&nbsp;...

John declared that he did not venerate matter, \"but rather the creator of matter\".  However he also declared, \"But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace\". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.\n\nThe iconodule response to iconoclasm included:\n#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.\n#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was \"all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated\". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.\n#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18\u201322|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.\n#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''par\u00e1dosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).\n#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.\n#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.\n -->\n\n===Reformation era===\n{{further|Beeldenstorm|Iconophobia#Iconophobia and the English Reformation}}\nThe first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]].

It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. \"An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments\" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: \"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different.

Stricter definitions of \"iconoclasm\" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.\n\nAmong Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.\n\n===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===\n<!-- this should be broken out into a separate article -->\nThroughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].

Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.<ref>Bette W. Oliver.

Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.<ref>Foucault, Michel. \"Of Other Spaces.\" Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.</ref> Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.<ref>Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari.

The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, \"In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground.

It is located at the confluence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|River Timi\u0219]] with the [[Sebe\u0219 River (Timi\u0219)|River Sebe\u0219]], the latter coming from the [[\u021aarcu Mountains]]. To the west, it is in direct contact with the Banat Hills. It is an important railroad node, being located approximately 40&nbsp;km away from [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], 21&nbsp;km from [[O\u021belu Ro\u0219u]], 70&nbsp;km from [[Ha\u021beg]] and about 25&nbsp;km from the Muntele Mic ski resort, in the [[\u021aarcu Mountains]].\n\nOne village, Jupa ({{lang-hu|Zsuppa}}), is administered by the city.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Caransebe\u0219 is rather mild. Sub-Mediterranean climatic influences are present to some extent. Temperatures do not drop too low in winter (with an average of 0,-15&nbsp;\u00b0C), but summers can be warm (30-38&nbsp;\u00b0C average). [[Rainfall]] can be quite abundant throughout the year.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Banat Josephinische Landaufnahme pg121.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Jupa village on the cadastral maps of [[Banat]] region, Josephinische Landesaufnahme, 1769-72]]\nThe first traces of habitation here might date as far as [[Dacia]]n times. Dacian ruins have been discovered recently near [[Obreja]], a village 7&nbsp;km away. As the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] invaded [[Dacia]], they built a [[castrum]] named [[Tibiscum]], which was dug up by archaeologists near the nearby village of Jupa, a castrum which later grew to be a full city. Tibiscum is considered one of the gates of [[Christianity]] in [[Dacia]], having an important role also in the [[Roman culture|Romanization]] of the local people.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the local people continuously inhabited the area. The region became part of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]], then later under the rule of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Transylvanian Principality]], and under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1787 a self-inflicted defeat, the [[Battle of Kar\u00e1nsebes|Battle of Caransebe\u0219]], is supposed (the historical accuracy is in doubt) to have taken place here. Later, the [[Habsburgs]] took the control of the region, after prolonged wars against the Ottomans. As part of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Principality of Transylvania]], in 1804 it became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], it became again part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].\n\nAfter railroads began to appear, the role of Caransebe\u0219 grew continuously. In the late 19th century, the Romanian people of the settlement elected to the Parliament of Hungary the Hungarian Lajos Mocs\u00e1ry, who was a progressive democratic politician fighting for the cultural and administrative rights of all nationalities (including the Romanians) living in the Hungarian Kingdom of that time.

It is located at the confluence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|River Timi\u0219]] with the [[Sebe\u0219 River (Timi\u0219)|River Sebe\u0219]], the latter coming from the [[\u021aarcu Mountains]]. To the west, it is in direct contact with the Banat Hills. It is an important railroad node, being located approximately 40&nbsp;km away from [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], 21&nbsp;km from [[O\u021belu Ro\u0219u]], 70&nbsp;km from [[Ha\u021beg]] and about 25&nbsp;km from the Muntele Mic ski resort, in the [[\u021aarcu Mountains]].\n\nOne village, Jupa ({{lang-hu|Zsuppa}}), is administered by the city.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Caransebe\u0219 is rather mild. Sub-Mediterranean climatic influences are present to some extent. Temperatures do not drop too low in winter (with an average of 0,-15&nbsp;\u00b0C), but summers can be warm (30-38&nbsp;\u00b0C average). [[Rainfall]] can be quite abundant throughout the year.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Banat Josephinische Landaufnahme pg121.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Jupa village on the cadastral maps of [[Banat]] region, Josephinische Landesaufnahme, 1769-72]]\nThe first traces of habitation here might date as far as [[Dacia]]n times. Dacian ruins have been discovered recently near [[Obreja]], a village 7&nbsp;km away. As the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] invaded [[Dacia]], they built a [[castrum]] named [[Tibiscum]], which was dug up by archaeologists near the nearby village of Jupa, a castrum which later grew to be a full city. Tibiscum is considered one of the gates of [[Christianity]] in [[Dacia]], having an important role also in the [[Roman culture|Romanization]] of the local people.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the local people continuously inhabited the area. The region became part of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]], then later under the rule of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Transylvanian Principality]], and under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1787 a self-inflicted defeat, the [[Battle of Kar\u00e1nsebes|Battle of Caransebe\u0219]], is supposed (the historical accuracy is in doubt) to have taken place here. Later, the [[Habsburgs]] took the control of the region, after prolonged wars against the Ottomans. As part of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Principality of Transylvania]], in 1804 it became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], it became again part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].\n\nAfter railroads began to appear, the role of Caransebe\u0219 grew continuously. In the late 19th century, the Romanian people of the settlement elected to the Parliament of Hungary the Hungarian Lajos Mocs\u00e1ry, who was a progressive democratic politician fighting for the cultural and administrative rights of all nationalities (including the Romanians) living in the Hungarian Kingdom of that time. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]], in 1920 Caransebe\u0219 became part of [[Greater Romania]]. After the rise of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] in 1947, an [[Caransebe\u0219 Airport|airport]] and an airbase were built close to the city. However, the airport did not remain operational for long after the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |7999\n|1930 |8704\n|1948 |10106\n|1956 |15195\n|1966 |18194\n|1977 |27190\n|1992 |31985\n|2002 |31199\n|2011 |21932\n}}\n\nAs of 2011 Caransebe\u0219 had a population of 21,932, mainly [[Romanians]] (93.48%), with [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] (1.56%), [[Germans|German]] (1.17%) and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] (0.78%) minorities present, but in decline.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Nicolae Corneanu]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[metropolitan bishop]]\n* [[Corneliu Dragalina]], Romanian [[World War II]] General\n* [[Ion Dragalina]], Romanian [[World War I]] General\n* [[Ren\u00e9 F\u00fcl\u00f6p-Miller]], Austrian cultural historian and writer\n* [[Sorin Grindeanu]], politician, Prime Minister of Romania\n* [[Emanoil Ionescu]], Romanian World War II General\n* [[Gustav Jaumann]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian]] [[physicist]] (1863\u20131924)\n* [[Wilhelm Klein]], archaeologist\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Caransebe\u0219}}\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://primaria-caransebes.ro Official Website of the Caransebe\u0219 City Hall]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080115080254/http://www.caransebes.ro/ Unofficial website about Caransebe\u0219]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131207090315/http://www.banaterra.eu/romana/toponimii/c/caransebes/index.htm Banaterra - Information about the Caransebe\u0219 Region]\n\n{{Cara\u0219-Severin County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caransebes}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Cara\u0219-Severin County]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Localities in Romanian Banat]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caransebe%C8%99"}
