Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M48's 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor.

To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nIn the mid-1970s, the vehicle was modified to carry the heavier 105&nbsp;mm gun. The original program designation was XM736. The designation was subsequently changed to M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5. As many components from the [[M60 Patton|M60A1]] were utilized as possible. [[Anniston Army Depot]] was issued a contract to convert 501 M48A3 tanks to the M48A5 standard and this was completed in December 1976. These early M48A5's were essentially M48A3 tanks with the 105mm gun added. They retained the M1 cupola armed with a .50 cal machine gun.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.\n\n==Combat service==\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Vietnam....Marines riding atop an M-48 tank cover their ears as te 90mm gun fires during a road sweep southwest of... - NARA - 532483.tif|thumb|US Marines riding atop an M48 tank in Vietnam in April 1968.]]\nThe M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role. However, there were few actual tank versus tank battles. One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment at [[Ben Het Camp]] in March 1969.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971.

However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor.

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M48's 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nIn the mid-1970s, the vehicle was modified to carry the heavier 105&nbsp;mm gun. The original program designation was XM736. The designation was subsequently changed to M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5. As many components from the [[M60 Patton|M60A1]] were utilized as possible. [[Anniston Army Depot]] was issued a contract to convert 501 M48A3 tanks to the M48A5 standard and this was completed in December 1976. These early M48A5's were essentially M48A3 tanks with the 105mm gun added. They retained the M1 cupola armed with a .50 cal machine gun.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.\n\n==Combat service==\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Vietnam....Marines riding atop an M-48 tank cover their ears as te 90mm gun fires during a road sweep southwest of... - NARA - 532483.tif|thumb|US Marines riding atop an M48 tank in Vietnam in April 1968.]]\nThe M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War. Over 600 Pattons would be deployed with US forces during that war.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}{{r|1979_Starry}} The initial M48s first landed with the US Marine 1st and 3rd Tank Battalions in 1965,{{r|1982_Dunstan}} with the 5th Marine Tank Battalion later becoming a back-up/reinforcement unit.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role. However, there were few actual tank versus tank battles. One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment at [[Ben Het Camp]] in March 1969.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a [[catastrophic kill]].{{r|1979_Starry}}\n\nSupply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:\n\n* 1971: 54.{{r|2015_Hatcher}}\n* May 1972: 120.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* October 1972: 72.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* November 1972: 59.{{r|1979_Starry|page=218}}\n* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.<ref>Better Management of Secondary Items by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Would Reduce U.S. Investment; Department of Defense: Report to the Congress by the Comptroller General of the United States.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971.

However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105&nbsp;mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] round designed to defeat the Soviet [[T-62|T-62 tank]], which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the [[M60 Patton]].

About 150 of M48s were lost in this tank battle alone.{{r|2011_Farrokh|page=362}}\n\n===Africa===\nIn 1973, Morocco took delivery of its first M48A3s. By the end of the 1970s, further deliveries of M48A5 had occurred and the upgrade to M48A5 was achieved locally with the aid of US consultants. In 1987, a final shipment of 100 M48A5 tanks from the Wisconsin National Guard was delivered to the Moroccan army. There are unconfirmed reports of deliveries of Israeli M48A5s during the 1980s.

He was born in Changzhou County (\u9577\u6d32\u7e23, not [[Changzhou]]), now part of [[Suzhou]], in [[Jiangsu]] Province.<ref>Yenna Wu. ''Vernacular Stories.''  in [[V. Mair]], (ed.),  ''[[The Columbia History of Chinese Literature]]''  (NY: [[Columbia University Press]],  2001). pp. 597-605.</ref>\n\nFeng was born into a scholar-bureaucrat gentry household, where he and his brothers Feng Menggui (\u99ae\u5922\u6842) and Feng Mengxiong (\u99ae\u5922\u718a) were educated in the classics and the traditional arts of the gentleman. He and his brothers, all well-known as accomplished writers, artists, and poets, became known collectively as the \"Three Fengs of the Wu Area\" (\u5433\u4e0b\u4e09\u99ae).  In spite of his literary talent and his zeal for scholarship from a young age, Feng sat the imperial civil service examinations many times without success, eventually giving up and making a living as a tutor and teacher.   \n\nIn 1626, he narrowly avoided punishment after being implicated as an associate of Zhou Shunchang (\u5468\u9806\u660c), who was framed and purged by the corrupt eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]].  Appalled by the injustice, he resolved to complete his trilogy of vernacular Chinese short story collections: ''Stories to Instruct the World'', ''Stories to Caution the World'', and ''Stories to Awaken the World''  (\u55bb\u4e16\u660e\u8a00, \u8b66\u4e16\u901a\u8a00, and \u9192\u4e16\u6046\u8a00). \n\nIn recognition of his reputation as a writer, Feng was finally awarded the ''[[Imperial examination|gongsheng]]'' degree in 1630 at the age of fifty-seven.  In the subsequent year, he received his first government post as instructor of Dantu County (\u4e39\u5f92\u7e23, today [[Zhenjiang]], Jiangsu).  In 1634, he was appointed magistrate of [[Shouning County|Shouning]] County (\u58fd\u5be7) in Fujian.  During his tenure, he became regarded as a morally upright and diligent administrator.  He retired in 1638.\n\nIn 1644, the Ming state was thrown into turmoil by the sacking of Beijing by [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebel army and invasion by the Manchu Qing forces.  At the age of seventy-one, he published the ''Grand Proposals for National Rejuvenation'' (\u4e2d\u8208\u5049\u7565) to inspire his countrymen to repel the invaders.  He died in despair in 1646 as the Ming dynasty continued to collapse.  Some works indicate or imply that he was killed by Qing soldiers.\n\nFeng's literary output consisted of the compilation of histories and local gazettes, the retelling of folktales and stories from antiquity in the form of short stories and plays, and the authorship of vernacular Chinese novels. Two of his noteworthy works are the ''Qing Shi'' (''History of Love'', \u60c5\u53f2), an anthology of classical love stories, and the [[shenmo]] novel ''[[Pingyao Zhuan]]''. In 1620 he published the ''[[Illustrious Words to Instruct the World]]'' (\u55bb\u4e16\u660e\u8a00 Yushi Mingyan), or ''Stories Old and New'', the first part of his well-known trilogy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tnGASn7jJsIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Feng+Menglong&hl=en&ei=Hg9DTsLtC8eHsAKo8_3HCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Stories old and new: a Ming dynasty collection''.]  [[University of Washington Press]]</ref>\n\nFeng was a proponent of the school of [[Li Zhi (Ming Dynasty)|Li Zhi]], which supported the importance of human feelings and behavior in literature. He is frequently associated with [[Ling Mengchu]], author of [[Slapping the Table in Amazement]],<ref>http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/LINSLA.html</ref> a two-part collection of entertaining vernacular tales.\n\n==Writing style==\nFeng Menglong was in love with a famous prostitute when he was young. Unfortunately, Feng Menglong was not able to afford to redeem his lover out. At the end, his lover was redeemed by a merchant, and they had to leave each other. Feng Menglong suffered from pain and desperation due to the separation, and he expressed his sorrow through poems. This experience influenced the way he portrayed female characters in his stories. In fact, Feng Menglong was one of the few authors who portrayed female as being strong and intelligent; and this is different from other authors, where they tended to ignore the importance of female\u2019s position. The female characters in Feng Menglong\u2019s stories were portrayed as brave and bright when dealing with different situations. For instance, in his story Wan Xiuniang Takes Revenge Through Toy Pavilions from Jing Shi Tong Yan, Wan Xiuniang showed her braveness during her tough times, and she was able to escape using her intelligence. Other female characters, such as Du Shi-niang and Qu Xiuxiu, are example to show Feng Menglong\u2019s respectful and sympathetic portrayal of female characters.\n\nFeng Menglong also expressed his attitudes towards society through his works, which were heavily influenced by his interactions with officialdom and the Chinese literati. Feng Menglong became the magistrate of Shouning near the end of his life, in his sixties. During his appointment, he sought to correct injustices and hoped to build up a reputation as an humble and upright official. Unfortunately, his efforts were frustrated by the widespread corruption of the late Ming dynasty (a theme also treated extensively in other contemporaneous works, such as Zhang Yingyu's ''[[The Book of Swindles]]'' (ca. 1617)<ref>Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017).</ref>); bribery and extortion were common bureaucratic behaviors, and themes of official malfeasance figure in many of Feng's stories. Realizing that atmosphere of corruption could not be easily changed, Feng Menglong conveyed his discontent and patriotism through words. Each character of his stories has strong and direct characteristics: there is a clear morality line drawn between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. Moreover, the meaning behind the stories explores the social issues during Ming Dynasty. For instance, the stories of \"The White Maiden Locked for Eternity in [[Leifeng Pagoda]]\" and \"The Young Lady Gives the Young Man a Gift of Money\" from ''Stories to Caution the World'' express the idea of how women pursued their freedom and happiness under a patriarchal society.\n\nDuring his tenure as magistrate of Shouning, Feng learned of the local practice of [[Female infanticide in China|drowning female infants]] in the river.  He authored the ''Public Notice on the Prohibition of the Drowning of Daughters'' (\u7981\u6eba\u5973\u544a\u793a) to appeal to parents not to carry out what he viewed as an abhorrent custom and provide for punishments for infanticidal parents and rewards for those taking in abandoned children.<ref>An excerpt:\n \n\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u4e00\u822c\u5341\u6708\u61f7\u80ce\uff0c\u5403\u76e1\u8f9b\u82e6\uff0c\u4e0d\u8ad6\u7537\u5973\uff0c\u7e3d\u662f\u9aa8\u8840\uff0c\u4f55\u5fcd\u6df9\u68c4\u3002 \u70ba\u7236\u8005\u4f60\u81ea\u60f3\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u6536\u5973\uff0c\u4f60\u59bb\u5f9e\u4f55\u800c\u4f86\uff1f\u70ba\u6bcd\u8005\u4f60\u81ea\u60f3\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u6536\u5973\uff0c\u4f60\u8eab\u5f9e\u4f55\u800c\u6d3b\uff1f\u6cc1\u4e14\u751f\u7537\u672a\u5fc5\u5b5d\u9806\uff0c\u751f\u5973\u672a\u5fc5\u5fe4\u9006\u3002\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\n\n...

He was born in Changzhou County (\u9577\u6d32\u7e23, not [[Changzhou]]), now part of [[Suzhou]], in [[Jiangsu]] Province.<ref>Yenna Wu. ''Vernacular Stories.''  in [[V. Mair]], (ed.),  ''[[The Columbia History of Chinese Literature]]''  (NY: [[Columbia University Press]],  2001). pp. 597-605.</ref>\n\nFeng was born into a scholar-bureaucrat gentry household, where he and his brothers Feng Menggui (\u99ae\u5922\u6842) and Feng Mengxiong (\u99ae\u5922\u718a) were educated in the classics and the traditional arts of the gentleman. He and his brothers, all well-known as accomplished writers, artists, and poets, became known collectively as the \"Three Fengs of the Wu Area\" (\u5433\u4e0b\u4e09\u99ae).  In spite of his literary talent and his zeal for scholarship from a young age, Feng sat the imperial civil service examinations many times without success, eventually giving up and making a living as a tutor and teacher.   \n\nIn 1626, he narrowly avoided punishment after being implicated as an associate of Zhou Shunchang (\u5468\u9806\u660c), who was framed and purged by the corrupt eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]].  Appalled by the injustice, he resolved to complete his trilogy of vernacular Chinese short story collections: ''Stories to Instruct the World'', ''Stories to Caution the World'', and ''Stories to Awaken the World''  (\u55bb\u4e16\u660e\u8a00, \u8b66\u4e16\u901a\u8a00, and \u9192\u4e16\u6046\u8a00). \n\nIn recognition of his reputation as a writer, Feng was finally awarded the ''[[Imperial examination|gongsheng]]'' degree in 1630 at the age of fifty-seven.  In the subsequent year, he received his first government post as instructor of Dantu County (\u4e39\u5f92\u7e23, today [[Zhenjiang]], Jiangsu).  In 1634, he was appointed magistrate of [[Shouning County|Shouning]] County (\u58fd\u5be7) in Fujian.  During his tenure, he became regarded as a morally upright and diligent administrator.  He retired in 1638.\n\nIn 1644, the Ming state was thrown into turmoil by the sacking of Beijing by [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebel army and invasion by the Manchu Qing forces.  At the age of seventy-one, he published the ''Grand Proposals for National Rejuvenation'' (\u4e2d\u8208\u5049\u7565) to inspire his countrymen to repel the invaders.  He died in despair in 1646 as the Ming dynasty continued to collapse.  Some works indicate or imply that he was killed by Qing soldiers.\n\nFeng's literary output consisted of the compilation of histories and local gazettes, the retelling of folktales and stories from antiquity in the form of short stories and plays, and the authorship of vernacular Chinese novels. Two of his noteworthy works are the ''Qing Shi'' (''History of Love'', \u60c5\u53f2), an anthology of classical love stories, and the [[shenmo]] novel ''[[Pingyao Zhuan]]''. In 1620 he published the ''[[Illustrious Words to Instruct the World]]'' (\u55bb\u4e16\u660e\u8a00 Yushi Mingyan), or ''Stories Old and New'', the first part of his well-known trilogy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tnGASn7jJsIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Feng+Menglong&hl=en&ei=Hg9DTsLtC8eHsAKo8_3HCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Stories old and new: a Ming dynasty collection''.]  [[University of Washington Press]]</ref>\n\nFeng was a proponent of the school of [[Li Zhi (Ming Dynasty)|Li Zhi]], which supported the importance of human feelings and behavior in literature. He is frequently associated with [[Ling Mengchu]], author of [[Slapping the Table in Amazement]],<ref>http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/LINSLA.html</ref> a two-part collection of entertaining vernacular tales.\n\n==Writing style==\nFeng Menglong was in love with a famous prostitute when he was young. Unfortunately, Feng Menglong was not able to afford to redeem his lover out. At the end, his lover was redeemed by a merchant, and they had to leave each other. Feng Menglong suffered from pain and desperation due to the separation, and he expressed his sorrow through poems. This experience influenced the way he portrayed female characters in his stories. In fact, Feng Menglong was one of the few authors who portrayed female as being strong and intelligent; and this is different from other authors, where they tended to ignore the importance of female\u2019s position. The female characters in Feng Menglong\u2019s stories were portrayed as brave and bright when dealing with different situations. For instance, in his story Wan Xiuniang Takes Revenge Through Toy Pavilions from Jing Shi Tong Yan, Wan Xiuniang showed her braveness during her tough times, and she was able to escape using her intelligence. Other female characters, such as Du Shi-niang and Qu Xiuxiu, are example to show Feng Menglong\u2019s respectful and sympathetic portrayal of female characters.\n\nFeng Menglong also expressed his attitudes towards society through his works, which were heavily influenced by his interactions with officialdom and the Chinese literati. Feng Menglong became the magistrate of Shouning near the end of his life, in his sixties. During his appointment, he sought to correct injustices and hoped to build up a reputation as an humble and upright official. Unfortunately, his efforts were frustrated by the widespread corruption of the late Ming dynasty (a theme also treated extensively in other contemporaneous works, such as Zhang Yingyu's ''[[The Book of Swindles]]'' (ca. 1617)<ref>Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017).</ref>); bribery and extortion were common bureaucratic behaviors, and themes of official malfeasance figure in many of Feng's stories. Realizing that atmosphere of corruption could not be easily changed, Feng Menglong conveyed his discontent and patriotism through words. Each character of his stories has strong and direct characteristics: there is a clear morality line drawn between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. Moreover, the meaning behind the stories explores the social issues during Ming Dynasty. For instance, the stories of \"The White Maiden Locked for Eternity in [[Leifeng Pagoda]]\" and \"The Young Lady Gives the Young Man a Gift of Money\" from ''Stories to Caution the World'' express the idea of how women pursued their freedom and happiness under a patriarchal society.\n\nDuring his tenure as magistrate of Shouning, Feng learned of the local practice of [[Female infanticide in China|drowning female infants]] in the river.  He authored the ''Public Notice on the Prohibition of the Drowning of Daughters'' (\u7981\u6eba\u5973\u544a\u793a) to appeal to parents not to carry out what he viewed as an abhorrent custom and provide for punishments for infanticidal parents and rewards for those taking in abandoned children.<ref>An excerpt:\n \n\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u4e00\u822c\u5341\u6708\u61f7\u80ce\uff0c\u5403\u76e1\u8f9b\u82e6\uff0c\u4e0d\u8ad6\u7537\u5973\uff0c\u7e3d\u662f\u9aa8\u8840\uff0c\u4f55\u5fcd\u6df9\u68c4\u3002 \u70ba\u7236\u8005\u4f60\u81ea\u60f3\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u6536\u5973\uff0c\u4f60\u59bb\u5f9e\u4f55\u800c\u4f86\uff1f\u70ba\u6bcd\u8005\u4f60\u81ea\u60f3\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u6536\u5973\uff0c\u4f60\u8eab\u5f9e\u4f55\u800c\u6d3b\uff1f\u6cc1\u4e14\u751f\u7537\u672a\u5fc5\u5b5d\u9806\uff0c\u751f\u5973\u672a\u5fc5\u5fe4\u9006\u3002\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\n\n...

In 1834 all but two of the bishops of the Church of England confirmed that they would accept holders of Durham degrees for ordination. In 1835 a fundamental statute was passed by the Dean and Chapter, as governors of the University, setting up [[Convocation]] and laying down that Durham degrees would only be open to members of the Church of England. Regulations for degrees were finalised in 1836 and the university was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] granted by William IV on 1 June 1837 as the \"Warden, Masters and Scholars of the University of Durham\", with the first students graduating a week later.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accommodation was provided in the Archdeacon's Inn (now Cosin's Hall) from 1833 to 1837.

Those attending [[University College, Durham|University College]] were expected to bring a servant with them to deal with cooking, cleaning and so on. The level of applications to Bishop Hatfield's Hall led to a second hall along similar lines, [[Bishop Cosin's Hall]], being founded in 1851, although this only survived until 1864.

criticised for not accepting as many students from low participation neighbourhoods, and from state schools, as might be expected from its admission standards and course offerings. For admissions in 2015/16, Durham had the third lowest percentage of state school students (among higher education institutions with over 1,000 full-time first-degree entrants) at 60.5 per cent, compared to a [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] benchmark of 75 per cent. According to pro-vice-chancellor, Alan Hudson, this was a temporary drop from the 63 per cent level the university has reached in recent years, and to which it was expected to return in 2016/17. The university also fell short of its benchmark for admissions from low participation neighbourhoods, accepting 5.1 per cent, compared to a benchmark of 6 per cent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/data-analysis-latest-hesa-figures-state-school-entrants|work=Times Higher Education|title=Data analysis: latest Hesa figures on state school entrants|date=3 February 2017|author=John Elmes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/durham-university-one-lowest-admission-12554295|work=Chronicle Live|author=Hannah Graham|date=4 February 2017|title=Durham University has one of the lowest admission rates for pupils from state schools}}</ref> The data for 2016/17 showed that admissions from state schools had recovered to 62.9 per cent, still short of the location-adjusted benchmark of 74.9 per cent, and that admissions from low participation neighbourhoods were 5.2 per cent compared to the location-adjusted benchmark of 6.6 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/01-02-2018/widening-participation-tables|title=Widening participation: UK Performance Indicators 2016/17|publisher=Higher Education Statistics Agency|accessdate=1 September 2018|date=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince 1992 the university has run a widening access programme, originally called the Centre for Lifelong Learning and now known as the Durham Centre for Academic Development.

In 1834 all but two of the bishops of the Church of England confirmed that they would accept holders of Durham degrees for ordination. In 1835 a fundamental statute was passed by the Dean and Chapter, as governors of the University, setting up [[Convocation]] and laying down that Durham degrees would only be open to members of the Church of England. Regulations for degrees were finalised in 1836 and the university was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] granted by William IV on 1 June 1837 as the \"Warden, Masters and Scholars of the University of Durham\", with the first students graduating a week later.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accommodation was provided in the Archdeacon's Inn (now Cosin's Hall) from 1833 to 1837.

Those attending [[University College, Durham|University College]] were expected to bring a servant with them to deal with cooking, cleaning and so on. The level of applications to Bishop Hatfield's Hall led to a second hall along similar lines, [[Bishop Cosin's Hall]], being founded in 1851, although this only survived until 1864. Elsewhere, the university expanded from Durham into [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1852 when the medical school there (established in 1834) became a college of the university.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> This was joined in 1871 by the College of Physical Sciences (renamed the College of Science in 1884 and again renamed Armstrong College in 1904). [[St Cuthbert's Society]] was founded in 1888 for non-collegiate, mostly mature, male students as a non-residential society run by the students themselves. Two teacher-training colleges \u2013 St Hild's for women, established in 1858, and The College of the Venerable Bede for men, established in 1839,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> also existed in the city and these merged to form the mixed [[College of St Hild and St Bede]] in 1975.

It opened under the name of University College Stockton (UCS) in 1992.\n\nUCS was initially intended to grant joint degrees validated by both institutions (BAs and BScs). However, Teesside, which had only become a university in 1992, had difficulties in taking on its responsibilities for the college and withdrew in 1994, Durham taking over full responsibility for UCS and the degrees to be awarded there.\n\nA programme of integration with Durham began, with the Privy Council approving changes in Durham's statutes to make UCS a college of the University of Durham. Further integration of the Stockton development with the University led to the formation of the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC) in 1998 and the separation of teaching responsibilities from UCS.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Al-Qasimi Building.jpg|thumb|School of Government and International Affairs]]\nIn 2001, two new colleges, [[John Snow College|John Snow]] and [[Stephenson College, Durham|George Stephenson]] (after the [[John Snow (physician)|physician]] and the [[George Stephenson|engineer]]) were established at Stockton, replacing UCS, and the new [[Durham University School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health|medical school]] (operating in association with the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]]) accepted its first students.

criticised for not accepting as many students from low participation neighbourhoods, and from state schools, as might be expected from its admission standards and course offerings.

According to pro-vice-chancellor, Alan Hudson, this was a temporary drop from the 63 per cent level the university has reached in recent years, and to which it was expected to return in 2016/17. The university also fell short of its benchmark for admissions from low participation neighbourhoods, accepting 5.1 per cent, compared to a benchmark of 6 per cent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/data-analysis-latest-hesa-figures-state-school-entrants|work=Times Higher Education|title=Data analysis: latest Hesa figures on state school entrants|date=3 February 2017|author=John Elmes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/durham-university-one-lowest-admission-12554295|work=Chronicle Live|author=Hannah Graham|date=4 February 2017|title=Durham University has one of the lowest admission rates for pupils from state schools}}</ref> The data for 2016/17 showed that admissions from state schools had recovered to 62.9 per cent, still short of the location-adjusted benchmark of 74.9 per cent, and that admissions from low participation neighbourhoods were 5.2 per cent compared to the location-adjusted benchmark of 6.6 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/01-02-2018/widening-participation-tables|title=Widening participation: UK Performance Indicators 2016/17|publisher=Higher Education Statistics Agency|accessdate=1 September 2018|date=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince 1992 the university has run a widening access programme, originally called the Centre for Lifelong Learning and now known as the Durham Centre for Academic Development.

The album was received well by the music media. Between June and September of 1998 Easy Rider recorded their second album ''Lord of the Storm''. This album was sung entirely in English with its sights set on the international market. Those two albums led them to win in 1999 the \"Best New Band Award\" from the prestigious Spanish music magazine [[:es:Vicente_Romero_\"Mariscal\"|Heavy Rock]]. Their third album, that led them to the peak of their popularity and is considered their best by the fans, ''Evilution'' (with lyrics literally extracted from the [[Book of Revelation]]), was released in 2000 with a great impact among the specialized press in [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalcry.com/discos/easy-rider-evilution/|title=EASY RIDER \u2013 EVILUTION \u2013 Metalcry.com :: Tu Web de Rock y Metal|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rafabasa.com/2000/10/31/easy-rider-evilution-octubre-2000/|title=EASY RIDER \u2013 Evilution \u2013 Octubre 2000 {{!}} WWW.RAFABASA.COM - Noticias en espa\u00f1ol sobre el heavy metal y los grupos de heavy metal.|last=admin|date=2000-10-31|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://easy-rider.es/bio/english.html|title=Easy Rider Official Website\\BIOGRAPHY|website=easy-rider.es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the singer Eugenio Gara\u00f1eda left the band together with the drummer Antonio Chaves.
