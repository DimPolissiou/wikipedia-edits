When the egg is fertilized and becomes a diploid zygote, it then develops into the diploid sporangium. Note that the sporangium is attached to a haploid pseudopodium that was derived from gametophytic tissue. Through the process of meiosis, haploid spores are produced and released through the gaps of the dehisced sporangium.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Conservation ==\nAccording to the [https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/conservation-data-centre BC Conservation Data Centre], this species is deemed \"demonstrably widespread, abundant and secure\" globally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/conservation-data-centre/explore-cdc-data/status-ranks|title=Conservation Status Ranks|last=|first=|date=|website=British Columbia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> In British Columbia, it is labelled as \"at the least risk of being lost\".<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/eswp/speciesSummary.do?id=18683|title=Species Summary of A. rupestris|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/conservation-data-centre/explore-cdc-data/red-blue-yellow-lists|title=Red, Blue & Yellow Lists|last=|first=|date=|website=British Columbia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><br />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Andreaeaceae]]\n[[Category:Mosses]]\n", "name_user": "Elysia (Wiki Ed)", "label": "safe", "comment": "formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreaea_rupestris"}
