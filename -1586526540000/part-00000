It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 11, 2007. It was written by [[Daniel Chun]], and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]]. [[Jane Kaczmarek]] guest starred as her recurring character, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Judge Constance Harm|Judge Constance Harm]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] surprises the family with a newly decorated basement, now a [[recreation room]] with a pinball machine, a ping-pong table and other luxury items, prompting [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to ask how Homer could afford all this. He says he has a plan and in the next scene files for [[bankruptcy]] before [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Judge Constance Harm|Constance Harm]], believing that this will save him from paying his debts. Unfortunately, Harm tells him that the [[Bankruptcy in the United States#The creditors|bankruptcy laws have changed]] and, under the new laws, he has to pay everything back. When looking through the family's expenses, Homer decides to save a lot of money by moving [[Abraham Simpson|his father]] out of the [[retirement home]] and having him live with the family. The recreation room now doubles as Grampa's bedroom.\n\nHomer and Marge go out one night and ask Grampa to [[babysitting|babysit]] [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. Not entirely trusting Grampa's competence as a babysitter, Marge also asks her sister [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]] to come over and watch Grampa watch the kids. During the evening, Grampa and Selma end up kissing and eventually fall in love with each other, and are unaware that they are caught by Homer, much to his dismay, as he wants his dad to end up old and lonely. However, just as she was when Abe previously dated Selma's mother [[Jacqueline Bouvier (The Simpsons)|Jacqueline]] in \"[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]\", Marge is happy with the arrangement, noting that Selma and Abe are like a yummy hot dog made from the parts of a pig no one wants. Patty is no happier than Homer and she enlists his help to break them up. Patty impersonates Selma and Homer dresses up as \"Esteban de la Sexface\", a Spanish lover-type, and the two arrange for Grampa to catch them kissing. Their plan is foiled though, when the actual Selma comes by and catches them. Angry at being manipulated, Grampa proposes to Selma and she accepts. They get married and move in together.\n\nWith Abe unable to find work, Selma is the sole breadwinner in the family, working hard in her new, more stressful job as department manager at the DMV. Abe, meanwhile, destroys their kitchen with his ignorance of how things work by misusing the appliances, causing a kitchen [[fire]]. This makes Selma realise that maybe love is not everything you need after all, and she dances with him one last time. They presumably [[divorce]], with Grampa moving back to the retirement home and Selma moving back to her and Patty's room at Spinster Arms Apartments.\n\nKicked out of the rec room, Bart and Lisa order a lot of complimentary shipping boxes from the A.S.S. (American Shipping Services, not affiliated with the [[Buttocks|human ass]]), getting the idea from [[Ned Flanders]], and build a fort out of them. When the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]] becomes angry and asks for them back, they refuse, whereupon he threatens to come back and get them by force (while using a cliche [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]] accent). Bart and Lisa think he is bluffing, but in fact, he comes back with an army of delivery men and women. Bart and Lisa put up a brave fight, first by releasing a barrage of cardboard tubes to trip the enemies, then using cardboard squares to throw like [[shuriken]]. The delivery men and women set up a siege ladder and Lisa wraps the lead man in tape and pushes the ladder down. They are aided by [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]], who arrives unexpectedly to aid Lisa, saving her from a barrage of cardboard arrows. He dives down with twin cardboard tubes and fends off a large number of delivery men and women, while one of the enemies flies overhead, upon a giant, red [[Nazg\u00fbl#Steeds|Fell Beast]].\n\nThe army swarms while Bart uses a cardboard tube to shoot down enemies with bricks, beehives, egg cartons and [[Snowball II]]. The A.S.S. legion fails and flees, but the kids immediately lose interest in their fort and melt it with the garden hose (ignoring the dead Fell beast nearby).\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}\n*The title of this episode is a pun on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.\n*The episode \"[[Gump Roast]]\", broadcast [[The Simpsons (season 13)|five seasons earlier]], jokingly suggested that Selma and Grampa would marry in a future plotline during the ending song \"They'll Never Stop The Simpsons\", alongside other joke plotlines such as Marge becoming a robot.\n*To save gas, Homer says he is \"[[The Flintstones|Flintstoning]]\" the car (cutting a hole in the floor so he can stick his legs through and push the car, as [[Fred Flintstone]] does, with the same sound effect but not the same efficiency).

The eastern boundary is formed by the [[River Trent]]. Prior to 1884, the parish included {{convert|155|acre|ha}} of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of [[Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire|Kettlethorpe]].<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=23}}</ref> Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922.<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=7}}</ref> The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry.<ref>{{harvnb |Thirsk |1991 |p=68}}</ref> In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768\u20139 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are a number of [[listed building]]s in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1276573 |desc=Manor Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233547 |desc=Binge Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233548 |desc=Willow Tree Cottage, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable-ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233549 |desc=Willow Tree Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of the influence of the [[enclosure movement]], the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village.{{sfn |Workgroup |2006 |p=7}} Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of [[George III of England|George III]]'s reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's {{convert|1589|acre|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=142, 172}} There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 [[messuage]]s and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village.

There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. William was Prebendary of [[Bole]] by 1212 and Archdeacon of Durham by 1224 but in October 1243 'some men were imprisoned at York under suspicion of being concerned in his death.' <ref>Fast Ecclesiae Anglicanae, vol 6/26</ref>\n\nKing Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 <ref>Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255</ref> and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303<ref>Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7</ref>.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nIn the Stuart era William Tirwhitt (or Tyrwhitt) was a landowner in the village. He died in 1642 and by 1648 his Laneham lands were sequestered due to his being 'a delinquent Papist' and a 'Papist in arms' but they were restored after the Restoration.<ref>Calendar: Committee for Compounding, Part 3 September 1648, published 1891</ref>\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=284}}</ref>\n\nThe drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a {{convert|43|hp|kW|adj=on|abbr=on}} steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was {{convert|26.5|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|2.25|ft|m}} wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an [[Gwynnes Limited|Allen-Gwynnes]] {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} electric pump.<ref>{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=199}}</ref> With the passing of the [[Land Drainage Act 1930]], most land drainage authorities were superseded by [[Internal Drainage Board]]s (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for {{convert|78.5|mi|km}} of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} of low-lying land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |title=Laneham IDB \u2013 Summary details |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223023241/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |title=Laneham IDB Biodiversity Action Plan |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |date=January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093115/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811225709/http://naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=History |publisher=Trent Valley IDB |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Margery Ellen |last=Brown\n  |title=Aspects of Parliamentary Enclosure in Nottinghamshire\n  |publisher=Proquest for UMI Dissertation Publishing\n  |year=1995\n  |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/35536/1/U071859.pdf\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Charities\n  |title=Reports for Commissioners\n  |publisher=House of Commons\n  |year=1828\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=K.

The eastern boundary is formed by the [[River Trent]]. Prior to 1884, the parish included {{convert|155|acre|ha}} of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of [[Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire|Kettlethorpe]].<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=23}}</ref> Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922.<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=7}}</ref> The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry.<ref>{{harvnb |Thirsk |1991 |p=68}}</ref> In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768\u20139 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are a number of [[listed building]]s in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1276573 |desc=Manor Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233547 |desc=Binge Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233548 |desc=Willow Tree Cottage, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable-ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233549 |desc=Willow Tree Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of the influence of the [[enclosure movement]], the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village.{{sfn |Workgroup |2006 |p=7}} Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of [[George III of England|George III]]'s reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's {{convert|1589|acre|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=142, 172}} There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 [[messuage]]s and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799.<ref>{{cite work |title=Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society |volume=Vol 36|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/whs/36-2.pdf |editor-first=Rev John C |editor-last=Bowmer |date=June 1967 |p=59}}</ref> The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suggested Laneham Heritage Trails |publisher=Nottinghamshire County Council |p=1 |url=http://laneham.org.uk/LanehamLeaflet2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLaneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. William was Prebendary of [[Bole]] by 1212 and Archdeacon of Durham by 1224 but in October 1243 'some men were imprisoned at York under suspicion of being concerned in his death.' <ref>Fast Ecclesiae Anglicanae, vol 6/26</ref>\n\nKing Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 <ref>Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255</ref> and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303<ref>Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7</ref>.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nIn the Stuart era William Tirwhitt (or Tyrwhitt) was a landowner in the village. He died in 1642 and by 1648 his Laneham lands were sequestered due to his being 'a delinquent Papist' and a 'Papist in arms' but they were restored after the Restoration.<ref>Calendar: Committee for Compounding, Part 3 September 1648, published 1891</ref>\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=284}}</ref>\n\nThe drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a {{convert|43|hp|kW|adj=on|abbr=on}} steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was {{convert|26.5|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|2.25|ft|m}} wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an [[Gwynnes Limited|Allen-Gwynnes]] {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} electric pump.<ref>{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=199}}</ref> With the passing of the [[Land Drainage Act 1930]], most land drainage authorities were superseded by [[Internal Drainage Board]]s (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for {{convert|78.5|mi|km}} of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} of low-lying land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |title=Laneham IDB \u2013 Summary details |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223023241/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |title=Laneham IDB Biodiversity Action Plan |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |date=January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093115/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811225709/http://naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=History |publisher=Trent Valley IDB |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Margery Ellen |last=Brown\n  |title=Aspects of Parliamentary Enclosure in Nottinghamshire\n  |publisher=Proquest for UMI Dissertation Publishing\n  |year=1995\n  |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/35536/1/U071859.pdf\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Charities\n  |title=Reports for Commissioners\n  |publisher=House of Commons\n  |year=1828\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=K.

It is administered by the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] and is represented in council by Ward Councillor Ernest Smith as elected on the 7th August, 2019. Previously, the Ward Councillor was Martin Meyer til his election to the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] [[Provincial Legislature]]. Both represent the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] in their respective roles. \n\n==Location==\nThe suburb is a [[gentrified]] area of Durban located about {{convert|2|km|mi|1}} inland from the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, on the south bank of the [[Umgeni River]]. Its neighboring suburbs are [[Puntans Hill, Durban|Puntans Hill]] to the west, [[Essenwood, Durban|Essenwood]] to the south-west, [[Windermere, Durban|Windermere]] to the south and [[Stamford Hill, Durban|Stamford Hill]] to the east. \n\n==Layout and attractions==\nThe Morningside area contains classical examples of large [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style homes with tin roofs and wide verandas, including the State President's residence (when at home).
