There was no uniformity of party names until 1918, when Federal Conference resolved that state branches should adopt the name \"Australian Labor Party\" \u2013 now spelled without a {{angbr|u}}.

The liberal government of [[Charles Kingston]] was formed with the support of the ULP, ousting the conservative government of [[John Downer]].

However, the first Labour<!-- Do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context. --> leader and Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] was a supporter of federation.\n\nHistorian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales, argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative.  After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks.<ref>Celia Hamilton, \"Irish\u2010Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890\u20131910.\" ''Historical Studies: Australia & New Zealand'' (1958) 8#31: 254\u2013267.</ref>\n\n=== Early decades at the federal level ===\nThe [[1901 Australian federal election|federal parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour Party.

The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank]].\n\nThe Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement.

This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about \"[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]\" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In practice the Labor party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.\n\n=== World War II and beyond ===\n[[File:JohnCurtin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[John Curtin]], Prime Minister 1941\u201345]]\n[[File:Frank Forde 1941 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Frank Forde]], Prime Minister 1945]]\n[[File:Benchifley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ben Chifley]], Prime Minister 1945\u201349]]\nThe [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of the [[Second World War]] and initial stages of transition to peace.

Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that \"Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom\", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Menzies Government]]).

According to the Labor Party's website, \"The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007 |access-date=23 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820193739/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |archive-date=20 August 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that \"Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.\" While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: \"Labor believes in a strong role for national government \u2013 the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.\" Labor \"will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.\" The platform and Labor \"believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.\" For Labor, \"government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.\" Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.\n\nIn practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform.\n\n== Party structure ==\n{{labour|sp=uk|expanded=parties}}\n{{labour politics in Australia}}\n\n=== National Executive and Secretariat ===\nThe [[Australian Labor Party National Executive]] is the chief administrative authority of the Australian Labor Party, subject only to Labor's [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|National Conference]]. The Executive is responsible for organising the triennial National Conference; carrying out the decisions of National Conference; interpreting the National Constitution, the National Platform and decisions of National Conference; and directing federal members.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALP National Platform 2011 |url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |website=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=9 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182841/http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}</ref>\n\nThe party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference decides the party's platform, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|national executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[Paul Erickson (trade unionist)|Paul Erickson]]. The most recent National Conference was the 48th conference held in December 2018.<ref>ALP: [[2018 Australian Labor Party National Conference]]</ref>\n\nThe head office of the ALP, the National Secretariat, is managed by the National Secretary. It plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy. It acts as a permanent secretariat to the National Executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party. As the National Secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections, it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation.\n\n=== Federal Parliamentary Labor Party ===\nThe elected members of the Labor party in both houses of the national Parliament meet as the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, also known as the [[Australian Labor Party Caucus]] (see also [[Caucus#Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa|caucus]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=215}}</ref> Besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics, the Caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders.\n\nUntil 2013, the parliamentary leaders were elected by the Caucus from among its members. The leader has historically been a member of the House of Representatives. Since October 2013, a ballot of both the Caucus and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-elected-labor-leader-20131013-2vfzy.html|title=Bill Shorten elected Labor leader|author=Harrison, Bill|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> When the Labor Party is in government, the party leader is the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and the deputy leader is the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]]. If a Labor prime minister resigns or dies in office, the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected. The deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers.\n\n=== State and territory branches ===\n{{main|List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party}}\nThe Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office.\n\nMembers join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income.  The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are [[political funding in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].\n\nMembers are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\nIn some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.\n\n=== Country Labor ===\n'''Country Labor''' is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas. It functions as a sort of [[ginger group]] within the party, and is somewhat analogous to [[Australian Young Labor|its youth wing]]. The '''Country Labor Party''' is registered as a separate party in [[New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/candidates_and_parties/registered_political_parties/list_of_registered_parties List of Registered Parties], Electoral Commission NSW.</ref> and is also registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) for federal elections.<ref name=aec>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ Current register of political parties], Australian Electoral Commission.</ref> It does not have the same status in other states, and consequently that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper.\n\nThe creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the June 1999 ALP state conference in New South Wales. In May 2000, following Labor's success at the [[2000 Benalla state by-election|2000 Benalla by-election]] in Victoria, [[Kim Beazley]] announced that the ALP intended to register a separate \"Country Labor Party\" with the AEC;<ref name=boland>[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/country-labor-new-direction Country Labor: a new direction?], 7 June 2000. Retrieved 29 September 2017</ref> this occurred in October 2000.<ref name=aec/> The Country Labor designation is most frequently used in New South Wales. According to the ALP's financial statements for the 2015\u201316 financial year, NSW Country Labor had around 2,600 members (around 17 percent of the party total), but almost no assets. It recorded a severe funding shortfall at the [[2015 New South Wales state election|2015 New South Wales election]], and had to rely on a $1.68-million loan from the party proper to remain solvent. It had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources, but the NSW Electoral Commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately. Instead the party proper had to loan Country Labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/nearinsolvent-country-labor-may-never-repay-168m-to-party/news-story/b760e84faa14fda082bbb33600ec4743 Near-insolvent Country Labor \u2018may never repay\u2019 $1.68m to party], ''[[The Australian]]'', 28 July 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Australian Young Labor ===\n{{main|Australian Young Labor}}\nAustralian Young Labor is the youth wing of the Australian Labor Party, where all members under age 26 are automatically members. It is the peak youth body within the ALP. Former presidents of AYL have included former NSW Premier Bob Carr, Federal Manager of Opposition Business Tony Burke, former Special Minister of State Senator John Faulkner, former Australian Workers Union National Secretary and current Member for Maribyrnong and former Federal Labor Leader Bill Shorten as well as dozens of State Ministers and MPs. The current national president is Liam O'Regan from Queensland.\n\n=== Networks ===\nThe Australian Labor Party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. The national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=232}}</ref> Examples of such groups include the Labor Environment Action Network,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lean.net.au/|title=Labor Environment Action Network|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Rainbow Labor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923163414/http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |archivedate=23 September 2011 }}</ref> and Labor for Refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/labor4refugees|title=Labor for Refugees|work=Facebook|accessdate=11 June 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref> The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently{{clarify|date=May 2016}} gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference.\n\n== Factions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nThe Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (National Right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] (National Left). Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Socialist Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more liberal on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland.\n\nSome trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU).<ref name=\"afr.com\">{{cite web |last1=Marin-Guzman |first1=David |title=Inside the union factions that rule the ALP conference |url=https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/inside-the-union-factions-that-rule-the-alp-conference-20181216-h19692 |website=Australian Financial Review |accessdate=6 August 2019|date=16 December 2018 }}</ref> Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMMEU) and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] (CPSU).<ref name=\"afr.com\"/>\n\n[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.\n\n== Federal parliamentary leaders ==\n{{main|Leaders of the Australian Labor Party}}\n[[Anthony Albanese]] is the leader of the federal Labor party, serving since 30 May 2019.

There was no uniformity of party names until 1918, when Federal Conference resolved that state branches should adopt the name \"Australian Labor Party\" \u2013 now spelled without a {{angbr|u}}.

The [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], New South Wales branch of the party claims to be the oldest in Australia. Labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|New South Wales]] and [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|South Australia]], 1893 in Queensland, and later in the other colonies.\n\nThe first election contested by Labour candidates was the [[1891 New South Wales colonial election|1891 New South Wales election]], when Labour candidates (then called the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales) won 35 of 141 seats. The major parties were the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] and [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] parties and Labour held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].

The liberal government of [[Charles Kingston]] was formed with the support of the ULP, ousting the conservative government of [[John Downer]].

However, the first Labour<!-- Do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context. --> leader and Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] was a supporter of federation.\n\nHistorian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales, argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative.  After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks.<ref>Celia Hamilton, \"Irish\u2010Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890\u20131910.\" ''Historical Studies: Australia & New Zealand'' (1958) 8#31: 254\u2013267.</ref>\n\n=== Early decades at the federal level ===\nThe [[1901 Australian federal election|federal parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour Party.

In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies; in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders.\n\n[[File:Portrait of the Right Hon.

The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the \"[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment,\" which said that \"socialisation\" was desirable only when was necessary to \"eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.\"{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=53}} In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank]].\n\nThe Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=19}} Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism.\n\nHistorically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the White Australia policy, which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about \"[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]\" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In practice the Labor party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.\n\n=== World War II and beyond ===\n[[File:JohnCurtin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[John Curtin]], Prime Minister 1941\u201345]]\n[[File:Frank Forde 1941 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Frank Forde]], Prime Minister 1945]]\n[[File:Benchifley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ben Chifley]], Prime Minister 1945\u201349]]\nThe [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of the [[Second World War]] and initial stages of transition to peace.

According to the Labor Party's website, \"The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007 |access-date=23 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820193739/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |archive-date=20 August 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that \"Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.\" While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: \"Labor believes in a strong role for national government \u2013 the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.\" Labor \"will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.\" The platform and Labor \"believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.\" For Labor, \"government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.\" Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.\n\nIn practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform.\n\n== Party structure ==\n{{labour|sp=uk|expanded=parties}}\n{{labour politics in Australia}}\n\n=== National Executive and Secretariat ===\nThe [[Australian Labor Party National Executive]] is the chief administrative authority of the Australian Labor Party, subject only to Labor's [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|National Conference]]. The Executive is responsible for organising the triennial National Conference; carrying out the decisions of National Conference; interpreting the National Constitution, the National Platform and decisions of National Conference; and directing federal members.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALP National Platform 2011 |url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |website=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=9 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182841/http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}</ref>\n\nThe party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference decides the party's platform, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|national executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[Paul Erickson (trade unionist)|Paul Erickson]]. The most recent National Conference was the 48th conference held in December 2018.<ref>ALP: [[2018 Australian Labor Party National Conference]]</ref>\n\nThe head office of the ALP, the National Secretariat, is managed by the National Secretary. It plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy. It acts as a permanent secretariat to the National Executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party. As the National Secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections, it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation.\n\n=== Federal Parliamentary Labor Party ===\nThe elected members of the Labor party in both houses of the national Parliament meet as the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, also known as the [[Australian Labor Party Caucus]] (see also [[Caucus#Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa|caucus]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=215}}</ref> Besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics, the Caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders.\n\nUntil 2013, the parliamentary leaders were elected by the Caucus from among its members. The leader has historically been a member of the House of Representatives. Since October 2013, a ballot of both the Caucus and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-elected-labor-leader-20131013-2vfzy.html|title=Bill Shorten elected Labor leader|author=Harrison, Bill|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> When the Labor Party is in government, the party leader is the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and the deputy leader is the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]]. If a Labor prime minister resigns or dies in office, the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected. The deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers.\n\n=== State and territory branches ===\n{{main|List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party}}\nThe Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office.\n\nMembers join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income.  The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are [[political funding in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].\n\nMembers are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\nIn some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.\n\n=== Country Labor ===\n'''Country Labor''' is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas. It functions as a sort of [[ginger group]] within the party, and is somewhat analogous to [[Australian Young Labor|its youth wing]]. The '''Country Labor Party''' is registered as a separate party in [[New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/candidates_and_parties/registered_political_parties/list_of_registered_parties List of Registered Parties], Electoral Commission NSW.</ref> and is also registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) for federal elections.<ref name=aec>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ Current register of political parties], Australian Electoral Commission.</ref> It does not have the same status in other states, and consequently that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper.\n\nThe creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the June 1999 ALP state conference in New South Wales. In May 2000, following Labor's success at the [[2000 Benalla state by-election|2000 Benalla by-election]] in Victoria, [[Kim Beazley]] announced that the ALP intended to register a separate \"Country Labor Party\" with the AEC;<ref name=boland>[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/country-labor-new-direction Country Labor: a new direction?], 7 June 2000. Retrieved 29 September 2017</ref> this occurred in October 2000.<ref name=aec/> The Country Labor designation is most frequently used in New South Wales. According to the ALP's financial statements for the 2015\u201316 financial year, NSW Country Labor had around 2,600 members (around 17 percent of the party total), but almost no assets. It recorded a severe funding shortfall at the [[2015 New South Wales state election|2015 New South Wales election]], and had to rely on a $1.68-million loan from the party proper to remain solvent. It had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources, but the NSW Electoral Commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately. Instead the party proper had to loan Country Labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/nearinsolvent-country-labor-may-never-repay-168m-to-party/news-story/b760e84faa14fda082bbb33600ec4743 Near-insolvent Country Labor \u2018may never repay\u2019 $1.68m to party], ''[[The Australian]]'', 28 July 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Australian Young Labor ===\n{{main|Australian Young Labor}}\nAustralian Young Labor is the youth wing of the Australian Labor Party, where all members under age 26 are automatically members. It is the peak youth body within the ALP. Former presidents of AYL have included former NSW Premier Bob Carr, Federal Manager of Opposition Business Tony Burke, former Special Minister of State Senator John Faulkner, former Australian Workers Union National Secretary and current Member for Maribyrnong and former Federal Labor Leader Bill Shorten as well as dozens of State Ministers and MPs. The current national president is Liam O'Regan from Queensland.\n\n=== Networks ===\nThe Australian Labor Party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. The national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=232}}</ref> Examples of such groups include the Labor Environment Action Network,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lean.net.au/|title=Labor Environment Action Network|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Rainbow Labor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923163414/http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |archivedate=23 September 2011 }}</ref> and Labor for Refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/labor4refugees|title=Labor for Refugees|work=Facebook|accessdate=11 June 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref> The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently{{clarify|date=May 2016}} gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference.\n\n== Factions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nThe Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (National Right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] (National Left). Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Socialist Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more liberal on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland.\n\nSome trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU).<ref name=\"afr.com\">{{cite web |last1=Marin-Guzman |first1=David |title=Inside the union factions that rule the ALP conference |url=https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/inside-the-union-factions-that-rule-the-alp-conference-20181216-h19692 |website=Australian Financial Review |accessdate=6 August 2019|date=16 December 2018 }}</ref> Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMMEU) and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] (CPSU).<ref name=\"afr.com\"/>\n\n[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.\n\n== Federal parliamentary leaders ==\n{{main|Leaders of the Australian Labor Party}}\n[[Anthony Albanese]] is the leader of the federal Labor party, serving since 30 May 2019.

He was often in trouble with the police for masturbating in public and minesweeping in the \u2018Armpit\u2019.  The film's popularity led to an  [[NBC]] television series of the same name. The title character, played by [[Dan Haggerty]], was loosely based on California mountain man [[James \"Grizzly\" Adams]] (1812\u20131860).\n\nThe film and TV series portrayed the fictional Grizzly Adams as a frontier [[woodsman]] who fled into the mountains after he was wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams saves an orphaned [[grizzly bear]] cub he adopts and names Ben. The bear, while growing to its huge adult size, becomes Adams' closest companion. Consistently kind and gentle, Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, and he helps, sometimes rescues, takes in and tames many species. Originally a hunter, with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible. In the television series, Adams had two human friends, an old mountain man trader named \"Mad Jack\" played by [[Denver Pyle]] who was often featured with his mule (\"Number Seven\"), and a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] by the name of \"Nakoma\" played by [[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]]. Adams, Mad Jack, and Nakoma helped myriad mountain visitors while protecting wildlife at the same time.\n\nNBC aired the series finale on February 21, 1982 by way of a two-hour [[TV movie]] called ''The Capture of Grizzly Adams'' where a [[bounty hunter]] used Adams' daughter, who was not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film, in a kidnap-extortion ploy to lure the fugitive mountain man back to civilization. In the end Adams proves his innocence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dan Haggerty]] as James Capen 'Grizzly' Adams\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Mad Jack\n* [[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]] as Nakoma\n* John Bishop as Robbie Cartman\n* Bozo (a grizzly bear) as Ben (named after [[Benjamin Franklin]])\n\nIn addition to Ben, there were many other named animals in the TV series, the most prominent being ''Number 7'', Mad Jack's ornery [[mule]]. [[Bart the Bear]], then a bear cub, made one of his first acting appearances in the series playing Ben as a cub.<ref>http://bartthebear.com/credits/</ref><ref>Rosen, Leah, with Tom Gliatto and Cathy Free,  [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123481,00.html \"State of Bruin\",] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Oct. 20, 1997, available online at People.com, accessed May 27, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Grizzly Adams'' was created and produced by Schick Sunn Classic Pictures, a company based in [[Park City, Utah]] and operated by its founding executives, Patrick Frawley, Charles E. Sellier Jr., and Rayland Jenson. Parts of the film were shot in the [[Uinta National Forest]], [[Wasatch National Forest]], and Park City.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> The low-budget independent studio successfully introduced innovative marketing and promotional methods. Its 1974 'Grizzly Adams' movie was a runaway success. Produced on a small $140,000 budget, the film grossed over $45 million at the domestic box office<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1975/00233.php|title= Box Office Information for ''The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams''|accessdate=July 7, 2012|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]}}</ref> and $65 million worldwide.<ref name=\"reboot\"/> It was the [[1974 in film|7th highest grossing film of 1974]]. The 43% market share captured by a 1976 airing of the film on [[NBC]] led to network executives green-lighting the television series. The series drew a 32% market share, a significant figure to this day. The series also aired at a time when the [[environmental movement]] flourished.\n\nBozo was purchased from a Kansas zoo, and trained by R.E. (Bob) Leonard.<ref name=\"Woolery\">{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981, Part II: Live, Film, and Tape Series |date=1985 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1651-2 |pages=293-295}}</ref>\n\nThe show's theme song, \u201cMaybe,\u201d was written and sung by [[Thom Pace]]. The song was released as a single in [[Europe]], where it reached number one, and in 1980 won Germany's [[Goldene Europa]] award for best song.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} At the beginning of each episode, part of the theme song is sung, while at the end, the entire theme song is sung.  \"Mad Jack\" also introduces the circumstances of Grizzly Adams, referring to him as a \"greenhorn\", his friendship with Ben and all of the animals. After selling many products bearing the Grizzly Adams brand name, the brand was eventually trademarked by its creator, film producer, Charles E. Sellier, Jr. Following Sellier's death in early 2011, the brand rights were transferred to Grizzly Adams LLC.\n\nProduction for the series also took place in Utah, with location work in [[Arizona]] and [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]], depending on weather conditions, due to the similarities in terrain. As with the film, animals were provided and trained by the [[Olympic Game Farm]], housed at a second game farm built at [[Woodland, Utah|Woodland]]. A scaled-down version of Grizzly Adams' cabin, used to make Dan Haggerty appear taller, is currently located at the Olympic Game Farm in [[Sequim, Washington]].<ref name=\"Wilderness Trails\">{{cite book |last=Beebe |first=Lloyd |date= 2005 |title= Wilderness Trails And A Dream: The Story Behind the Olympic Game Farm, Third Edition|url= https://olygamefarm.com/ |location= Forks, WA |publisher= Olympic Graphic Arts, Inc. |page= 159-161|isbn= 0-615-12878-5 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" <!-- note dates are in a sortable format, please do not change -->\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Ep\n!

Sellier Jr.]]. The film's popularity led to an  [[NBC]] television series of the same name. The title character, played by [[Dan Haggerty]], was loosely based on California mountain man [[James \"Grizzly\" Adams]] (1812\u20131860).\n\nThe film and TV series portrayed the fictional Grizzly Adams as a frontier [[woodsman]] who fled into the mountains after he was wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams saves an orphaned [[grizzly bear]] cub he adopts and names Ben. The bear, while growing to its huge adult size, becomes Adams' closest companion. Consistently kind and gentle, Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, and he helps, sometimes rescues, takes in and tames many species. Originally a hunter, with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible. In the television series, Adams had two human friends, an old mountain man trader named \"Mad Jack\" played by [[Denver Pyle]] who was often featured with his mule (\"Number Seven\"), and a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] by the name of \"Nakoma\" played by [[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]]. Adams, Mad Jack, and Nakoma helped myriad mountain visitors while protecting wildlife at the same time.\n\nNBC aired the series finale on February 21, 1982 by way of a two-hour [[TV movie]] called ''The Capture of Grizzly Adams'' where a [[bounty hunter]] used Adams' daughter, who was not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film, in a kidnap-extortion ploy to lure the fugitive mountain man back to civilization. In the end Adams proves his innocence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dan Haggerty]] as James Capen 'Grizzly' Adams\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Mad Jack\n* [[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]] as Nakoma\n* John Bishop as Robbie Cartman\n* Bozo (a grizzly bear) as Ben (named after [[Benjamin Franklin]])\n\nIn addition to Ben, there were many other named animals in the TV series, the most prominent being ''Number 7'', Mad Jack's ornery [[mule]]. [[Bart the Bear]], then a bear cub, made one of his first acting appearances in the series playing Ben as a cub.<ref>http://bartthebear.com/credits/</ref><ref>Rosen, Leah, with Tom Gliatto and Cathy Free,  [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123481,00.html \"State of Bruin\",] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Oct. 20, 1997, available online at People.com, accessed May 27, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Grizzly Adams'' was created and produced by Schick Sunn Classic Pictures, a company based in [[Park City, Utah]] and operated by its founding executives, Patrick Frawley, Charles E. Sellier Jr., and Rayland Jenson. Parts of the film were shot in the [[Uinta National Forest]], [[Wasatch National Forest]], and Park City.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> The low-budget independent studio successfully introduced innovative marketing and promotional methods. Its 1974 'Grizzly Adams' movie was a runaway success.

The 43% market share captured by a 1976 airing of the film on [[NBC]] led to network executives green-lighting the television series. The series drew a 32% market share, a significant figure to this day. The series also aired at a time when the [[environmental movement]] flourished.\n\nBozo was purchased from a Kansas zoo, and trained by R.E. (Bob) Leonard.<ref name=\"Woolery\">{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981, Part II: Live, Film, and Tape Series |date=1985 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1651-2 |pages=293-295}}</ref>\n\nThe show's theme song, \u201cMaybe,\u201d was written and sung by [[Thom Pace]]. The song was released as a single in [[Europe]], where it reached number one, and in 1980 won Germany's [[Goldene Europa]] award for best song.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} At the beginning of each episode, part of the theme song is sung, while at the end, the entire theme song is sung.  \"Mad Jack\" also introduces the circumstances of Grizzly Adams, referring to him as a \"greenhorn\", his friendship with Ben and all of the animals. After selling many products bearing the Grizzly Adams brand name, the brand was eventually trademarked by its creator, film producer, Charles E. Sellier, Jr. Following Sellier's death in early 2011, the brand rights were transferred to Grizzly Adams LLC.\n\nProduction for the series also took place in Utah, with location work in [[Arizona]] and [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]], depending on weather conditions, due to the similarities in terrain. As with the film, animals were provided and trained by the [[Olympic Game Farm]], housed at a second game farm built at [[Woodland, Utah|Woodland]]. A scaled-down version of Grizzly Adams' cabin, used to make Dan Haggerty appear taller, is currently located at the Olympic Game Farm in [[Sequim, Washington]].<ref name=\"Wilderness Trails\">{{cite book |last=Beebe |first=Lloyd |date= 2005 |title= Wilderness Trails And A Dream: The Story Behind the Olympic Game Farm, Third Edition|url= https://olygamefarm.com/ |location= Forks, WA |publisher= Olympic Graphic Arts, Inc. |page= 159-161|isbn= 0-615-12878-5 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" <!-- note dates are in a sortable format, please do not change -->\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Ep\n!

He tells the story of his experience of love in a flashback. A few years ago, in [[London]], a chance meeting in a disco between Ayan, the son of a millionaire, a novice in terms of sex-related matters, and Alizeh Khan ([[Anushka Sharma]]), who knows about sex a little more, ends up with them trying to make out, and it turning into a comedy. They get to know about each other and become friends. Later, when they discover their respective partners are cheating on them, they break up with their lovers: Ayan with Lisa D'Souza and Alizeh with \"Dr.\" Faisal Khan and the two go to Paris to spend a week together. While Ayan falls in love with Alizeh but does not tell her while she considers him to be only a \"friend\". One day, Alizeh stumbles upon DJ Ali, her ex-boyfriend/lover, who wants to reconcile. Partially confused, but still in love with him, Alizeh decides to go with DJ Ali, and so unintentionally stops hanging out with Ayan and they cease communication.\n\nA few days later, Alizeh calls and invites Ayan to her wedding with DJ Ali in [[Lucknow]]. Ayan is petrified on hearing this but agrees to the invitation. At the wedding, he tells Alizeh he loves her but she rejects his feelings causing Ayan to leave the ceremony heartbroken. At the airport to board a flight to [[Dubai]], he meets Saba Taliyar Khan ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), a poet, who is leaving for [[Vienna]]. She consoles Ayan and gives him a book with her poetry and number on it. Ayan calls after three months stating that he is in Vienna and wants to meet her. He learns that Saba is divorced and has no place for love in her heart. Later, he also meets Saba's ex-husband, Tahir Taliyar Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) in a fine arts gallery, who tells him that one-sided love is not a weakness but empowering. Ayan, who had blocked Alizeh from contacting him in all ways, finally calls and reconnects with her. He begins to send pictures of Saba to her to try and induce jealousy.\n\nOne day Alizeh informs Ayan that she's coming to Vienna and wants to meet him. Ayan invites her for dinner with Saba to provoke Alizeh into loving him, but Alizeh thinks Ayan has found love in Saba and is happy for him. Meanwhile, Saba begins to develop feelings for Ayan, but he loves Alizeh. Seeing his love for Alizeh, Saba asks him to leave.\n\nAyan continues to harbor love for Alizeh and becomes a famous singer with his channel. He meets Ali one day and realizes that Ali and Alizeh  have parted ways. Ayan goes to Alizeh's favorite spot and waits there until she arrives. Alizeh tells Ayan that she is diagnosed with cancer stage IV and will not live much longer. Ayan and Alizeh try to make the best of their time together. Ayan tries to make Alizeh love him, to no avail. This leads to a fight between the two, and Alizeh decides to leave Ayan. Next morning Ayan tries to search for Alizeh, apparently reaching the airport and thus fulfilling her last wish also before death. Eventually, Ayan makes peace with the fact that he and Alizeh can at least be friends and nothing more. Alizeh dies soon. The screen blacks out and comes back to the present where Ayan, still a popular singer, is giving an interview based on the love of his life. Ayan sings the song ''\"[[Channa Mereya]]\"'', which is inspired by his one-sided love story, and finishes the interview.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ayan Sanger\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Alizeh Khan\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Saba Taliyar Khan\n*[[Fawad Khan]] as DJ Ali\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n*[[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Tahir Taliyar Khan, Saba's ex-husband\n* [[Imran Abbas]] as Dr. Faisal Khan, Alizeh's boyfriend\n* [[Lisa Haydon]] as Lisa D'Souza, Ayan's girlfriend\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] as Nisha (Alizeh's DJ friend) in the song \"The Breakup Song\"\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as the reporter (voiceover)\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"...it is not a conventional love story or love triangle.

He tells the story of his experience of love in a flashback. A few years ago, in [[London]], a chance meeting in a disco between Ayan, the son of a millionaire, a novice in terms of sex-related matters, and Alizeh Khan ([[Anushka Sharma]]), who knows about sex a little more, ends up with them trying to make out, and it turning into a comedy. They get to know about each other and become friends. Later, when they discover their respective partners are cheating on them, they break up with their lovers: Ayan with Lisa D'Souza and Alizeh with \"Dr.\" Faisal Khan and the two go to Paris to spend a week together. While Ayan falls in love with Alizeh but does not tell her while she considers him to be only a \"friend\". One day, Alizeh stumbles upon DJ Ali, her ex-boyfriend/lover, who wants to reconcile. Partially confused, but still in love with him, Alizeh decides to go with DJ Ali, and so unintentionally stops hanging out with Ayan and they cease communication.\n\nA few days later, Alizeh calls and invites Ayan to her wedding with DJ Ali in [[Lucknow]]. Ayan is petrified on hearing this but agrees to the invitation. At the wedding, he tells Alizeh he loves her but she rejects his feelings causing Ayan to leave the ceremony heartbroken. At the airport to board a flight to [[Dubai]], he meets Saba Taliyar Khan ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), a poet, who is leaving for [[Vienna]]. She consoles Ayan and gives him a book with her poetry and number on it. Ayan calls after three months stating that he is in Vienna and wants to meet her. He learns that Saba is divorced and has no place for love in her heart. Later, he also meets Saba's ex-husband, Tahir Taliyar Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) in a fine arts gallery, who tells him that one-sided love is not a weakness but empowering. Ayan, who had blocked Alizeh from contacting him in all ways, finally calls and reconnects with her. He begins to send pictures of Saba to her to try and induce jealousy.\n\nOne day Alizeh informs Ayan that she's coming to Vienna and wants to meet him. Ayan invites her for dinner with Saba to provoke Alizeh into loving him, but Alizeh thinks Ayan has found love in Saba and is happy for him. Meanwhile, Saba begins to develop feelings for Ayan, but he loves Alizeh. Seeing his love for Alizeh, Saba asks him to leave.\n\nAyan continues to harbor love for Alizeh and becomes a famous singer with his channel. He meets Ali one day and realizes that Ali and Alizeh  have parted ways. Ayan goes to Alizeh's favorite spot and waits there until she arrives. Alizeh tells Ayan that she is diagnosed with cancer stage IV and will not live much longer. Ayan and Alizeh try to make the best of their time together. Ayan tries to make Alizeh love him, to no avail. This leads to a fight between the two, and Alizeh decides to leave Ayan. Next morning Ayan tries to search for Alizeh, apparently reaching the airport and thus fulfilling her last wish also before death. Eventually, Ayan makes peace with the fact that he and Alizeh can at least be friends and nothing more. Alizeh dies soon. The screen blacks out and comes back to the present where Ayan, still a popular singer, is giving an interview based on the love of his life. Ayan sings the song ''\"[[Channa Mereya]]\"'', which is inspired by his one-sided love story, and finishes the interview.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ayan Sanger\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Alizeh Khan\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Saba Taliyar Khan\n*[[Fawad Khan]] as DJ Ali\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n*[[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Tahir Taliyar Khan, Saba's ex-husband\n* [[Imran Abbas]] as Dr. Faisal Khan, Alizeh's boyfriend\n* [[Lisa Haydon]] as Lisa D'Souza, Ayan's girlfriend\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] as Nisha (Alizeh's DJ friend) in the song \"The Breakup Song\"\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as the reporter (voiceover)\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"...it is not a conventional love story or love triangle.

Writer-director [[Karan Johar]] said that for the past year and a half, he had been developing a story that he needed to work on for several months. However, while he was in New York, the idea for ''Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'' (Title taken from a song of 1956 film ''[[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]]'') came to him and he wrote the screenplay in 30 days.

The series began broadcasting on 16 October 2013 on [[Sky Atlantic]] in the UK, and on 11 November 2013 on [[Canal+]] in France. The series stars [[Stephen Dillane]] and [[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]] as British and French police detectives Karl Roebuck and [[Elise Wassermann]]. The plot follows the two detectives working together to find a serial killer who left the upper half of a French politician and the lower half of a British prostitute in the [[Channel Tunnel]] at the midpoint between France and the UK. The killer is nicknamed the \"Truth Terrorist\" and is on a moral crusade to highlight many social problems, terrorising both countries in the process. As the series progresses, the killer's true intention is revealed.\n\nThe Anglo\u2013French adaptation of ''The Bridge'' was announced as a joint project between Sky and Canal+ in January 2013. ''Tunnel'' head writer Ben Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the creator of the original series. Due to the setting, the dialogue of the series is bilingual, a first for a British / French television co-production. Filming took place between February and August 2013 with a budget of \u00a315 million, and was shot on location in [[Kent]], England and [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], France. It was produced with both British and French crew members. The premieres on both Sky Atlantic and Canal+ received strong ratings for the respective channels, with an initial consolidated figure of almost 900,000 in the UK and 1.3 million in France. Critical reception of the series has been generally positive, with Dillane and Po\u00e9sy's acting being praised, as well as the plot's grittiness. Some reviewers made favourable comparisons with ''The Bridge'', though others criticised ''The Tunnel'' for being identical.

(Danish/Swedish TV series)|The Bridge]]'' (''Broen'', ''Bron''). The series began broadcasting on 16 October 2013 on [[Sky Atlantic]] in the UK, and on 11 November 2013 on [[Canal+]] in France. The series stars [[Stephen Dillane]] and [[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]] as British and French police detectives Karl Roebuck and [[Elise Wassermann]]. The plot follows the two detectives working together to find a serial killer who left the upper half of a French politician and the lower half of a British prostitute in the [[Channel Tunnel]] at the midpoint between France and the UK. The killer is nicknamed the \"Truth Terrorist\" and is on a moral crusade to highlight many social problems, terrorising both countries in the process. As the series progresses, the killer's true intention is revealed.\n\nThe Anglo\u2013French adaptation of ''The Bridge'' was announced as a joint project between Sky and Canal+ in January 2013. ''Tunnel'' head writer Ben Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the creator of the original series. Due to the setting, the dialogue of the series is bilingual, a first for a British / French television co-production. Filming took place between February and August 2013 with a budget of \u00a315 million, and was shot on location in [[Kent]], England and [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], France. It was produced with both British and French crew members. The premieres on both Sky Atlantic and Canal+ received strong ratings for the respective channels, with an initial consolidated figure of almost 900,000 in the UK and 1.3 million in France. Critical reception of the series has been generally positive, with Dillane and Po\u00e9sy's acting being praised, as well as the plot's grittiness. Some reviewers made favourable comparisons with ''The Bridge'', though others criticised ''The Tunnel'' for being identical.

The girls forgive Jack and Annie decides to let Mr. Mitch off the hook at the insistence of Duncan.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Witch Day\n| DirectedBy      = Anne Walker Farrell\n| WrittenBy       = Ava Tramer & Eddie Quintana\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|8}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ05\n| Viewers         = 1.09<ref name=\"1.04\">{{cite web|url= http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-8-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.8.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 10, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = It is Witch Day and the whole town is celebrating. Jack and Annie discover that their neighbor, Mrs. Martin, has died and steal her chili recipe with the help of Jing; having won the past ten years. Mia finds the holiday offensive as it involves burning a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 witch in celebration of Oak Dale's terrible historic past. Duncan at first pays no mind, but when he is elected the new town virgin for the holiday (the previous virgin got pregnant), he and his friends decide to steal the witch. Bex, who was a distraction, lets slip that Duncan and his friends are the culprits and drag them back for the burning. Duncan threatens everyone by reading their darkest secrets, which were to be burned with the witch, and everyone lays off. Mia admits that she likes the festivities, but that everyone should be more aware of the history. Annie, having realized what she is doing to her son, apologizes for putting his name up as a virgin and she and Jack win the chili cook off. Kimberly awaits for a boy that she likes, but accidentally scares him away.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Fridgy\n| DirectedBy      = Adam Henry\n| WrittenBy       = [[John Viener]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|15}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ03\n| Viewers         = 1.17<ref name=\"1.05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-15-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.15.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The Harrises' refrigerator finally breaks down after years of use and they head to the store to buy a new one. They are greeted by Janine who presents them with a smart fridge from ConVee. The Harrises are happy with the fridge, which they name Fridgy, as it can perform all of their tasks and chores giving them ample time to do the things they have always wanted to do. However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base. The family dig up their old busted refrigerator and \"enjoy\" their family time together. \n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Sister, Wife\n| DirectedBy      = Chuck Sheetz\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Julie Thacker Scully & Amy Poehler|t=Andrew Lee}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|22}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ06\n| Viewers         = 1.07<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-22-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.22.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jack and Annie decide to spend their anniversary by shopping at the home improvement store and take Kimberly with them, though they continuously fail to remember that she is with them.

The kids tell Jack and Annie that they are boring and they decide to prove them wrong by going out. After many failed excursions, they end up at an 80's themed bar, but Annie gets mad at Jack when he refuses to punch a guy that was hitting on her.

Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age.

These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.\n\nAmong the [[Apache Indians]], \"the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing\".<ref name=benedict /> A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of \"a degree of supernatural power\" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the \"power of evil\".\n\nThe [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men \"fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy\".<ref name=frazer /><!--{{rp|606}}-->\n\nIn earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.<ref name=Arachige2009 >{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

Sue's first hit record came in 1958 with \"Itchy Twitchy Feeling\" by [[Bobby Hendricks]] which peaked at #25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Success continued into the sixties with a handful of singles by R&B duo [[Ike & Tina Turner]] between 1960 and 1962. \"Mockingbird\" by brother-and-sister duo [[Inez and Charlie Foxx]] was a hit on the subsidiary label Symbol in 1963. Sue also had hits on the charts with \"Stick Shift\" by [[the Duals]], \"Hurt by Love\" by Inez Foxx and \"That's How Heartaches Are Made\" by [[Baby Washington|Justine \"Baby\" Washington]]. Sue also released early recordings by the soul singer [[Don Covay]] and albums by the [[Soul jazz|soul-jazz]] organist [[Jimmy McGriff]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] signed his first recording contract with Sue in 1965, but no recordings were released.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hendrix|first=Jimi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoVmCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Copa+Management+juggy+murray#v=onepage|title=Hendrix on Hendrix: Interviews and Encounters with Jimi Hendrix|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-61374-322-5|location=|pages=114|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayer|first=Harry Shapiro, Michael Heatley, Roger|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fpUuXZU9-1QC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=sue+records+jimi+hendrix+july+1965#v=onepage|title=Jimi Hendrix Gear|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=|isbn=978-1-61060-421-5|location=|pages=45|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMurray initially released his records in the UK through Decca's [[London Records]] but switched to a licensing deal with [[Island Records]] in [[1964 in music|1964]].<ref name=\":4\" /> This deal resulted in a split in the ownership of the Sue name. Island used the label to distribute Sue in the UK.  Problems began when Island also leased discs from other US labels that interested them and released them on UK Sue too - which was not in the agreement. Murray terminated the agreement and returned to Decca in 1966.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nAfter failing to chart in the U.S., Murray sold the Sue masters to [[United Artists Records]] in 1968. A reissue of the \"Harlem Shuffle\" by [[Bob & Earl]] made the Top 10 in Britain in 1969.<ref name=\":3\" /> Murray retained rights to the Sue name and constantly attempted to re-activate the label until his death in 2005. The Sue Records catalog eventually ended up with EMI, and then with Universal Music Group upon EMI's being bought out in 2012.\n\nEMI released a 4-CD box-set ''The Sue Records Story: The Sound of Soul'' in 1994, while [[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]] later released four volumes of ''The UK Sue Label Story.''\n\n==Discography==\nSue Records were best known for their R&B and Rock 'n' Roll singles but released a number of LPs between 1958 and 1966 featuring popular and jazz artists.<ref name =BSN>Edwards, D. & Callahan, M.

Sue's first hit record came in 1958 with \"Itchy Twitchy Feeling\" by [[Bobby Hendricks]] which peaked at #25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Success continued into the sixties with a handful of singles by R&B duo [[Ike & Tina Turner]] between 1960 and 1962. \"Mockingbird\" by brother-and-sister duo [[Inez and Charlie Foxx]] was a hit on the subsidiary label Symbol in 1963. Sue also had hits on the charts with \"Stick Shift\" by [[the Duals]], \"Hurt by Love\" by Inez Foxx and \"That's How Heartaches Are Made\" by [[Baby Washington|Justine \"Baby\" Washington]]. Sue also released early recordings by the soul singer [[Don Covay]] and albums by the [[Soul jazz|soul-jazz]] organist [[Jimmy McGriff]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] signed his first recording contract with Sue in 1965, but no recordings were released.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hendrix|first=Jimi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoVmCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Copa+Management+juggy+murray#v=onepage|title=Hendrix on Hendrix: Interviews and Encounters with Jimi Hendrix|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-61374-322-5|location=|pages=114|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayer|first=Harry Shapiro, Michael Heatley, Roger|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fpUuXZU9-1QC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=sue+records+jimi+hendrix+july+1965#v=onepage|title=Jimi Hendrix Gear|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=|isbn=978-1-61060-421-5|location=|pages=45|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMurray initially released his records in the UK through Decca's [[London Records]] but switched to a licensing deal with [[Island Records]] in [[1964 in music|1964]].<ref name=\":4\" /> This deal resulted in a split in the ownership of the Sue name. Island used the label to distribute Sue in the UK.  Problems began when Island also leased discs from other US labels that interested them and released them on UK Sue too - which was not in the agreement. Murray terminated the agreement and returned to Decca in 1966.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nAfter failing to chart in the U.S., Murray sold the Sue masters to [[United Artists Records]] in 1968. A reissue of the \"Harlem Shuffle\" by [[Bob & Earl]] made the Top 10 in Britain in 1969.<ref name=\":3\" /> Murray retained rights to the Sue name and constantly attempted to re-activate the label until his death in 2005. The Sue Records catalog eventually ended up with EMI, and then with Universal Music Group upon EMI's being bought out in 2012.\n\nEMI released a 4-CD box-set ''The Sue Records Story: The Sound of Soul'' in 1994, while [[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]] later released four volumes of ''The UK Sue Label Story.''\n\n==Discography==\nSue Records were best known for their R&B and Rock 'n' Roll singles but released a number of LPs between 1958 and 1966 featuring popular and jazz artists.<ref name =BSN>Edwards, D. & Callahan, M.
