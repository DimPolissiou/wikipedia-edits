Therefore, in the last decade a new campus has been built at [[Athi River]], some 40&nbsp;km to the south-east of the city, on the [[Mombasa]] Road which became the main campus.  This development has been largely as a result of work of the vice chancellor of Daystar, Professor S. Talitwala.\n\n==History==\nIn 1967, Dr. Donald K. Smith, an American missionary, and Motsoko Pheko, an African journalist, founded Daystar Communications.  Daystar sought to improve techniques used in communicating the message of Christ, to analyze the target audience of these messages, and to design more effective communication strategies for reaching such audiences.\n\nDaystar began short-term training programs in 1971 to assist church leaders in developing cross-cultural communication strategies.  Dr. Smith left Daystar in 1980 and since then Daystar University has been run by African leadership.  It now has an enrollment over more than 5,000 students in 32 undergraduate majors, 16 masters programs, and 2 PhD. programs.\n\nThe university continues to produce graduates who are serving in various capacities in Africa.\n(www.Daystar.ac.ke)   \n(www.DaystarUS.org)\n\n== Academics ==\nIt has six schools and fifteen academic departments which include\n\n'''School of Communication'''\n* Language and Performing Arts\n* Media and Film Studies\n* Strategi and Organizational Communication\n\n'''School of Arts and Humanities'''\n* Education\n* Theology and Biblical Studies\n* Peace and International Studies\n\n'''School of Science, Engineering and Health'''\n* Nursing\n* Computer Science\n* Pre-University\n\n'''School of Human and Social Sciences'''\n* Development Studies\n* Psychology and Counseling\n* Institute of Child Development\n\n'''School of Business and Economics'''\n* Commerce\n* Economics\n* Institute of Leadership and Professional Development\n\n'''School of Law'''\n* Media & Communication Law\n\n===Department of language and performing arts===\nThe Department of Language and Performing Arts, sometimes referred to as LPA Department houses degree programs and classes in music and in the literature and languages of Swahili, French and English.

Its head of department is Wandia Njoya.\n\nAt its creation in 2010, the department was challenged by low student interest and misleading information about the potential of the creative arts. The challenges included attacks on the arts as irrelevant to the Kenyan context and students receiving advice not to take programs offered by the department. These attacks were in line with the larger Kenyan education philosophy that sees the purpose of school as solely to prepare people for employment.\n\nThe department thus embarked on an aggressive campaign to increase its visibility in the university and to persuade students to enroll in its classes as electives, minors and majors. The department's strategy included\n\n* inviting writers, musicians, music producers and artists to speak to students about the doors opened by studying literature, language and music. The guests hosted include Kinyanjui Kombani, Dominic Khaemba, [[Suzanna Ow\u00edyo|Suzanna Owiyo]], [[Boniface Mwangi]], the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and Onduko Bwa'Atebe\n* teaching courses related to topical issues such as Hip Hop and African Political Thought and inviting members of the public to attend the classes\n* Inviting speakers to talk on topical issues such as elections and citizenship ([[Boniface Mwangi]]), the structure of Marginalization in Kenya (Adam Hussein), the Soul of Sex (Curtis Reed), and the Mau Mau Compensations (Muoki Mbunga)\n* holding a Creatives Academy workshop that connects students to writers, publishers and media personalities who share their experiences and insights on how one can make a living from writing, negotiate with publishers, and brand themselves and their work\n* increasing visibility and interaction through social media.

The arrival of the Crew Dragon will raise the station's crew size from three to five for several months. \"Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will go up as not just demonstration pilots for Demo-2, but they would actually become crew on-board the International Space Station for a period of months to do work, and they would continue to operate on the ISS\", Bridenstine said. \"And then when we're ready with the next Crew Dragon, they'll come home\".
