This drives her to become an app developer like Qi Feng. Yi Fen recruits her three best friends Yan Mao Tang nicknamed Mao Mao (Guo Shu Yao), Tian Ming Xian (Lyan Cheng) and Hao Mei (Huang Wei Ting) to help her develop her app \"Dream Life\" when she decides to enter the [[Capcom]] app developer contest.\n\nEach one of her friends have dreams of their own. Stubborn Mao Mao wants to be a flight attendant, free spirit Ming Xian wants to be a poet and  righteous Mei wants to be an economist to help the poor. However one year later when all four graduate from college, reality sets in when they enter the work force. Yi Fen is still holding onto her dreams to make her app \"Dream Life\" happen while struggling to make a living as a beverage delivery person and working as a receptionist at a driving school. Mao Mao is a life insurance salesman who faces pressure from her boss each day to meet her monthly sales quota and fend off perverted clients who sexually harasses while leading her on that they will buy life insurance from her. Ming Xian is a taxi driver but tells her riders that she's really a poet who is a part-time taxi driver. Mei is a teaching assistant for her former professor whom she has a crush on, at the university.\n\nYi Fen and Qi Feng meet again when he is at the driving school for lessons while she uses the student driver car to chase after her former roommate who swindled her and lied about helping her develop the \"Dream Life\" app. With encouraging words from Qi Feng at the scene, Yi Fen gains confidence and continues developing her app on her own. The three other friends reunite at their former professor's wedding. They reminisce about how happy they were in college. After realizing Yi Fen not attending the wedding because she has to hand in her app contest presentation, the three are touched that Yi Fen is still following her dreams and decide to go to the contest venue to support her.\n\nQi Feng who is head of research and development at Capcom Taiwan, has problems of his own when his boss refuses to green light the development of his phone game app while stringing him along that he will reassess the project. Qi Feng spills his frustration about the situation to his friend Ren Dao Yuan (Lego Lee), who is head of the customer service department at Capcom Taiwan. The next day Qi Feng encounters Yi Fen during a beverage delivery run and feels talent being wasted in a menial job, he refers her to Dao Yuan since there is an opening in his department.\n\nDao Yuan works long hours in a demanding job and lives a lonely life, moved to Taipei from Kaohsiung after graduating from college to search for his former girlfriend Mao Mao, that he lost touch with for six years. The two had tried to maintain a long-distance relationship before losing touch. He was in Kaohsiung during college and she moved to Taipei after her father died. The two had a petty fight about putting time aside for each other and both didn't bother to contact the other back. Thinking Dao Yuan doesn't care, Mao Mao moved and changed her contacts. When Dao Yuan went to Taipei to look for her it was already too late.<ref>[http://obsessionsofline.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/aimhigh14trailer/] \"Aim High\" trailers.

This drives her to become an app developer like Qi Feng. Yi Fen recruits her three best friends Yan Mao Tang nicknamed Mao Mao (Guo Shu Yao), Tian Ming Xian (Lyan Cheng) and Hao Mei (Huang Wei Ting) to help her develop her app \"Dream Life\" when she decides to enter the [[Capcom]] app developer contest.\n\nEach one of her friends have dreams of their own. Stubborn Mao Mao wants to be a flight attendant, free spirit Ming Xian wants to be a poet and  righteous Mei wants to be an economist to help the poor. However one year later when all four graduate from college, reality sets in when they enter the work force. Yi Fen is still holding onto her dreams to make her app \"Dream Life\" happen while struggling to make a living as a beverage delivery person and working as a receptionist at a driving school. Mao Mao is a life insurance salesman who faces pressure from her boss each day to meet her monthly sales quota and fend off perverted clients who sexually harasses while leading her on that they will buy life insurance from her. Ming Xian is a taxi driver but tells her riders that she's really a poet who is a part-time taxi driver. Mei is a teaching assistant for her former professor whom she has a crush on, at the university.\n\nYi Fen and Qi Feng meet again when he is at the driving school for lessons while she uses the student driver car to chase after her former roommate who swindled her and lied about helping her develop the \"Dream Life\" app. With encouraging words from Qi Feng at the scene, Yi Fen gains confidence and continues developing her app on her own. The three other friends reunite at their former professor's wedding. They reminisce about how happy they were in college. After realizing Yi Fen not attending the wedding because she has to hand in her app contest presentation, the three are touched that Yi Fen is still following her dreams and decide to go to the contest venue to support her.\n\nQi Feng who is head of research and development at Capcom Taiwan, has problems of his own when his boss refuses to green light the development of his phone game app while stringing him along that he will reassess the project. Qi Feng spills his frustration about the situation to his friend Ren Dao Yuan (Lego Lee), who is head of the customer service department at Capcom Taiwan. The next day Qi Feng encounters Yi Fen during a beverage delivery run and feels talent being wasted in a menial job, he refers her to Dao Yuan since there is an opening in his department.\n\nDao Yuan works long hours in a demanding job and lives a lonely life, moved to Taipei from Kaohsiung after graduating from college to search for his former girlfriend Mao Mao, that he lost touch with for six years. The two had tried to maintain a long distance relationship before losing touch. He was in Kaohsiung during college and she moved to Taipei after her father died. The two had a petty fight about putting time aside for each other and both didn't bother to contact the other back. Thinking Dao Yuan doesn't care, Mao Mao moved and changed her contacts. When Dao Yuan went to Taipei to look for her it was already too late.<ref>[http://obsessionsofline.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/aimhigh14trailer/] \"Aim High\" trailers.

Because Hagen is a mixed-breed, he is subject to a large \"[[mongrel]]\" fee imposed by the Hungarian government, which Lili's father is unwilling to pay, offering instead to buy Lili a purebred dog if only she will get rid of Hagen. Lili is angry that her father thinks Hagen can be so easily replaced, and the incident underscores the lack of understanding between father and daughter.\n\nFearful that her father will get rid of Hagen while she is away, Lili takes the dog to her music class, where his appearance causes chaos. The teacher threatens to kick Lili out of music class unless she takes the dog outside and remains in the class. Instead, Lili strikes out with Hagen into the city, but they are found by her father, who left work to look for them after the music teacher phoned him. Lili's father is embarrassed by the incident, and in his anger, he drives Hagen to the outskirts of the city and abandons him on the side of the road. Hagen chases after their car but is unable to follow them.\n\nHagen begins a lonely journey wandering the city. He eventually befriends a white dog after it saves him from an angry butcher. After spending the night with other street dogs, a dog catcher pursues Hagen and the other street dogs. After a long chase, Hagen avoids the dog catchers with the help of a homeless man. However, the man sells Hagen to a [[dog fighting]] ring, where he is chained, starved, and trained to kill. In his first fight, he kills his opponent and escapes. He is caught by animal control officers and brought to the city dog pound. \n\nMeanwhile Lili, still angry with her father and upset by the loss of Hagen, goes to a party where she drinks alcohol. The party is raided by the police, and Lili is taken to the station and her father called. Arriving to pick her up, her father breaks into tears and admits that he was wrong to get rid of Hagen and that while he does not understand the now-teenage Lili, he still loves her. The two reconcile and her father, in a gesture of getting reacquainted with his daughter, promises to attend her upcoming concert. \n\nOn the other side of the city, Hagen escapes from the pound after killing one of the staff. He breaks open the cages and frees the other dogs, who follow him into the city. With Hagen as their leader, the dogs start an uprising against their human oppressors, wreaking mayhem as Hagen locates and kills all the people who harmed him. The pack reaches the concert hall where Lili is playing, and the concert-goers barricade themselves within for safety. Spotting Hagen, Lili sneaks out of the concert hall and follows the dog pack on her bicycle.\n\nFollowed by his army, Hagen goes to the [[slaughterhouse]] where Lili's father works, where they appear on the verge of taking revenge on him when Lili arrives. At first, Hagen growls at Lili and has his army behind and around him. Her father rushes from the building armed with a blowtorch to defend his daughter, but instead, Lili plays [[Franz Liszt]]'s \"[[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2]]\" on her trumpet. Hagen seems to forgive her and lies down to listen. All the other dogs lie down in a gesture of reconciliation as Lili sits in their midst and continues to play. She then lies down facing Hagen. Her father, stunned at the scene, puts down his weapon and goes to lie down beside his daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* Zs\u00f3fia Psotta as Lili  \n* [[S\u00e1ndor Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r]] as D\u00e1niel  \n* Lili Horv\u00e1th as Elza  \n* Szabolcs Thur\u00f3czy as Old man  \n* [[Lili Monori]] as Bev\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00e1lffi]] as Music teacher\n* Gergely B\u00e1nki as Dog-catcher  \n* Tam\u00e1s Polg\u00e1r as Dog-catcher\n* Bodie and Luke as Hagen the dog\n\n==Animal welfare during filming==\n\nApproximately 250 dogs were used in the film.

He notes that, \"The ancient world cared little about the subject; it was a backwater of Jewish and Christian teaching about sexuality. In fact, solitary sex as a serious moral issue can be dated with a precision rare in cultural history; Laqueur identifies it with the publication of the anonymous tract Onania in about 1722. Masturbation is a creation of the Enlightenment, of some of its most important figures, and of the most profound changes it unleashed. It is modern. It worried at first not conservatives, but progressives. It was the first truly democratic sexuality that could be of ethical interest for women as much as for men, for boys and girls as much as for their elders.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas Walter|title=Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pDOLAAAAIAAJ&q=aurelie+godefroy+protestantes+masturbation&dq=aurelie+godefroy+protestantes+masturbation|accessdate=29 April 2018|date=2003|publisher=Zone Books|isbn=9781890951337}}</ref>\n\nThis is because Laqueur claims that masturbation \"could only be named as such when the 'self' emerged as an autonomous being.\"<ref name=\"Krondorfer 2009\"/>\n\nGiovanni Cappelli, as quoted by [[James F. Keenan]], argues that as monastic communities developed, the sexual lives of monks came under scrutiny from two theologians, [[John Cassian]] (365\u2013433) and [[Caesarius of Arles]] (470\u2013543), who commented on the \"vices\" of the 'solitary' life. Cappelli claims that \"their concerns were not with the act of masturbation, but with the monks who vowed chastity. The monks' promise made masturbation an illicit act; the act itself was not considered sinful.\" Keenan adds: \"In fact, as Cappelli, Louis Crompton, and James Brundage each observe, prior to Cassian, masturbation was not considered a sexual offence for anyone.\"<ref name=\"Keenan2010\">{{cite book|author=James F.

Cassian considers \"nocturnal emission\" a very important problem as it is an indication of \"carnal [[lust]]\" and, if a monk still has not overcome it, \"his religious life and his salvation might well be in peril\".<ref name=\"Brundage2009_p109\"/> In the ''Conlationes'', Cassian uses the word \"uncleanness\" (''immunditia'', as written in Collossians 3:5) as an equal substitute for both masturbation and nocturnal emissions, obviously regards masturbation as an unacceptable form of \"sexual release\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Columba|author-link=Columba Stewart|title=Cassian the Monk|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195354355|pages=67,185}}</ref> In the ''De institutis coenobiorum'', he gives particular emphasis on \"the sin of fornication, which includes masturbation and sexual fantasising\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Christopher J.|title=The Idea of Luxury: A Conceptual and Historical Investigation|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521466912|page=97}}</ref> Brundage sees Caesarius holds similar view as Cassian. In his ''Sermons'', Caesarius considers \"any sexual longing, to say nothing of deliberate self-stimulation, a serious sin and placed it on an even footing with adultery or excessive indulgence in sex by married persons\".<ref name=\"Brundage2009_p109\"/>\n\nIt is known that, prior to the sixth century, the Church's teachings on masturbation and many other moral issues were incoherent. Catholic researchers such as Bernard Hoose and Mark Jordan have found that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are \"simply not true\". Not only was there \"inconsistency, contradiction and even incoherence\" in the Church's doctrines  but the researchers' work has led to the insight that the [[Sacred tradition|tradition]] itself is \"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\"<ref name=\"Keenan2010\"/>\n\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or Orthodox Christian Church views sexuality as a gift from God that finds its fulfillment in the marital relationship, and therefore the misuse of the gift of human sexuality is sinful. Because the act of masturbation is self-directed, and by its nature is incapable of expressing love and concern for another person, it is viewed as a distortion of the use of the gift of sexuality. This is especially apparent when masturbation becomes an addiction. In the least, the practice of self-pleasure is viewed as not honoring the purpose of God's gift of sexuality.<ref>{{cite web\n  | author =John Matusiak \n  | title =Church's view of masturbation\n  | website =\n  | publisher =Orthodox Church in America\n  | url =http://oca.org/QA.asp?ID=230&SID=3\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-26 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe sexual sins of [[fornication]], [[adultery]] and masturbation, as well as hatred, jealousy, drunkenness and other sins are considered to be sins of the heart as much as the body. It is thought that turning away from sexual sin is turning away from self-indulgence for the purpose of self gratification. Instead of turning to the desires of the flesh, the Orthodox Christian turns to the [[Holy Spirit]], whose fruit is believed to be love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.<ref>{{cite web\n  | author =Archpriest Joseph F Purpura, Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese\n  | title =Pre-marital Sexual Relations\n  | website =Moral and Ethical Issues: Confronting Orthodox Youth across North America\n  | publisher =Author Books and Barnes & Noble\n  | url =http://www.antiochian.org/pre-marital_sexual_relations\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-26}}\n</ref>\n\nTalking about the Egyptian [[Gnostics]] related to his previous experience with them, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (310/320 \u2013 403), a Byzantine Church Father and [[Doctor of the Church]], states in his ''[[Panarion]]'', or ''Medicine Chest'': \n<blockquote>They exercise genital acts, yet prevent the conceiving of children.

They deduced, however that it was worth teaching a few young penitents how to masturbate in order to save the greater number who were already masturbating without confessing to it.\" She notes that, according to Gerson's book, \"Even once the penitent has admitted his sin the priest is not to be satisfied, and is to ask for further details...Particularly remarkable are the instructions that the priest feign a certain casualness, and that he address the confessant with a disarming affection, calling him \"friend\" and pretending that masturbation is neither sinful nor shameful in order to make the penitent admit to it, insinuating that he can relate to the penitent's acts\u2014\"Friend, I well believe it\"\u2014only to then backtrack and condemn the act as sinful and shameful after all.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2010\"/>\n\nThe laity did not undertake regular confession at this time but, \"For those such as the ordained and the scrupulous who did undergo frequent and rigorous confessional examination, the obligation to confess in circumstances such as Gerson describes for even the most routine and private of sins such as masturbation came to cause anxiety...Early medieval penance was only for grave sins, but now the most mundane of sins could be given excruciating attention.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2010\"/>\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church accused [[Catharism|Albigensians]] of masturbation as part of their propaganda campaign against them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fudge|first=Thomas A.|title=The Trial of Jan Hus: Medieval Heresy and Criminal Procedure|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2Ku4FJBMeKgC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=jan+hus+masturbation#v=onepage&q=jan%20hus%20masturbation&f=false|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0199988082|date=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\nBrundage notes that medieval \"penitentials occasionally mentioned female autoeroticism and lesbianism.

For St. Paul is not speaking of secret matters, but of the common, known feeling of all those who live chastely outside of marriage but do not have the grace to accomplish it. For he ascribes this flaming with passion to all who live chastely but without the necessary grace, and prescribes no other medicine than marriage. If it were no so common or if there were none other advice to be given, he would not have recommended marriage. This thing is known in German as \u201cthe secret disease,\u201d but this expression would not be so common either if the ailment were truly rare...There can also be no doubt that those who have the grace of chastity still at times feel evil desires and are tempted. But it is transitory, therefore their problem is not this burning. In short, \u201caflame with passion\u201d is the heat of the flesh, which rages without ceasing, and daily attraction to woman or to man; we find this wherever there is not desire and love for chastity. People without this heat are just as few and far between as are those who have God's grace for chastity. Now such heat is stronger in some, and weaker in others. Some among them suffer so severely that they masturbate. All these ought to be in the married estate...If they relieve themselves outside of marriage, then the pangs of conscience are soon there, and this is the most unbearable torment and the most miserable of earthly estates. This is the unavoidable result, that most of those who live without marriage and without grace in celibacy are forced to sin bodily in unchastity, and the others are forced to outward chastity and inward unchastity. The former must needs lead a damnable life, the latter an unholy useless one. And where are the spiritual and secular rulers who consider the plight of these poor souls? Every day they are helping the devil to increase this misery with their pressures and compulsion.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luther|first1=Martin|title=Commentaries on 1 Corinthians 7, 1 Corinthians 15, Lectures on 1 Timothy (Luther's Works, Vol. 28)|isbn=978-0-570-06428-2|pages=25\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn his writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3\u20135 (\"It is God\u2019s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;\"), Luther advises that, \"All young people should...resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word...If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying!

The impetus to this pleasure is called carnal lust (or also simply lust). The vice engendered through it is called lewdness; the virtue with regard to this sensuous impulse is called chastity, which is to be represented here as a duty of the human being to himself. Lust is called unnatural if one is aroused to it not by a real object but by his imagining it, so that he himself creates one, contrary to [natural] purpose; for in this way imagination brings forth a desire contrary to nature's end, and indeed to an end even more important than that of love of life itself, since it aims at the preservation of the whole species and not only of the individual. That such an unnatural use (and so misuse) of one's sexual attribute is a violation of duty to oneself, and indeed one contrary to morality in its highest degree, occurs to everyone immediately, with the thought of it, and stirs up an aversion to this thought to such an extent that it is considered indecent even to call this vice by its proper name. But it is not so easy to produce a rational proof that unnatural, and even merely unpurposive, use of one's sexual attribute is inadmissible as being a violation of duty to oneself (and indeed, as far as its unnatural use is concerned, a violation in the highest degree). \u2014 The ground of proof is, indeed, that by it man surrenders his personality (throwing it away), since he uses himself merely as a means to satisfy an animal impulse. But this does not explain the high degree of violation of the humanity in one's own person by such a vice in its unnaturalness, which seems in terms of its form (the disposition it involves) to exceed even murdering oneself. It consists, then, in this...unnatural lust, makes man not only an object of enjoyment but, still further, a thing that is contrary to nature, that is, a loathsome object, and so deprives him of all respect for himself.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|title=Kant: The Metaphysics of Morals|date=1797|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GcEmAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&lpg=PT163&dq=The+ground+of+proof+is,+indeed,+that+by+it+a+man+surrenders+his+personality+(throwing+it+away),+since+he+uses+himself+as+a+means+to+satisfy+an+animal+impulse.+But+this+does+not+explain+the+high+degree+of+violation+of+the+humanity+in+one%27s+own+person+by+such#v=onepage&q=The%20ground%20of%20proof%20is%2C%20indeed%2C%20that%20by%20it%20a%20man%20surrenders%20his%20personality%20(throwing%20it%20away)%2C%20since%20he%20uses%20himself%20as%20a%20means%20to%20satisfy%20an%20animal%20impulse.%20But%20this%20does%20not%20explain%20the%20high%20degree%20of%20violation%20of%20the%20humanity%20in%20one's%20own%20person%20by%20such&f=false|isbn=9781107268487}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]] period, there were Protestant societies for moral purity that opposed masturbation. In the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer era]], there was very strict sexual morality in the Church. However, at the end of the  1960s, Protestant theologians set about redefining human sexuality. [[Siegfried Keil]] emerged as a leading figure in this movement but even he continued to oppose masturbation, seeing it as  immoral. However, in 1971, the Church published its \"Denkschrift zu Fragen der Sexualethik\" (\"Memorandum on Issues of Sexual Ethics\"), which took an extremely liberal position on masturbation. Sexologist [[Volkmar Sigusch]] claimed the positions in the memorandum read like they could have been written by liberal sex education teachers, rather than by pastors and theologians. Despite this liberalization, there was a growing alienation between the Church and faithful in the 1970s as people no longer turned to the church for advice on sexual morality but to doctors and sexual magazines. This was a dramatic shift from the 1950s, when the Churches had dominated the field of public and private morality in Germany.

When Paul speaks about impurity and sexual greed as idolatry in Ephesians 5:3-7 and Colossians 3:5, he accurately describes how it works. It begins with sexual impurity, the defilement of our imagination by depictions of sexual intercourse that present naked bodies as idols for us to admire. Our fixation on these images arouses disordered desires and make us more and more greedy for sexual satisfaction from things that God has not given to us for our enjoyment. Yet they fail to satisfy us and serve only to feed our growing appetite for them...Where masturbation is involved...the more ashamed we become, the more secretive we become; the more secretive we become and the more we hide in the darkness, the more vulnerable we become to the accusation and condemnation of Satan...You need to be careful that Satan does not distort your perception by making a fool of you and getting you to focus on the wrong thing. Nowhere in the Bible is masturbation explicitly forbidden. There is good reason for this because the problem does not come from masturbation, which is in itself neither good or bad, but the adulterous sexual fantasies that accompany it, as Christ makes clear in Matthew 5:28. That\u2019s the problem spiritually!...That\u2019s how Satan gets a hold on us through our imagination. If you use pornography to masturbate, you put another woman, an idol that promises heaven and gives you hell, sexually, in the place of your wife. It arouses your greed for what you don\u2019t have, greed for what God has not given for you to enjoy, greed that increases as you give in to it.

A. van Ginkel stated, when asked if it was sinful to masturbate if you are unmarried and you are fantasising about an unmarried girl, \"What is all-important is that you see your body as not of yourself. Your life belongs to the Lord! Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. God hates uncleanness. That may sound harsh, but God's Word speaks clearly when it comes to that. It would be best if you could project your desire in sincere love and faithfulness to her that God gives you!...But there's a problem there. You do not have her. You are not married. And maybe you do not want a woman out of God's hand at all!? You want to project your sexual fantasy on an unmarried woman. In your mind \"do it\" with her. Focused on yourself. However understandable, this is not a good solution...You seek biblical legitimacy and believe it to be in the fact that the Bible does not speak about self-gratification. (The passage about the sin of Onan does indeed have nothing to do with self-gratification.) But the Bible does speak out about a holy and God-focused life. Paul writes to the church in Corinth: All that you do, do it to the glory of God. Thinking of this Word alone, you have no biblical legitimacy for your sexual projections. Pray for God on your side, with whom you may live life to the honor of His Name. This includes your sexual life! This is desirable!\"<ref>http://www.refoweb.nl/vragenrubriek/23197/masturberen-en-fantaseren/</ref>\n\nThe American conservative Calvinist website, Reformed Answers, argues that masturbation is only sin if it entails lustful fantasies for someone other than the person's spouse: \"...if an act of masturbation expresses the sin of lust, then that act of masturbation can be condemned as sinful. But this argument cannot condemn acts of masturbation that do not give expression to the sin of lust.\" The site notes that masturbation can only be opposed on moral grounds, not natural ones: \"Some argue that masturbation is wrong on the basis of nature. That is, in a fashion similar to the argument based on Onan's sin, they argue that God did not design the human body and reproductive system to work in this manner, that God's general revelation in nature condemns the practice. This is a tenuous argument at best. In fact, there is some evidence to the contrary. For example, many human beings learn to masturbate without ever having been taught it or having heard about it. It would seem to be their \"natural\" impulse. Moreover, human beings are naturally equipped with the necessary body parts to accomplish masturbation (unlike most animals). It could be argued on these bases that it is natural. Moreover, most Protestants reject the idea that what is natural is necessarily what is good\u2014especially in light of our \"sin nature.\" This is simply a poor ground on which to base the argument against masturbation.\"<ref>http://reformedanswers.org/answer.asp/file/40098</ref>\n\nThe American Reformed author [[Jay E.

When masturbation grows out of a sense of this need for physical release due to unclean thoughts, it is sin.

Satan has conveniently disguised this \u201cawful\u201d topic as something that ought not to be mentioned, and never to be preached. The church's response to this is a deafening silence...The topic of lust may sometimes be alluded to, but never developed into the precise \u201cdoctrine\u201d of the Bible's teaching on lust and masturbation, which really develops into a study on the fruit of the Spirit (love to Christ more than \u201cself\u201d, and self-control)...Since we are in desperate need for Biblical teaching on this subject, we turn to the church to teach us what it means to be sexually pure.

They note that \"The Bible presents no clear theological ethic on masturbation...Of the many aspects of human sexuality that we address in our work, masturbation ranks as the most misunderstood for the lack of open, rational dialogue about this topic within the Christian community...Within evangelical frameworks of sexual ethics...there has never been a well-defined theological ethic of masturbation, in contrast to the ethics of pre-marital sex, marriage, and divorce that are worked out from foundational Christian anthropological assertions about gender, sexuality, and their relationship to the imago Dei...Masturbation falls thus within the proverbial grey area of evangelical sexual ethics.\"<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nThey go on to note that \"we find that the questions that Christian young people ask about masturbation can be reduced to two essential queries.

Modern readers of course understand Onan's act not as masturbation but as coitus interuptus. The technical designation of the act, however, is unimportant compared to the ethical violations manifesting through the act. The interpretive context for Genesis 38:6-10 is found in the ancient Israelite law (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)...Whatever his reasons for not consummating intercourse, Onan was punished for violating a specific Hebrew law and for failing in his covenantal duty to his deceased brother.

He notes that Onan's sin was about failing to do his duty under the Levirate law mentioned in Deu 25:5-6. Under this law it was \"the closest brother's duty to ensure that his family survived by marrying the widow. When Onan \"spilled his seed on the earth,\" it means that he refused to get a seed to his brother and instead utilized his brother's widow for his own sexual pleasure.\" He goes on to note that  another text which is sometimes invoked is Matthew 5:27-30. Here, he says, Jesus is simply warning that it is not only wrong to cheat in one's action but also that it is wrong to cheat in one's heart. Therefore a person should not look with lustful intent at someone else's wife. He says these texts are not about masturbation and that the Bible does not explicitly mention that masturbation is a sin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianmolk.se/2011/09/vad-sager-bibeln-om-onani/|title=Vad s\u00e4ger Bibeln om onani?|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother Swedish Pentecostal, [[Christer \u00c5berg]], has written about the practice on a Welsh language  site.

The answer is \"no.\" But it can lead to sin, so, therefore, I think one should be careful with it. I mean if a guy masturbates and fantasizes with  desire for a girl, it will be wrong...It's really like everything: It's not a sin to drink alcohol, but it can lead to sin if you drink yourself drunk. Nor is it a sin to dance, but it can lead to sin, etc., etc. The Bible says that \"Everything is legal to me, but not everything is beneficial.

I wrote that it was not too bad to masturbate, but it could lead to sin. Maybe the best advice in today's society is to help with masturbation. I think of an article in the Expressen newspaper about a \"masturbation competition\". This is a clear example that it can open you up to an evil influence, and lead you to sin.

Masturbation is practiced far more than adultery or fornication, yet God is practically silent on the issue.

Just like most things, masturbation can turn into an addiction...Paul said, \"'Everything is permissible for me'\u2014but I will not be mastered by anything\" (1 Cor 6:12).

Their prohibition is taken to follow from the central teaching that the purpose of sex is the creation of legitimate offspring...For several reasons, Friends are likely to feel uncomfortable with this pronatalist framing of the morality of intimate relationships.\nFor many Friends, the most serious objection of all...would be pronatalism's steadfast focus on increasing the population.

Within that context, masturbation qualifies to be called a sin...Finally, as with every other sin, masturbation leads to spiritual weakness and loss of intimacy with God.\"<ref>http://ekklesiamag.com/2018/01/23/15-faq-about-sex/</ref>\n\n====Restorationism====\n\n===== Jehovah's Witnesses =====\nThe [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] teach that masturbation is a habit that is a \"form of uncleanness\", one that \"fosters attitudes that can be mentally corrupting\".<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Awake!|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006407|date=November 2006|pages=18&ndash;20|title=How Can I Conquer This Habit?}}</ref>\n\n===== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints =====\n{{main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and masturbation}}\n\nOn many occasions spanning over a century, leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) have taught that adherents should not [[masturbation|masturbate]] as part of obedience to the code of conduct known as the [[law of chastity]].<ref name=\"Historical\">{{cite journal|last1=Malan|first1=Mark Kim|last2=Bullough|first2=Vern|title=Historical development of new masturbation attitudes in Mormon culture: Silence, secular conformity, counterrevolution, and emerging reform|journal=Sexuality and Culture|date=December 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=80\u2013127|doi=10.1007/s12119-005-1003-z|citeseerx=10.1.1.597.8039}}</ref>{{rp|80\u2013127}}<ref name=\"lds92\">{{Citation|title=Understanding and Helping Those Who Have Homosexual Problems: Suggestions for Ecclesiastical Leaders|year=1992|place=Salt Lake City, Utah|publisher=LDS Church}}.

White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], in the mid-19th century said she had spiritual visions from God that gave her guidance on the Christian life.  She warned against overly-stimulating foods, sex, and masturbation, which she referred to as \"solitary vice.\"  She warned her followers of her visions of disfigured humans and the consequences of masturbation not only destroying one's life, but preventing access to Heaven when Jesus comes in the first resurrection. She said that masturbation was the cause of many sicknesses in adults from cancer to lung disease.  White even stated that masturbation claimed many sinners' lives prematurely. She believed that one's diet had a direct correlation with one's urge to masturbate. She said that a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, wheat breads, and water would lead to a diminished urge to masturbate and thus would lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life. To ultimately produce a guide for future generations she said solitary vice was the cause of hereditary insanity, cancer, and other deadly diseases; clearly appealing to parents to protect their children by not engaging in solitary vice.<ref>Numbers, Ronald L, \"Sex, Science, and Salvation: The Sexual Advice of Ellen G.

This law is derived from the story of Onan (Gen. 38:8-10), who practiced coitus interruptus as a means of birth control to avoid fathering a child for his deceased brother. G-d killed Onan for this sin. Although Onan's act was not truly masturbation, Jewish law takes a very broad view of the acts prohibited by this passage, and forbids any act of ha-sh'cha'tat zerah (destruction of the seed), that is, ejaculation outside of the vagina. In fact, the prohibition is so strict that one passage in the Talmud states, \"in the case of a man, the hand that reaches below the navel should be chopped off.\" (Niddah 13a). The issue is somewhat less clear for women. Obviously, spilling the seed is not going to happen in female masturbation, and there is no explicit Torah prohibition against female masturbation. Nevertheless, Judaism generally frowns upon female masturbation as \"impure thoughts.\"</ref> By virtue of Onan, traditional Judaism condemns [male] masturbation.<ref name=myjewishlearning>Maimonides, ''Commentary to the Mishnah, Sanhedrin'' 7:4, apud {{cite book|last1=Dorff|first1=Elliot N.|author-link1=Elliot N.

Apart from a person who has taken vow of Brahmacharya, Hindus are free to engage in sexual activities. However, this is only within the limits of heterosexual marriage. According to Hinduism, life begins at the Brahmacharya in which they are directed to chastely advance themselves educationally and spiritually to prepare themselves for a life of furthering their dharma and karma ; only once they reach the Grihastya or \"householder\" stage, which begins with marriage, can they seek kama and artha through their vocations.\n\n== Buddhism ==\n{{see also|Buddhist ethics|karma|Ta\u1e47h\u0101|Vinaya}}\nThe most used formulation of Buddhist ethics are the [[Five Precepts]]. These precepts take the form of voluntary personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third precept is \"to refrain from committing sexual misconduct\".<ref name=HIGG>{{cite web | last =Higgins | first =Winton | title =Buddhist Sexual Ethics | publisher =BuddhaNet Magazine | url =http://www.buddhanet.net/winton_s.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref> However, different [[schools of Buddhism]] have differing interpretations of what constitutes sexual misconduct.\n\nBuddhism was advanced by [[Gautama Buddha]] as a method by which human beings could end [[dukkha]] (suffering) and escape [[samsara]] (cyclic existence). Normally this entails practicing [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and following the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] as a way to subdue the passions which, along with the [[skandha]]s, cause suffering and rebirth. Masturbation ([[Pali]]: ''sukkavissa\u1e6d\u1e6dhi'') is accordingly seen as problematic for a person who wishes to attain liberation. According to a lecture by Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, it is important to abstain from \"sexual intercourse, including masturbation, any action that brings an orgasm and so forth, because this results in a rebirth.\"<ref name=thubten>{{cite web|title=Kopan Course No. 03 & No. 04 (1972-73): Appendix One: The Eight Mahayana Precepts|author=Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&id=236&chid=381|access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>  He clarifies: \"Generally, the action that is the opposite of the precept brings the opposite negative result, takes us further from enlightenment, and keeps us longer in samsara.\"<ref name=thubten />\n\nShravasti Dhammika, a [[bhikkhu|Theravadin monk]], cites the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'' in his online \"Guide to Buddhism A to Z\", and states the following:\n{{quote|Masturbation (''sukkavissa\u1e6d\u1e6dhi'') is the act of stimulating one's own sexual organs (''samb\u0101dha'') to the stage of orgasm (''adhikavega''). In the ''[[Kama Sutra|K\u0101ma S\u016btra]]'' male masturbation is called \"seizing the lion\" (''si\u1e43h\u0101k\u0101ranta''). Some people during the Buddha's time believed that masturbation could have a therapeutic effect on the mind and the body (Vin. III, 109), although the Buddha disagreed with this. According to the Vinaya, it is an offence of some seriousness for monks or nuns to masturbate (Vin. III, 111) although the Buddha gave no guidance on this matter to lay people. However, Buddhism could agree with contemporary medical opinion that masturbation is a normal expression of the sexual drive and is physically and psychologically harmless, as long as it does not become a preoccupation or a substitute for ordinary sexual relations. Guilt and self-disgust about masturbating is certainly more harmful than masturbation itself.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Shravasti Dhammika|authorlink1=Shravasti Dhammika|title=Masturbation|url=http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=249|website=Guide to Buddhism A-Z|publisher=Bhante Dhammika|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nHis opinions regarding non-Buddhists notwithstanding, the Buddha did encourage his serious disciples to limit their sexual behaviour or to embrace celibacy.<ref>{{cite web|author1=M.

Not only are monastics [[celibacy|celibate]], but they also take more and stricter vows in order to conquer their desires. In the Theravadin tradition, masturbation is also stressed as being harmful for [[Up\u0101saka and Up\u0101sik\u0101|up\u0101sakas and up\u0101sik\u0101s]] (lay devotees) who practice the Eight Precepts on [[Uposatha]] days, leading a more ascetic lifestyle that does not allow for masturbation. Indeed, masturbation is explicitly characterised as sexual misconduct in the ''Up\u0101saka\u015b\u012bla s\u016btra'':\n{{quote|\"If sex is practised under the inappropriate times (times not allowed by precepts), [at] inappropriate place[s] (places not allowed by precepts),  with non-female[s], with virgin[s], with a married wife, if sex relates to self-body, it is known as sexual misconduct.\"<ref>S\u016btra of the Up\u0101saka Precepts, fascicle 6, Chapter 24a</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, some contemporary writers on Buddhism suggest that masturbation is essentially harmless for a layperson.<ref>{{cite web|title=\t A Sensitive Topic|website=Daily Buddhism|author1=Brian Schell|date=January 8, 2009|access-date=January 9, 2017|url=http://www.dailybuddhism.com/archives/1081}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Beliefnet.com|title=Masturbation: Does Your Religion Give It a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down?|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Love-Family/2001/07/Masturbation-Does-Your-Religion-Give-It-A-Thumbs-Up-Or-Thumbs-Down.aspx|access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Taoism ==\nSome teachers and practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], Taoist [[Meditation#Taoism|meditative]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] say that masturbation can cause a lowered energy level in men.  They say that ejaculation in this way reduces \"origin [[qi]]\" from [[dantian]], the energy center located in the lower abdomen.  Some maintain that sex with a partner does not do this because the partners replenish each other's qi. Some practitioners therefore say that males should not practice martial arts for at least 48 hours after masturbation while others prescribe up to six months, because the loss of Origin Qi does not allow new qi to be [[Qigong|created]] for this kind of time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n \nSome Taoists strongly discouraged female masturbation. Women were encouraged to practice massaging techniques upon themselves, but were also instructed to avoid thinking sexual thoughts if experiencing a feeling of pleasure. Otherwise, the woman's \"labia will open wide and the sexual secretions will flow.\" If this happened, the woman would lose part of her life force, and this could bring illness and shortened life.<ref>Wile (1994), p. 59.</ref>\n\n== Zoroastrianism ==\nThe act of masturbation is known as '''Shoeythra Gunaah''', or '''Shoithra-gunah''', which can also be used to refer to [[onanism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zoroastriansnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/therationaleofpatet.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Zoroastrian holy book ''[[Avesta]]'', with its stress on physical cleanliness, lists voluntary masturbation among the unpardonable sins that one can commit.

By the waste of muscular tissue he is hardly able to undergo the exertion required for the discharge of his daily duties. But it is the nervous tissue that suffers most, inasmuch as his memory fails, his intellect becomes dull, he becomes morose and peevish, and shuns the agreeable society of his friends and relatives, and consequently he becomes subject to melancholia. His mind soon becomes exhausted after slight application and its power of retaining impressions is lost. If he becomes subject to melancholia, he sometimes attempts to commit suicide. When we consider these evil effects following masturbation, we do not wonder why it is considered an inexpiable crime.<ref name=\"Dubash1906\">{{cite book|last=Dubash|first=Sorabji Edalji|title=The Zoroastrian Sanitary Code, with Critical and Explanatory Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZAcvgAACAAJ|series=K.R.

It was the first truly democratic sexuality that could be of ethical interest for women as much as for men, for boys and girls as much as for their elders.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas Walter|title=Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pDOLAAAAIAAJ&q=aurelie+godefroy+protestantes+masturbation&dq=aurelie+godefroy+protestantes+masturbation|accessdate=29 April 2018|date=2003|publisher=Zone Books|isbn=9781890951337}}</ref>\n\nThis is because Laqueur claims that masturbation \"could only be named as such when the 'self' emerged as an autonomous being.\"<ref name=\"Krondorfer 2009\"/>\n\nGiovanni Cappelli, as quoted by [[James F. Keenan]], argues that as monastic communities developed, the sexual lives of monks came under scrutiny from two theologians, [[John Cassian]] (365\u2013433) and [[Caesarius of Arles]] (470\u2013543), who commented on the \"vices\" of the 'solitary' life. Cappelli claims that \"their concerns were not with the act of masturbation, but with the monks who vowed chastity. The monks' promise made masturbation an illicit act; the act itself was not considered sinful.\" Keenan adds: \"In fact, as Cappelli, Louis Crompton, and James Brundage each observe, prior to Cassian, masturbation was not considered a sexual offence for anyone.\"<ref name=\"Keenan2010\">{{cite book|author=James F.

Cassian considers \"nocturnal emission\" a very important problem as it is an indication of \"carnal [[lust]]\" and, if a monk still has not overcome it, \"his religious life and his salvation might well be in peril\".<ref name=\"Brundage2009_p109\"/> In the ''Conlationes'', Cassian uses the word \"uncleanness\" (''immunditia'', as written in Collossians 3:5) as an equal substitute for both masturbation and nocturnal emissions, obviously regards masturbation as an unacceptable form of \"sexual release\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Columba|author-link=Columba Stewart|title=Cassian the Monk|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195354355|pages=67,185}}</ref> In the ''De institutis coenobiorum'', he gives particular emphasis on \"the sin of fornication, which includes masturbation and sexual fantasising\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Christopher J.|title=The Idea of Luxury: A Conceptual and Historical Investigation|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521466912|page=97}}</ref> Brundage sees Caesarius holds similar view as Cassian. In his ''Sermons'', Caesarius considers \"any sexual longing, to say nothing of deliberate self-stimulation, a serious sin and placed it on an even footing with adultery or excessive indulgence in sex by married persons\".<ref name=\"Brundage2009_p109\"/>\n\nIt is known that, prior to the sixth century, the Church's teachings on masturbation and many other moral issues were incoherent. Catholic researchers such as Bernard Hoose and Mark Jordan have found that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are \"simply not true\". Not only was there \"inconsistency, contradiction and even incoherence\" in the Church's doctrines  but the researchers' work has led to the insight that the [[Sacred tradition|tradition]] itself is \"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\"<ref name=\"Keenan2010\"/>\n\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or Orthodox Christian Church views sexuality as a gift from God that finds its fulfillment in the marital relationship, and therefore the misuse of the gift of human sexuality is sinful. Because the act of masturbation is self-directed, and by its nature is incapable of expressing love and concern for another person, it is viewed as a distortion of the use of the gift of sexuality. This is especially apparent when masturbation becomes an addiction. In the least, the practice of self-pleasure is viewed as not honoring the purpose of God's gift of sexuality.<ref>{{cite web\n  | author =John Matusiak \n  | title =Church's view of masturbation\n  | website =\n  | publisher =Orthodox Church in America\n  | url =http://oca.org/QA.asp?ID=230&SID=3\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-26 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe sexual sins of [[fornication]], [[adultery]] and masturbation, as well as hatred, jealousy, drunkenness and other sins are considered to be sins of the heart as much as the body. It is thought that turning away from sexual sin is turning away from self-indulgence for the purpose of self gratification. Instead of turning to the desires of the flesh, the Orthodox Christian turns to the [[Holy Spirit]], whose fruit is believed to be love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.<ref>{{cite web\n  | author =Archpriest Joseph F Purpura, Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese\n  | title =Pre-marital Sexual Relations\n  | website =Moral and Ethical Issues: Confronting Orthodox Youth across North America\n  | publisher =Author Books and Barnes & Noble\n  | url =http://www.antiochian.org/pre-marital_sexual_relations\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-26}}\n</ref>\n\nTalking about the Egyptian [[Gnostics]] related to his previous experience with them, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (310/320 \u2013 403), a Byzantine Church Father and [[Doctor of the Church]], states in his ''[[Panarion]]'', or ''Medicine Chest'': \n<blockquote>They exercise genital acts, yet prevent the conceiving of children.

For St. Paul is not speaking of secret matters, but of the common, known feeling of all those who live chastely outside of marriage but do not have the grace to accomplish it. For he ascribes this flaming with passion to all who live chastely but without the necessary grace, and prescribes no other medicine than marriage. If it were no so common or if there were none other advice to be given, he would not have recommended marriage. This thing is known in German as \u201cthe secret disease,\u201d but this expression would not be so common either if the ailment were truly rare...There can also be no doubt that those who have the grace of chastity still at times feel evil desires and are tempted. But it is transitory, therefore their problem is not this burning. In short, \u201caflame with passion\u201d is the heat of the flesh, which rages without ceasing, and daily attraction to woman or to man; we find this wherever there is not desire and love for chastity. People without this heat are just as few and far between as are those who have God's grace for chastity. Now such heat is stronger in some, and weaker in others. Some among them suffer so severely that they masturbate. All these ought to be in the married estate...If they relieve themselves outside of marriage, then the pangs of conscience are soon there, and this is the most unbearable torment and the most miserable of earthly estates. This is the unavoidable result, that most of those who live without marriage and without grace in celibacy are forced to sin bodily in unchastity, and the others are forced to outward chastity and inward unchastity. The former must needs lead a damnable life, the latter an unholy useless one. And where are the spiritual and secular rulers who consider the plight of these poor souls? Every day they are helping the devil to increase this misery with their pressures and compulsion.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luther|first1=Martin|title=Commentaries on 1 Corinthians 7, 1 Corinthians 15, Lectures on 1 Timothy (Luther's Works, Vol. 28)|isbn=978-0-570-06428-2|pages=25\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn his writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3\u20135 (\"It is God\u2019s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;\"), Luther advises that, \"All young people should...resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word...If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying!

The impetus to this pleasure is called carnal lust (or also simply lust). The vice engendered through it is called lewdness; the virtue with regard to this sensuous impulse is called chastity, which is to be represented here as a duty of the human being to himself. Lust is called unnatural if one is aroused to it not by a real object but by his imagining it, so that he himself creates one, contrary to [natural] purpose; for in this way imagination brings forth a desire contrary to nature's end, and indeed to an end even more important than that of love of life itself, since it aims at the preservation of the whole species and not only of the individual. That such an unnatural use (and so misuse) of one's sexual attribute is a violation of duty to oneself, and indeed one contrary to morality in its highest degree, occurs to everyone immediately, with the thought of it, and stirs up an aversion to this thought to such an extent that it is considered indecent even to call this vice by its proper name. But it is not so easy to produce a rational proof that unnatural, and even merely unpurposive, use of one's sexual attribute is inadmissible as being a violation of duty to oneself (and indeed, as far as its unnatural use is concerned, a violation in the highest degree). \u2014 The ground of proof is, indeed, that by it man surrenders his personality (throwing it away), since he uses himself merely as a means to satisfy an animal impulse. But this does not explain the high degree of violation of the humanity in one's own person by such a vice in its unnaturalness, which seems in terms of its form (the disposition it involves) to exceed even murdering oneself. It consists, then, in this...unnatural lust, makes man not only an object of enjoyment but, still further, a thing that is contrary to nature, that is, a loathsome object, and so deprives him of all respect for himself.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|title=Kant: The Metaphysics of Morals|date=1797|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GcEmAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&lpg=PT163&dq=The+ground+of+proof+is,+indeed,+that+by+it+a+man+surrenders+his+personality+(throwing+it+away),+since+he+uses+himself+as+a+means+to+satisfy+an+animal+impulse.+But+this+does+not+explain+the+high+degree+of+violation+of+the+humanity+in+one%27s+own+person+by+such#v=onepage&q=The%20ground%20of%20proof%20is%2C%20indeed%2C%20that%20by%20it%20a%20man%20surrenders%20his%20personality%20(throwing%20it%20away)%2C%20since%20he%20uses%20himself%20as%20a%20means%20to%20satisfy%20an%20animal%20impulse.%20But%20this%20does%20not%20explain%20the%20high%20degree%20of%20violation%20of%20the%20humanity%20in%20one's%20own%20person%20by%20such&f=false|isbn=9781107268487}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]] period, there were Protestant societies for moral purity that opposed masturbation. In the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer era]], there was very strict sexual morality in the Church. However, at the end of the  1960s, Protestant theologians set about redefining human sexuality. [[Siegfried Keil]] emerged as a leading figure in this movement but even he continued to oppose masturbation, seeing it as  immoral. However, in 1971, the Church published its \"Denkschrift zu Fragen der Sexualethik\" (\"Memorandum on Issues of Sexual Ethics\"), which took an extremely liberal position on masturbation. Sexologist [[Volkmar Sigusch]] claimed the positions in the memorandum read like they could have been written by liberal sex education teachers, rather than by pastors and theologians. Despite this liberalization, there was a growing alienation between the Church and faithful in the 1970s as people no longer turned to the church for advice on sexual morality but to doctors and sexual magazines. This was a dramatic shift from the 1950s, when the Churches had dominated the field of public and private morality in Germany. In the 1960s, theologians had been either criticised or respected by the media as moral figures but now they were simply ignored. However, the liberalization of the theologians and the pastors chiefly served to brand the majority view in the Church as backward-looking and traditionalist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gro\u00dfb\u00f6lting|first1=Thomas|title=Losing Heaven: Religion in Germany since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Berghahn Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWjoCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=ekd++masturbation#v=onepage&q=ekd%20%20masturbation&f=false|accessdate=15 April 2018|isbn=9781785332791}}</ref>\n\nDespite its liberalism, the 1971 memorandum still forbade sex outside of marriage, pornography usage and group sex.

When Paul speaks about impurity and sexual greed as idolatry in Ephesians 5:3-7 and Colossians 3:5, he accurately describes how it works. It begins with sexual impurity, the defilement of our imagination by depictions of sexual intercourse that present naked bodies as idols for us to admire. Our fixation on these images arouses disordered desires and make us more and more greedy for sexual satisfaction from things that God has not given to us for our enjoyment. Yet they fail to satisfy us and serve only to feed our growing appetite for them...Where masturbation is involved...the more ashamed we become, the more secretive we become; the more secretive we become and the more we hide in the darkness, the more vulnerable we become to the accusation and condemnation of Satan...You need to be careful that Satan does not distort your perception by making a fool of you and getting you to focus on the wrong thing. Nowhere in the Bible is masturbation explicitly forbidden. There is good reason for this because the problem does not come from masturbation, which is in itself neither good or bad, but the adulterous sexual fantasies that accompany it, as Christ makes clear in Matthew 5:28. That\u2019s the problem spiritually!...That\u2019s how Satan gets a hold on us through our imagination. If you use pornography to masturbate, you put another woman, an idol that promises heaven and gives you hell, sexually, in the place of your wife. It arouses your greed for what you don\u2019t have, greed for what God has not given for you to enjoy, greed that increases as you give in to it.

A. van Ginkel stated, when asked if it was sinful to masturbate if you are unmarried and you are fantasising about an unmarried girl, \"What is all-important is that you see your body as not of yourself. Your life belongs to the Lord! Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. God hates uncleanness. That may sound harsh, but God's Word speaks clearly when it comes to that. It would be best if you could project your desire in sincere love and faithfulness to her that God gives you!...But there's a problem there. You do not have her. You are not married. And maybe you do not want a woman out of God's hand at all!? You want to project your sexual fantasy on an unmarried woman. In your mind \"do it\" with her. Focused on yourself. However understandable, this is not a good solution...You seek biblical legitimacy and believe it to be in the fact that the Bible does not speak about self-gratification. (The passage about the sin of Onan does indeed have nothing to do with self-gratification.) But the Bible does speak out about a holy and God-focused life. Paul writes to the church in Corinth: All that you do, do it to the glory of God. Thinking of this Word alone, you have no biblical legitimacy for your sexual projections. Pray for God on your side, with whom you may live life to the honor of His Name. This includes your sexual life! This is desirable!\"<ref>http://www.refoweb.nl/vragenrubriek/23197/masturberen-en-fantaseren/</ref>\n\nThe American conservative Calvinist website, Reformed Answers, argues that masturbation is only sin if it entails lustful fantasies for someone other than the person's spouse: \"...if an act of masturbation expresses the sin of lust, then that act of masturbation can be condemned as sinful. But this argument cannot condemn acts of masturbation that do not give expression to the sin of lust.\" The site notes that masturbation can only be opposed on moral grounds, not natural ones: \"Some argue that masturbation is wrong on the basis of nature. That is, in a fashion similar to the argument based on Onan's sin, they argue that God did not design the human body and reproductive system to work in this manner, that God's general revelation in nature condemns the practice. This is a tenuous argument at best. In fact, there is some evidence to the contrary. For example, many human beings learn to masturbate without ever having been taught it or having heard about it. It would seem to be their \"natural\" impulse. Moreover, human beings are naturally equipped with the necessary body parts to accomplish masturbation (unlike most animals). It could be argued on these bases that it is natural. Moreover, most Protestants reject the idea that what is natural is necessarily what is good\u2014especially in light of our \"sin nature.\" This is simply a poor ground on which to base the argument against masturbation.\"<ref>http://reformedanswers.org/answer.asp/file/40098</ref>\n\nThe American Reformed author [[Jay E.

When masturbation grows out of a sense of this need for physical release due to unclean thoughts, it is sin.

When he does this, he then \u201cpractices what he preaches.\u201d Though he says that holiness is right and good, he has to live that way as well.

Satan has conveniently disguised this \u201cawful\u201d topic as something that ought not to be mentioned, and never to be preached. The church's response to this is a deafening silence...The topic of lust may sometimes be alluded to, but never developed into the precise \u201cdoctrine\u201d of the Bible's teaching on lust and masturbation, which really develops into a study on the fruit of the Spirit (love to Christ more than \u201cself\u201d, and self-control)...Since we are in desperate need for Biblical teaching on this subject, we turn to the church to teach us what it means to be sexually pure.

Kwee and David C. Hooper, addressed the issue in an academic paper.  They note that \"The Bible presents no clear theological ethic on masturbation...Of the many aspects of human sexuality that we address in our work, masturbation ranks as the most misunderstood for the lack of open, rational dialogue about this topic within the Christian community...Within evangelical frameworks of sexual ethics...there has never been a well-defined theological ethic of masturbation, in contrast to the ethics of pre-marital sex, marriage, and divorce that are worked out from foundational Christian anthropological assertions about gender, sexuality, and their relationship to the imago Dei...Masturbation falls thus within the proverbial grey area of evangelical sexual ethics.\"<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nThey go on to note that \"we find that the questions that Christian young people ask about masturbation can be reduced to two essential queries. Christian youth want to know whether masturbation is \"right or wrong\" (i.e., what is the \"correct\" moral stance to take based on what the Bible says?), and whether masturbation is \"normal\" (i.e., what can we say about the psychological dimensions of masturbation?)\"<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nAnswering the first question, they note that \"The Bible does not directly address masturbation, leaving Christians to articulate a moral stance from various scriptures that in our view cannot support a deontological prohibition of masturbation...Today the general consensus in the Christian community is that Genesis 38:6-10 is irrelevant to masturbation. Modern readers of course understand Onan's act not as masturbation but as coitus interuptus. The technical designation of the act, however, is unimportant compared to the ethical violations manifesting through the act. The interpretive context for Genesis 38:6-10 is found in the ancient Israelite law (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)...Whatever his reasons for not consummating intercourse, Onan was punished for violating a specific Hebrew law and for failing in his covenantal duty to his deceased brother. Onan was judged for undisclosed but probably exploitative intentions...and certainly for his callous repudiation of his traditional obligations of familial care and responsibility.\"<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nThey state also that \"Our...objection to using Matthew 5:27-30 as a basis for the blanket condemnation of masturbation is that such an interpretation can only be supported by de-contextualizing this passage from Jesus\u2019 overall message...[and]...proper contextual interpretation of Leviticus 15:16-18 would therefore support the view that masturbation in and of itself is morally neutral.\"<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nThey note that \"There is a moral difference between masturbation done in the presence of pornography or the phone sex service (inherently selfish and exploitative mediums), and masturbation as the sexual expression of a fuller yearning for connectedness, i.e., connectedness that is not primarily sexual\",<ref name=\"kwee\"/> concluding that \"Scripture does not directly address masturbation, giving rise to guilt-inducing misconceptions about a behavior that is extremely salient to unmarried college-aged Christian men whose value system leads them to eschew pre-marital sex\".<ref name=\"kwee\"/>\n\nThe American Evangelical scholar, Judith K.

The historical church has had difficulty explaining this practice, but there is no good reason to lump it with sexual immorality and heap guilt on single people in particular...For most males and females, masturbation is a natural part of self exploration.

He notes that Onan's sin was about failing to do his duty under the Levirate law mentioned in Deu 25:5-6. Under this law it was \"the closest brother's duty to ensure that his family survived by marrying the widow. When Onan \"spilled his seed on the earth,\" it means that he refused to get a seed to his brother and instead utilized his brother's widow for his own sexual pleasure.\" He goes on to note that  another text which is sometimes invoked is Matthew 5:27-30. Here, he says, Jesus is simply warning that it is not only wrong to cheat in one's action but also that it is wrong to cheat in one's heart. Therefore a person should not look with lustful intent at someone else's wife. He says these texts are not about masturbation and that the Bible does not explicitly mention that masturbation is a sin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianmolk.se/2011/09/vad-sager-bibeln-om-onani/|title=Vad s\u00e4ger Bibeln om onani?|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother Swedish Pentecostal, [[Christer \u00c5berg]], has written about the practice on a Welsh language  site. He states, \"First of all, nowhere is masturbation discussed in the Bible...But is masturbation a sin? As I understand it, it is not a sin. The answer is \"no.\" But it can lead to sin, so, therefore, I think one should be careful with it. I mean if a guy masturbates and fantasizes with  desire for a girl, it will be wrong...It's really like everything: It's not a sin to drink alcohol, but it can lead to sin if you drink yourself drunk. Nor is it a sin to dance, but it can lead to sin, etc., etc. The Bible says that \"Everything is legal to me, but not everything is beneficial. Everything is granted to me , but I will not let anything take power over me.\" (1 Corinthians 06:12).\"<ref>https://www.apg29.nu/ar-onani-en-synd-1334/cy</ref> In a follow-up article, he wrote, \"Some time ago, I wrote an article about masturbating and surprised some. I wrote that it was not too bad to masturbate, but it could lead to sin. Maybe the best advice in today's society is to help with masturbation. I think of an article in the Expressen newspaper about a \"masturbation competition\". This is a clear example that it can open you up to an evil influence, and lead you to sin. We live in a time when it is important to lead a clean and devoted life to Jesus Christ. For you, live near Jesus so that you do not risk going wrong. And then you will have no interest to try the things of this \"good\" world.\"<ref>https://www.apg29.nu/index.php?hl=cy&artid=1697</ref>\n\nThe Texan Pentecostal pastor and church founder, Tom Brown, has written on the subject of \"Is Masturbation a Sin?\", stating that \"Masturbation has been around for a long time, and since God does not clearly condemn it, I would not be too bothered with it, either. Masturbation is practiced far more than adultery or fornication, yet God is practically silent on the issue. This ought to tell you that God is not overly concerned with it...However, let me caution you against addiction to masturbation. Just like most things, masturbation can turn into an addiction...Paul said, \"'Everything is permissible for me'\u2014but I will not be mastered by anything\" (1 Cor 6:12). This includes masturbation. Also, you should never use pornography to masturbate...Concerning single people, I have no advice other than a prohibition [on] pornography.\"<ref name=\"tbm\">http://tbm.org/masturbation.htm</ref>\n\nHe goes on to note, \"If a believer uses masturbation to alleviate sexual temptation, that's far better than actually being tempted to commit fornication or adultery. I would rather have a man masturbate than go to a prostitute...Another thought, if masturbation is sinful, then you would expect there to be bad health consequences to it, such as found in adultery, homosexuality, and fornication (diseases for one thing). Instead, research has found that masturbation serves to release sexual tension.\"<ref name=\"tbm\"/>\n\n=====Quakers=====\nIn 1960, the British Friends Home Service published a pamphlet on marriage that was read and approved on both sides of the Atlantic that stated that \"Masturbation as a child is healthy, but not as an adult.\" However, four years later, in 1964, the Quaker physician, Dr. Mary Calderone, argued for the emerging view that masturbation was a normal useful means for \"relieving natural tension in a healthy and satisfying way.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/sex.htm|title=\"Sex is not a shortcut to spirituality:\" Liberal Quakers|website=www.swarthmore.edu|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Quakers, while formulating a testimony on sexual intimacy, have noted that \"one possibility for a testimony of intimacy is a pronatalist position that is focused on the imperative to have children. This is a long-standing position of the Roman Catholic Church and a teaching that has considerable sway among many Protestant Evangelicals...In this teaching, [the] main purpose [of sex] is procreation...In this pronatalism, masturbation is...wrong, as is contraception, but there are no clear scriptural texts against these practices. Their prohibition is taken to follow from the central teaching that the purpose of sex is the creation of legitimate offspring...For several reasons, Friends are likely to feel uncomfortable with this pronatalist framing of the morality of intimate relationships.\nFor many Friends, the most serious objection of all...would be pronatalism's steadfast focus on increasing the population. With seven billion human beings alive today on planet Earth, further population increase should hardly be the predominant emphasis informing relationships of intimacy.

White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], in the mid-19th century said she had spiritual visions from God that gave her guidance on the Christian life.  She warned against overly-stimulating foods, sex, and masturbation, which she referred to as \"solitary vice.\"  She warned her followers of her visions of disfigured humans and the consequences of masturbation not only destroying one's life, but preventing access to Heaven when Jesus comes in the first resurrection. She said that masturbation was the cause of many sicknesses in adults from cancer to lung disease.  White even stated that masturbation claimed many sinners' lives prematurely. She believed that one's diet had a direct correlation with one's urge to masturbate. She said that a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, wheat breads, and water would lead to a diminished urge to masturbate and thus would lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life. To ultimately produce a guide for future generations she said solitary vice was the cause of hereditary insanity, cancer, and other deadly diseases; clearly appealing to parents to protect their children by not engaging in solitary vice.<ref>Numbers, Ronald L, \"Sex, Science, and Salvation: The Sexual Advice of Ellen G.

This law is derived from the story of Onan (Gen. 38:8-10), who practiced coitus interruptus as a means of birth control to avoid fathering a child for his deceased brother. G-d killed Onan for this sin. Although Onan's act was not truly masturbation, Jewish law takes a very broad view of the acts prohibited by this passage, and forbids any act of ha-sh'cha'tat zerah (destruction of the seed), that is, ejaculation outside of the vagina. In fact, the prohibition is so strict that one passage in the Talmud states, \"in the case of a man, the hand that reaches below the navel should be chopped off.\" (Niddah 13a). The issue is somewhat less clear for women. Obviously, spilling the seed is not going to happen in female masturbation, and there is no explicit Torah prohibition against female masturbation. Nevertheless, Judaism generally frowns upon female masturbation as \"impure thoughts.\"</ref> By virtue of Onan, traditional Judaism condemns [male] masturbation.<ref name=myjewishlearning>Maimonides, ''Commentary to the Mishnah, Sanhedrin'' 7:4, apud {{cite book|last1=Dorff|first1=Elliot N.|author-link1=Elliot N.

Apart from a person who has taken vow of Brahmacharya, Hindus are free to engage in sexual activities. However, this is only within the limits of heterosexual marriage. According to Hinduism, life begins at the Brahmacharya in which they are directed to chastely advance themselves educationally and spiritually to prepare themselves for a life of furthering their dharma and karma ; only once they reach the Grihastya or \"householder\" stage, which begins with marriage, can they seek kama and artha through their vocations.\n\n== Buddhism ==\n{{see also|Buddhist ethics|karma|Ta\u1e47h\u0101|Vinaya}}\nThe most used formulation of Buddhist ethics are the [[Five Precepts]]. These precepts take the form of voluntary personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third precept is \"to refrain from committing sexual misconduct\".<ref name=HIGG>{{cite web | last =Higgins | first =Winton | title =Buddhist Sexual Ethics | publisher =BuddhaNet Magazine | url =http://www.buddhanet.net/winton_s.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref> However, different [[schools of Buddhism]] have differing interpretations of what constitutes sexual misconduct.\n\nBuddhism was advanced by [[Gautama Buddha]] as a method by which human beings could end [[dukkha]] (suffering) and escape [[samsara]] (cyclic existence). Normally this entails practicing [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and following the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] as a way to subdue the passions which, along with the [[skandha]]s, cause suffering and rebirth. Masturbation ([[Pali]]: ''sukkavissa\u1e6d\u1e6dhi'') is accordingly seen as problematic for a person who wishes to attain liberation. According to a lecture by Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, it is important to abstain from \"sexual intercourse, including masturbation, any action that brings an orgasm and so forth, because this results in a rebirth.\"<ref name=thubten>{{cite web|title=Kopan Course No. 03 & No. 04 (1972-73): Appendix One: The Eight Mahayana Precepts|author=Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&id=236&chid=381|access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>  He clarifies: \"Generally, the action that is the opposite of the precept brings the opposite negative result, takes us further from enlightenment, and keeps us longer in samsara.\"<ref name=thubten />\n\nShravasti Dhammika, a [[bhikkhu|Theravadin monk]], cites the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'' in his online \"Guide to Buddhism A to Z\", and states the following:\n{{quote|Masturbation (''sukkavissa\u1e6d\u1e6dhi'') is the act of stimulating one's own sexual organs (''samb\u0101dha'') to the stage of orgasm (''adhikavega''). In the ''[[Kama Sutra|K\u0101ma S\u016btra]]'' male masturbation is called \"seizing the lion\" (''si\u1e43h\u0101k\u0101ranta''). Some people during the Buddha's time believed that masturbation could have a therapeutic effect on the mind and the body (Vin. III, 109), although the Buddha disagreed with this. According to the Vinaya, it is an offence of some seriousness for monks or nuns to masturbate (Vin. III, 111) although the Buddha gave no guidance on this matter to lay people. However, Buddhism could agree with contemporary medical opinion that masturbation is a normal expression of the sexual drive and is physically and psychologically harmless, as long as it does not become a preoccupation or a substitute for ordinary sexual relations. Guilt and self-disgust about masturbating is certainly more harmful than masturbation itself.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Shravasti Dhammika|authorlink1=Shravasti Dhammika|title=Masturbation|url=http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=249|website=Guide to Buddhism A-Z|publisher=Bhante Dhammika|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nHis opinions regarding non-Buddhists notwithstanding, the Buddha did encourage his serious disciples to limit their sexual behaviour or to embrace celibacy.<ref>{{cite web|author1=M.

Not only are monastics [[celibacy|celibate]], but they also take more and stricter vows in order to conquer their desires. In the Theravadin tradition, masturbation is also stressed as being harmful for [[Up\u0101saka and Up\u0101sik\u0101|up\u0101sakas and up\u0101sik\u0101s]] (lay devotees) who practice the Eight Precepts on [[Uposatha]] days, leading a more ascetic lifestyle that does not allow for masturbation. Indeed, masturbation is explicitly characterised as sexual misconduct in the ''Up\u0101saka\u015b\u012bla s\u016btra'':\n{{quote|\"If sex is practised under the inappropriate times (times not allowed by precepts), [at] inappropriate place[s] (places not allowed by precepts),  with non-female[s], with virgin[s], with a married wife, if sex relates to self-body, it is known as sexual misconduct.\"<ref>S\u016btra of the Up\u0101saka Precepts, fascicle 6, Chapter 24a</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, some contemporary writers on Buddhism suggest that masturbation is essentially harmless for a layperson.<ref>{{cite web|title=\t A Sensitive Topic|website=Daily Buddhism|author1=Brian Schell|date=January 8, 2009|access-date=January 9, 2017|url=http://www.dailybuddhism.com/archives/1081}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Beliefnet.com|title=Masturbation: Does Your Religion Give It a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down?|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Love-Family/2001/07/Masturbation-Does-Your-Religion-Give-It-A-Thumbs-Up-Or-Thumbs-Down.aspx|access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Taoism ==\nSome teachers and practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], Taoist [[Meditation#Taoism|meditative]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] say that masturbation can cause a lowered energy level in men.  They say that ejaculation in this way reduces \"origin [[qi]]\" from [[dantian]], the energy center located in the lower abdomen.  Some maintain that sex with a partner does not do this because the partners replenish each other's qi. Some practitioners therefore say that males should not practice martial arts for at least 48 hours after masturbation while others prescribe up to six months, because the loss of Origin Qi does not allow new qi to be [[Qigong|created]] for this kind of time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n \nSome Taoists strongly discouraged female masturbation. Women were encouraged to practice massaging techniques upon themselves, but were also instructed to avoid thinking sexual thoughts if experiencing a feeling of pleasure. Otherwise, the woman's \"labia will open wide and the sexual secretions will flow.\" If this happened, the woman would lose part of her life force, and this could bring illness and shortened life.<ref>Wile (1994), p. 59.</ref>\n\n== Zoroastrianism ==\nThe act of masturbation is known as '''Shoeythra Gunaah''', or '''Shoithra-gunah''', which can also be used to refer to [[onanism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zoroastriansnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/therationaleofpatet.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Zoroastrian holy book ''[[Avesta]]'', with its stress on physical cleanliness, lists voluntary masturbation among the unpardonable sins that one can commit.

By the waste of muscular tissue he is hardly able to undergo the exertion required for the discharge of his daily duties. But it is the nervous tissue that suffers most, inasmuch as his memory fails, his intellect becomes dull, he becomes morose and peevish, and shuns the agreeable society of his friends and relatives, and consequently he becomes subject to melancholia. His mind soon becomes exhausted after slight application and its power of retaining impressions is lost. If he becomes subject to melancholia, he sometimes attempts to commit suicide. When we consider these evil effects following masturbation, we do not wonder why it is considered an inexpiable crime.<ref name=\"Dubash1906\">{{cite book|last=Dubash|first=Sorabji Edalji|title=The Zoroastrian Sanitary Code, with Critical and Explanatory Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZAcvgAACAAJ|series=K.R.
