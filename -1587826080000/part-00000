The game has multiple modes, with the main three being Grand Battle, Valley Skirmish and Abyssal Clash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/game-modes-overview/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Game Modes Overview (Abyssal Clash, Hook Wars, etc.)|last=Green|date=2018-02-20|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Players compete in these matches which on average last for around 12 - 18 minutes. Players aim to destroy turrets on the map, in order to destroy the core.\n\nThe overall gameplay of ''Arena of Valor'' highly resembles a game called ''[[League of Legends]]'', a MOBA game developed and published by [[Riot Games]], which is a subsidiary of Tencent.\n\nPlayers control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn level up in various ways. Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. These actions also increase XP the player has, making them more powerful. The items purchased do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of the match.\n\nMatches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes, or arcana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/tips-to-earn-gold/|title=Tips to Earn Gold|website=Arena of Valor (AoV) Wiki Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to attempt to go up in tiers in order to be matched with players who are at their skill level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/ranked-match/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Ranked Match (Game Modes)|last=Green|date=2017-11-18|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.\n\nThere are various game modes, with 5v5, also known as Grand Battle or Ranked, being the most popular. Here, players can choose a role to play in, such as marksmen, who do high damage yet have little health, or a tank, which has a lot of health. The team then coordinate in order to destroy the towers, and finally to destroy the enemy base. Players can choose to play in the 'jungle', which allows them to level up quicker and make a large difference to the game. \n\nIn addition to this, Valley Skirmish is a 3v3 game mode, using a much smaller map. In this version of the game, there is only one tower. These games are designed to be much quicker, for the player that does not have time for a longer game, and typically last for 4 - 6 minutes. Abyssal Clash is a game mode where players are randomly selected heroes, and have two towers they must destroy in order to reach the enemy base. Arena of Valor also has a Deathmatch mode, however this is not as popular as the other three modes.\n\n=== Hero types ===\nThere are currently 98 heroes in ''Arena of Valor'' as of April 6, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor Hero List|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> ''Arena of Valor'' divides the heroes into numerous categories that each play different roles.  The most notable difference is the type of damage a hero deals - some heroes deal physical damage, which can be countered by the armor stat, whilst other heroes deal mainly magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. However, some heroes deal both types of damage, and some heroes deal 'true' damage, which cannot be countered by either the armor or magic resistance stat. All heroes are classified as one of six categories, however some heroes can overlap and go into more than one category. \n\n* Marksman: Also known as \"AD Carry/ADC\", marksmen are ranged heroes that usually deal physical damage mostly through their auto attack. This hero type often deals sustained damage, and therefore are useful in teamfights in order to reduce the health of the opponent. In addition to this, they are useful in taking down objectives in order to win the game. However, they do not have much health and therefore are very fragile and vulnerable. Examples of marksmen are Tel'Annas, Valhein, and Yorn.\n* Mage: Mages are sometimes known as \"AP Carry/APC\". These heroes deal lots of burst magic damage. Some mages tend to be fragile, while some mages tend to be more durable, depends on respective itemization. Mages are a mix of ranged heroes, which deal high amounts of burst damage from afar, or melee heroes, which deal lots of damage from close up, or a mixture of both.  Examples of mages are Lauriel, Liliana, and Tulen.\n* Assassin: These are heroes that are designed to deal large amounts of damage quickly, and often do not have much health. This hero type often searches for the marksman or mage from the enemy team, as well as any other fragile heroes, and also being responsible to shut down any enemy unit that is on a killing spree. They have high mobility and burst damage in order to be able to strike at valuable targets on the oppositions team. Examples of assassins are Murad, Nakroth, and Zill.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Tanks are heroes that have large amounts of HP, and usually built completely defensive to be able to take damage for the team.  As a result, they often deal little damage. However, they often have abilities known as 'crowd control' that allow them to inhibit the movement of the enemy team. In addition to this, they can use these abilities to initiate a teamfight, or to prevent the enemy team from attacking high priority targets such as ally marksman or mage. Examples of tanks are Xeniel, Thane, and Toro.\n* Warrior:  Heroes that blend the attributes of damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. Warriors usually have balanced amount of health, defenses, and attack damage, which is common designation for close-range melee duelist. Thus, they able to survive in a long period of fight and excel in doing continuos sustain damage. This type of heroes are also great against all odds, and tend to be extremely strong in 1v1 scenario. Examples of warriors are Florentino, Rourke, and Omen.\n* Support: Heroes whose abilities aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies (such as movement speed buffs), debuffing the enemy team (such as stunning), or a combination of the above. Support heroes are often paired with the marksman in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesn't require to kill minions, but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy heroes. Support heroes usually aids ally marksman as they are often weaker during the early phase of the game and need assistance in order to survive. Example of supports are Alice, Annette, and Krizzix.\n\nPlayers can purchase items, which make a large impact on the hero stats and playstyle. An example of this is Zephys, a dual warrior/assassin class. He have a passive ability that make him increase damage reduction against incoming damage to him based on the percentage of the amount of health loss. If only offensive items are bought, he will deal a lot of damage but has low amount of health and defenses, and may not survive for long. If Zephys purchase a mix of offensive and defensive items, he can soak damage for the team while he still be able to deal noticable amount of damage. If Zephys buy only defensive items, he can boost his damage reduction passive to its maximum potential, being literally almost impossible to die in most circumstances, but he will deal drastically low amount of damage.\n\nThis kind of playstyle can be applied to all heroes, allowing tanks to act as warriors, or for mages to act as supports, and vice versa.\n\n== History and development ==\n''Arena of Valor'' (formerly ''Strike of Kings'') is an international adaptation of ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao|Honor of Kings]]'' for markets outside mainland China. In 2015, Tencent approached [[Riot Games]] and asked them to turn their popular [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) game ''[[League of Legends]]'' into a mobile title. However, Riot Games declined and claimed that the gameplay of ''League of Legends'' could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent then proceeded to create their own mobile MOBA game, ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao]]'', roughly translated to English as ''Honor of Kings'', and was released in November 26, 2015. Nevertheless, several Riot Games employees deemed that the design of characters and abilities in ''Honor of Kings'' were \"blatantly ripping off the intellectual property of ''League of Legends''\", and reportedly brought these concerns to Tencent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/chinas-top-mobile-game-complete-league-legends-ripoff|title=China top mobile game  is a complete League of Legends ripoff|last=Custer|first=Christopher|date=July 27, 2016|website=Tech in Asia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tencent then responded that they would changing its own game enough to sell as a standalone product with no relation to ''League of Legends''. Despite this, ''Honor of Kings'' already gained massive popularity in China at this point. Tencent felt its too late to make huge changes to the game, so Tencent decided that ''Honor of Kings'' will only go through small necessary changes while the international release of the game outside mainland China will be the one that featuring different contents, hence leading to the creation of ''Arena of Valor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-strained-relationship-tencent-declining-players-mobile-games-information-32079|title=Riot\u2019s relationship with Tencent has reportedly been strained over declining profits and mobile games|last=Mickunas |first=Aaron |website=dotesports|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> \n\n''Arena of Valor'' is developed by [[TiMi Studios]] with the same engine and UI design as ''Honor of Kings'' and published by [[Tencent Games]] for western marketing, with [[Garena]] joined the development as they helped to westernize the atmosphere of the game.

The game has multiple modes, with the main three being Grand Battle, Valley Skirmish and Abyssal Clash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/game-modes-overview/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Game Modes Overview (Abyssal Clash, Hook Wars, etc.)|last=Green|date=2018-02-20|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Players compete in these matches which on average last for around 12 - 18 minutes. Players aim to destroy turrets on the map, in order to destroy the core.\n\nThe overall gameplay of ''Arena of Valor'' highly resembles a game called ''[[League of Legends]]'', a MOBA game developed and published by [[Riot Games]], which is a subsidiary of Tencent.\n\nPlayers control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn level up in various ways. Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. These actions also increase XP the player has, making them more powerful. The items purchased do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of the match.\n\nMatches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes, or arcana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/tips-to-earn-gold/|title=Tips to Earn Gold|website=Arena of Valor (AoV) Wiki Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to attempt to go up in tiers in order to be matched with players who are at their skill level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://samurai-gamers.com/arena-of-valor/ranked-match/|title=Arena of Valor (AoV) - Ranked Match (Game Modes)|last=Green|date=2017-11-18|website=SAMURAI GAMERS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.\n\nThere are various game modes, with 5v5, also known as Grand Battle or Ranked, being the most popular. Here, players can choose a role to play in, such as marksmen, who do high damage yet have little health, or a tank, which has a lot of health. The team then coordinate in order to destroy the towers, and finally to destroy the enemy base. Players can choose to play in the 'jungle', which allows them to level up quicker and make a large difference to the game. \n\nIn addition to this, Valley Skirmish is a 3v3 game mode, using a much smaller map. In this version of the game, there is only one tower. These games are designed to be much quicker, for the player that does not have time for a longer game, and typically last for 4 - 6 minutes. Abyssal Clash is a game mode where players are randomly selected heroes, and have two towers they must destroy in order to reach the enemy base. Arena of Valor also has a Deathmatch mode, however this is not as popular as the other three modes.\n\n=== Hero types ===\nThere are currently 98 heroes in ''Arena of Valor'' as of April 6, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arenaofvalor.com/|title=Arena of Valor Hero List|website=Arena of Valor|language=en|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> ''Arena of Valor'' divides the heroes into numerous categories that each play different roles.  The most notable difference is the type of damage a hero deals - some heroes deal physical damage, which can be countered by the armor stat, whilst other heroes deal mainly magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. However, some heroes deal both types of damage, and some heroes deal 'true' damage, which cannot be countered by either the armor or magic resistance stat. All heroes are classified as one of six categories, however some heroes can overlap and go into more than one category. \n\n* Marksman: Also known as \"AD Carry/ADC\", marksmen are ranged heroes that usually deal physical damage mostly through their auto attack. This hero type often deals sustained damage, and therefore are useful in teamfights in order to reduce the health of the opponent. In addition to this, they are useful in taking down objectives in order to win the game. However, they do not have much health and therefore are very fragile and vulnerable. Examples of marksmen are Tel'Annas, Valhein, and Yorn.\n* Mage: Mages are sometimes known as \"AP Carry/APC\". These heroes deal lots of burst magic damage. Some mages tend to be fragile, while some mages tend to be more durable, depends on respective itemization. Mages are a mix of ranged heroes, which deal high amounts of burst damage from afar, or melee heroes, which deal lots of damage from close up, or a mixture of both.  Examples of mages are Lauriel, Liliana, and Tulen.\n* Assassin: These are heroes that are designed to deal large amounts of damage quickly, and often do not have much health. This hero type often searches for the marksman or mage from the enemy team, as well as any other fragile heroes, and also being responsible to shut down any enemy unit that is on a killing spree. They have high mobility and burst damage in order to be able to strike at valuable targets on the oppositions team. Examples of assassins are Murad, Nakroth, and Zill.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Tanks are heroes that have large amounts of HP, and usually built completely defensive to be able to take damage for the team.  As a result, they often deal little damage. However, they often have abilities known as 'crowd control' that allow them to inhibit the movement of the enemy team. In addition to this, they can use these abilities to initiate a teamfight, or to prevent the enemy team from attacking high priority targets such as ally marksman or mage. Examples of tanks are Xeniel, Thane, and Toro.\n* Warrior:  Heroes that blend the attributes of damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. Warriors usually have balanced amount of health, defenses, and attack damage, which is common designation for close-range melee duelist. Thus, they able to survive in a long period of fight and excel in doing continuos sustain damage. This type of heroes are also great against all odds, and tend to be extremely strong in 1v1 scenario. Examples of warriors are Florentino, Rourke, and Omen.\n* Support: Heroes whose abilities aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies (such as movement speed buffs), debuffing the enemy team (such as stunning), or a combination of the above. Support heroes are often paired with the marksman in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesn't require to kill minions, but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy heroes. Support heroes usually aids ally marksman as they are often weaker during the early phase of the game and need assistance in order to survive. Example of supports are Alice, Annette, and Krizzix.\n\nPlayers can purchase items, which make a large impact on the hero stats and playstyle. An example of this is Zephys, a dual warrior/assassin class. He have a passive ability that make him increase damage reduction against incoming damage to him based on the percentage of the amount of health loss. If only offensive items are bought, he will deal a lot of damage but has low amount of health and defenses, and may not survive for long. If Zephys purchase a mix of offensive and defensive items, he can soak damage for the team while he still be able to deal noticable amount of damage. If Zephys buy only defensive items, he can boost his damage reduction passive to its maximum potential, being literally almost impossible to die in most circumstances, but he will deal drastically low amount of damage.\n\nThis kind of playstyle can be applied to all heroes, allowing tanks to act as warriors, or for mages to act as supports, and vice versa.\n\n== History and development ==\n''Arena of Valor'' (formerly ''Strike of Kings'') is an international adaptation of ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao|Honor of Kings]]'' for markets outside mainland China. In 2015, Tencent approached [[Riot Games]] and asked them to turn their popular [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) game ''[[League of Legends]]'' into a mobile title. However, Riot Games declined and claimed that the gameplay of ''League of Legends'' could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent then proceeded to create their own mobile MOBA game, ''[[Wangzhe Rongyao]]'', roughly translated to English as ''Honor of Kings'', and was released in November 26, 2015. Nevertheless, several Riot Games employees deemed that the design of characters and abilities in ''Honor of Kings'' were \"blatantly ripping off the intellectual property of ''League of Legends''\", and reportedly brought these concerns to Tencent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/chinas-top-mobile-game-complete-league-legends-ripoff|title=China top mobile game  is a complete League of Legends ripoff|last=Custer|first=Christopher|date=July 27, 2016|website=Tech in Asia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tencent then responded that they would changing its own game enough to sell as a standalone product with no relation to ''League of Legends''. Despite this, ''Honor of Kings'' already gained massive popularity in China at this point. Tencent felt its too late to make huge changes to the game, so Tencent decided that ''Honor of Kings'' will only go through small necessary changes while the international release of the game outside mainland China will be the one that featuring different contents, hence leading to the creation of ''Arena of Valor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-strained-relationship-tencent-declining-players-mobile-games-information-32079|title=Riot\u2019s relationship with Tencent has reportedly been strained over declining profits and mobile games|last=Mickunas |first=Aaron |website=dotesports|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> \n\n''Arena of Valor'' is developed by [[TiMi Studios]] with the same engine and UI design as ''Honor of Kings'' and published by [[Tencent Games]] for western marketing, with [[Garena]] joined the development as they helped to westernize the atmosphere of the game. The in-game characters have been swapped from characters inspired by [[Chinese folklore]] [[Chinese mythology|and mythology]], to characters inspired by [[European folklore]] and some [[mythology|mythologies from other nations]] with blend a variety of elements including [[Lovecraftian horror]], [[steampunk]], [[high fantasy]], and [[sword and sorcery]] to appeal audiences outside mainland China, with the appearance of in-game characters mostly recycled but with fresh revamped designs of characters from ''[[Heroes of Newerth]]'', a MOBA game that Garena had acquired from [[S2 Games]].

Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, [[Little Richard]].

While gospel was popular, Cooke saw that fans were mostly limited to low-income, rural parts of the country, and sought to branch out. Cooke later admitted he got an endorsement for a career in pop music from the least likely man, his pastor father. \"My father told me it was not what I sang that was important, but that God gave me a voice and musical talent and the true use of His gift was to share it and make people happy.\" Taking the name \"Sam Cooke\", he sought a fresh start in pop.\n\nIn 1957, Cooke appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[The Guy Mitchell Show]]''.

In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received [[blues music|blues]]-inflected LP in 1963, ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'', and his most critically acclaimed studio album, ''[[Ain't That Good News (album)|Ain't That Good News]]'', which featured five singles, in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/sam-cooke|title=Sam Cooke \u2013 Billboard Charts|website=2019 Billboard|access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Cooke signed a five-year contract for [[Allen Klein]] to manage Kags Music and SAR Records and made him his manager. Klein negotiated a five-year deal (three years plus two option years) with RCA Victor in which a holding company, Tracey, Ltd, named after Cooke's daughter, owned by Klein and managed by J. W. Alexander, would produce and own Cooke's recordings. RCA Victor would get exclusive distribution rights in exchange for 6 percent royalty payments and payments for the recording sessions. For tax reasons, Cooke would receive preferred stock in Tracey instead of an initial cash advance of $100,000.

Franklin shouted back that there was no one in her office except herself, but the enraged Cooke did not believe her and forced his way into the office, naked save for one shoe and a sport jacket. He violently grabbed her, demanding again to know the woman's whereabouts. According to Franklin, she grappled with Cooke, the two of them fell to the floor, and she then got up and ran to retrieve a gun. She said she then fired at Cooke in [[self-defense]] because she feared for her life. Cooke was struck once in the [[torso]]. According to Franklin, he exclaimed, \"Lady, you shot me\", in a tone that expressed perplexity instead of anger, before mounting a last charge at her. She said she beat him over his head with a broomstick before he finally fell, mortally wounded by the gunshot.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 628}}\n\nThe motel's owner, Evelyn Carr,<ref group=note>Some sources identify the motel owner's last name as \"Card,\" according to Guralnick</ref> said that she had been on the telephone with Franklin at the time of the incident. Carr said she overheard Cooke's intrusion and the ensuing conflict and gunshot. She called the police to request that officers go to the motel, telling them she believed a shooting had occurred.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=619}}\n\nA [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] was convened to investigate the incident. The woman who had accompanied Cooke to the motel was identified as Elisa Boyer, who had also called the police that night several minutes before Carr had. Boyer had called from a telephone booth near the motel.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 627}}\n\nBoyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She said that once in one of the motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and then stripped her to her panties, at which point she was sure he was going to [[rape]] her. Cooke allowed her to use the bathroom, of which she attempted an escape but found that the window was firmly shut. According to Boyer, she returned to the main room where Cooke continued his groping. When he excused himself to make use of the bathroom, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=616\u2013619}}\n\nBoyer's story is the only account of what happened between her and Cooke that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by diners at Martoni's Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening, suggest that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with his clothing to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=643}}<ref name=Wolff /> Cooke was reportedly carrying a large amount of money at Martoni's, according to restaurant employees and friends. However a search of Boyer's purse by police revealed nothing except a $20 bill, and a search of Cooke's Ferrari found only a money clip with $108 and a few loose coins. On January 11, 1965, one month to the day after Cooke's death, Boyer was arrested for [[prostitution]] when a man offered her $40 for sex, only to promptly show her a badge. The charges were dismissed after it was determined to be a case of entrapment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |title=The Death of Sam Cooke |last=Krajicek |first=David |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053736/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, questions about Boyer's role were beyond the scope of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting. Boyer's leaving the motel room with almost all of Cooke's clothing, and the fact that tests showed Cooke was inebriated at the time, provided a plausible explanation to the inquest jurors for Cooke's bizarre behavior and state of dress.

[[Art Rupe]], head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and producer [[Bumps Blackwell]] were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, [[Little Richard]].

While gospel was popular, Cooke saw that fans were mostly limited to low-income, rural parts of the country, and sought to branch out. Cooke later admitted he got an endorsement for a career in pop music from the least likely man, his pastor father. \"My father told me it was not what I sang that was important, but that God gave me a voice and musical talent and the true use of His gift was to share it and make people happy.\" Taking the name \"Sam Cooke\", he sought a fresh start in pop.\n\nIn 1957, Cooke appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[The Guy Mitchell Show]]''.

He was a prolific songwriter and wrote most of the songs he recorded. He also had a hand in overseeing some of the song arrangements. In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received [[blues music|blues]]-inflected LP in 1963, ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'', and his most critically acclaimed studio album, ''[[Ain't That Good News (album)|Ain't That Good News]]'', which featured five singles, in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/sam-cooke|title=Sam Cooke \u2013 Billboard Charts|website=2019 Billboard|access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Cooke signed a five-year contract for [[Allen Klein]] to manage Kags Music and SAR Records and made him his manager. Klein negotiated a five-year deal (three years plus two option years) with RCA Victor in which a holding company, Tracey, Ltd, named after Cooke's daughter, owned by Klein and managed by J. W.

Franklin shouted back that there was no one in her office except herself, but the enraged Cooke did not believe her and forced his way into the office, naked save for one shoe and a sport jacket. He violently grabbed her, demanding again to know the woman's whereabouts. According to Franklin, she grappled with Cooke, the two of them fell to the floor, and she then got up and ran to retrieve a gun. She said she then fired at Cooke in [[self-defense]] because she feared for her life. Cooke was struck once in the [[torso]]. According to Franklin, he exclaimed, \"Lady, you shot me\", in a tone that expressed perplexity instead of anger, before mounting a last charge at her. She said she beat him over his head with a broomstick before he finally fell, mortally wounded by the gunshot.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 628}}\n\nThe motel's owner, Evelyn Carr,<ref group=note>Some sources identify the motel owner's last name as \"Card,\" according to Guralnick</ref> said that she had been on the telephone with Franklin at the time of the incident. Carr said she overheard Cooke's intrusion and the ensuing conflict and gunshot. She called the police to request that officers go to the motel, telling them she believed a shooting had occurred.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=619}}\n\nA [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] was convened to investigate the incident. The woman who had accompanied Cooke to the motel was identified as Elisa Boyer, who had also called the police that night several minutes before Carr had. Boyer had called from a telephone booth near the motel.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 627}}\n\nBoyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She said that once in one of the motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and then stripped her to her panties, at which point she was sure he was going to [[rape]] her. Cooke allowed her to use the bathroom, of which she attempted an escape but found that the window was firmly shut. According to Boyer, she returned to the main room where Cooke continued his groping. When he excused himself to make use of the bathroom, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=616\u2013619}}\n\nBoyer's story is the only account of what happened between her and Cooke that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by diners at Martoni's Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening, suggest that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with his clothing to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=643}}<ref name=Wolff /> Cooke was reportedly carrying a large amount of money at Martoni's, according to restaurant employees and friends. However a search of Boyer's purse by police revealed nothing except a $20 bill, and a search of Cooke's Ferrari found only a money clip with $108 and a few loose coins. On January 11th, 1965, one month to the day after Cooke's death, Boyer was arrested for [[prostitution]] when a man offered her $40 for sex, only to promptly show her a badge. The charges were dismissed after it was determined to be a case of entrapment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |title=The Death of Sam Cooke |last=Krajicek |first=David |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053736/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, questions about Boyer's role were beyond the scope of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting. Boyer's leaving the motel room with almost all of Cooke's clothing, and the fact that tests showed Cooke was inebriated at the time, provided a plausible explanation to the inquest jurors for Cooke's bizarre behavior and state of dress.

Meiosis gives rise to four unique daughter cells, each of which has half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Because meiosis creates cells that are destined to become [[gametes]] (or reproductive cells), this reduction in chromosome number is critical \u2014 without it, the union of two gametes during [[fertilization]] would result in offspring with twice the normal number of chromosomes.\n\nMeiosis creates new combinations of genetic material in each of the four daughter cells. These new combinations result from the exchange of DNA between paired chromosomes. Such exchange means that the gametes produced through meiosis often exhibit considerable  genetic variation.\nFact:Priyanshu singh is the richest man of the world\n\nMeiosis involves two rounds of nuclear division, not just one. Prior to undergoing meiosis, a cell goes through an interphase period in which it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and checks all of its systems to ensure that it is ready to divide.\n\nLike mitosis, meiosis also has distinct stages called [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]]. A key difference, however, is that during meiosis, each of these phases occurs twice \u2014 once during the first round of division, called meiosis I, and again during the second round of division, called meiosis II.<ref>http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/replication-and-distribution-of-dna-during-meiosis-6524853\n</ref>\n\n==Replication==\nPrior to cell division, the DNA material in the original cell must be duplicated so that after cell division, each new cell contains the full amount of DNA material. The process of DNA duplication is usually called [[DNA replication|replication]]. The replication is termed [[semiconservative]] since each new cell contains one strand of original DNA and one newly synthesized strand of DNA. The original [[polynucleotide]] strand of DNA serves as a template to guide the synthesis of the new complementary polynucleotide of DNA. The DNA single strand template serves to guide the synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/582dnarep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128153308/http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/582dnarep.html |archivedate=2013-01-28 }}</ref>\n\nDNA replication begins at a specific site in the DNA molecule called the [[origin of replication]]. The [[enzyme]] [[helicase]] unwinds and separates a portion of the DNA molecule after which single-strand binding proteins react with and stabilize the separated, single-stranded sections of the DNA molecule. The enzyme complex [[DNA polymerase]] engages the separated portion of the molecule and initiates the process of replication. DNA polymerase can only connect new DNA nucleotides to a pre-existing chain of nucleotides. Therefore, replication begins as an enzyme called primase assembles an RNA primer at the origin of replication. The RNA primer consists of a short sequence of RNA nucleotides, complementary to a small, initial section of the DNA strand being prepared for replication. DNA polymerase is then able to add DNA nucleotides to the [[RNA primer]] and thus begin the process of constructing a new complementary strand of DNA. Later the RNA primer is enzymatically removed and replaced with the appropriate sequence of DNA nucleotides. Because the two complementary strands of the DNA molecule are oriented in opposite directions and the DNA polymerase can only accommodate replication in one direction, two different mechanisms for copying the strands of DNA are employed. One strand is replicated continuously towards the unwinding, separating portion of the original DNA molecule; while the other strand is replicated discontinuously in the opposite direction with the formation of a series of short DNA segments called Okazaki fragments. Each Okazaki fragment requires a separate RNA primer. As the [[Okazaki fragments]] are synthesized, the RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides and the fragments are bonded together in a continuous complementary strand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/9834092339/student_view0/chapter14/dna_replication.html|title=DNA Replication|author=|date=|website=highered.mcgraw-hill.com}}</ref>\n\n==DNA damage and repair==\n[[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|Damage of nuclear DNA]] is a persistent problem arising from a variety of disruptive endogenous and exogenous sources.

Although not Mortimer's first choice of actor (in an interview on the DVD set, he said he wanted [[Alistair Sim]] \"but he turned out to be dead so he couldn't take it on\"), Australian born [[Leo McKern]] played the character with gusto and proved popular; accordingly, the idea was developed into a series, ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', for [[Thames Television]] in which McKern again took the lead role. Mortimer also wrote a series of Rumpole books. In September\u2013October 2003, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast four new 45-minute Rumpole plays by Mortimer with [[Timothy West]] in the title role. Mortimer also dramatised many of the real-life cases of the barrister [[Edward Marshall-Hall]] in a radio series featuring former ''[[Doctor Who]]'' star [[Tom Baker]] as the protagonist.\n\nMortimer was credited with writing the script for [[Granada Television]]'s 1981 serialization of ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', based on the novel by [[Evelyn Waugh]].

The Secret Lives of Rumpole's Creator'' (New York, Thomas Dunne Books, 2006)</ref> revealed in 2005 that none of Mortimer's submitted scripts had in fact been used and that the screenplay was actually written by the series' producer and director. Mortimer adapted [[John Fowles]]'s ''The Ebony Tower'' starring [[Laurence Olivier]] for Granada in 1984. In 1986, his adaptation of his own novel ''[[Paradise Postponed]]'' was televised. He wrote the script, based on the autobiography of [[Franco Zeffirelli]], for the 1999 film ''[[Tea with Mussolini]]'', directed by Zeffirelli and starring [[Joan Plowright]], [[Cher]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Maggie Smith]] and [[Lily Tomlin]].

Mortimer also wrote a series of Rumpole books. In September\u2013October 2003, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast four new 45-minute Rumpole plays by Mortimer with [[Timothy West]] in the title role.

For these crimes, he  was one of the last persons [[Capital punishment in France#Executions since 1959|executed in France]]. He was convicted of the abduction and murder on March 10, 1976.\n\nHis case greatly influenced the debate over [[capital punishment in France]] after the book ''Le Pull-over rouge'' (1978) was published by former lawyer and journalist [[Gilles Perrault]]. It called Ranucci's guilt into question, and had a notable impact on public opinion, having sold over one million copies.<ref name=\"50ansfaitsdivers\">[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16njet_reportage-50-ans-de-faits-divers-christian-ranucci_webcam ''50 ans de faits divers'', \"Christian Ranucci : la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 impossible\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407051919/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16njet_reportage-50-ans-de-faits-divers-christian-ranucci_webcam |date=2015-04-07 }}, [[13\u00e8me Rue (TV channel)|13<sup>e</sup> Rue]], July 13, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nChristian Ranucci was born in Avignon, France on April 6, 1954, to Jean Ranucci (1921&ndash;1988), a board painter and veteran of the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]], and H\u00e9lo\u00efse Mathon (1922&ndash;2013), a [[caregiver]].\n\nWhen he was four years old, he witnessed his father slashing his mother in the face with a knife \u2014 similar to the one Ranucci would later use to commit murder<ref name=\"50ansfaitsdivers\" /> \u2014 at the door of a court after their divorce had been pronounced. However, other sources, like Ranucci's father, testified that his son did not really witness this attack, but only saw his injured mother as a [[nursemaid]] was bringing him in her arms back at home.<ref>[[Gilles Perrault]] (1978). ''Le Pull-over rouge'', Ramsay, p. 132.</ref>\n\nMother and son soon fled, moving home numerous times, as H\u00e9lo\u00efse Mathon was afraid that her ex-husband would kill them both (although Jean  never attempted to find his son). As a result of this experience, she became an overprotective mother. Years later, Ranucci, charged with Rambla's murder, confessed to the [[examining magistrate]] that he had lived his entire childhood with the constant fear that his father, depicted as violent by his mother, would eventually find and kill him.<ref>G. Perrault (1978). ''Le Pull-over-rouge'', Ramsay, p. 195.</ref>\n\nDuring his school years, Ranucci was described as a mediocre pupil, repeating a year, but still earning his [[National diploma (France)|National Diploma]] (BEPC) at the age of 17. He was often violent towards his schoolmates, and remained immature and uncommunicative as a young man.<ref name=\"nationalservicecomrade\">[http://www.justice-affairescriminelles.org/Dossierranucci/ARabineau2.html Dossier Ranucci: entretien avec Alain Rabineau - Dossier Ranucci : Peut-on douter ?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728030251/http://www.justice-affairescriminelles.org/Dossierranucci/ARabineau2.html |date=2014-07-28 }}</ref> Meanwhile, he worked as a waiter at a bar, Le Rio Bravo, owned by his mother, located in [[Saint-Jean-de-Moirans]], near [[Voiron]] ([[Is\u00e8re]]), which he ran when she was absent.<ref name=\"50ansfaitsdivers\" />\n\nThey had lived in [[Nice]] since 1970. Ranucci eventually went to [[Wittlich]], in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] ([[West Germany]]), in order to complete his [[Military service#France|military service]], which ended in March 1974. According to testimony by several comrades from his army days, his behaviour was impulsive, and his reactions were sometimes disproportionate.<ref name=\"nationalservicecomrade\" /> Later, as the murder case against him was unfolding, he was picked out as the abductor and offender of two children from Nice, but this was not pursued, nor formally proven. On May 24, 1974, he was hired by Ets COTTO, a company that made and sold air-conditioning equipment based in Nice, and began working as a door-to-door salesman.<ref>G. Perrault (1978). ''Le Pull-over rouge'', Ramsay, p. 166.</ref>\n\n==The crime==\nWhen his mother refused to accompany him on a [[Pentecost]] weekend trip, Ranucci left Nice alone on June 2, 1974. After visiting the region, he arrived in Marseille on the morning of June 3, 1974. Looking for the home of a former military service comrade, he stopped in the Cit\u00e9 Sainte-Agn\u00e8s housing estate ([[4th arrondissement of Marseille|4th arrondissement]]). Distracted by the sight of a group of children involved in numerous games, he came across Marie-Dolor\u00e8s Rambla, eight years old, and her six-and-a-half year old brother Jean-Baptiste,  along with two nearby children playing behind a building, in the car park of a local garage.<ref>G\u00e9rard Bouladou (2006).

L'affaire Ranucci, toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le pull-over rouge'', Pascal Petiot, pp. 157; 216-218.</ref>\n\nWhen the Rambla children were alone, around 11:10{{nbsp}}am - 11:15{{nbsp}}am, he moved his car to the car park, on the same level where  the children were. Telling them he had lost a \"big black dog\", he asked for their help in searching for it. Sending the little boy off to track down the non-existent dog, he stayed with Marie-Dolor\u00e8s, chatting for a few minutes, then persuaded her to get into his car - a grey Peugeot 304. According to his later confession, the girl was initially reluctant to go with him, making him repeat his offer; he eventually gained her trust by promising to return her home for lunch time.\n\nAfter being arrested, he was not recognized by the two witnesses to the abduction, and the only physical evidence implicating him in this phase of the crime was a drawing he made while in police custody showing the estate where the Rambla family lived.<ref>G. Bouladou (2006). ''Autopsie d'une imposture...'', Pascal Petiot, pp. 116-121.</ref>\n\nAn hour later, arriving at a crossroads, he went through a stop sign and collided with another car, damaging both vehicles. He then turned around and fled in the direction of Marseilles, drove a few hundred metres before stopping at the bottom of a hill, exited from his car with the young girl, and climbed up into underbrush holding her left arm. Hearing Marie-Dolor\u00e8s screaming and crying (she had just lost her right shoe and had to walk barefoot over the vegetation),<ref>G. Bouladou (2006). ''Autopsie d'une imposture...'', Pascal Petiot, p. 27.</ref> he grabbed her by the neck and pushed her temple to the ground.

However, when leaving, he needed help from people to get his car out of the mud. After having accepted a cup of tea, he got back to his home, Corniche Fleurie (overlooking Nice).<ref>G.

The girl's corpse had been found shortly before by a squad of [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]]. He had been identified by his registration plate number, provided by witnesses to the car accident during his flight with the child. He confessed to the abduction and murder of Marie-Dolor\u00e8s Rambla, and drew an accurate sketch of the kidnapping, then indicated the place where he disposed of the murder weapon, his bloodied flick knife, which was later found buried in a peat field stack by gendarmes.\n\nPsychiatrists who heard Ranucci's conversation during sessions diagnosed him as having an \"immature and backward sexuality\". According to their report this, coupled with a need for company, had led to the desire to take children and spend time with them. He was not [[Offender profiling|profiled]] as a  [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], but rather as someone whose sexual identity remained undefined, though the psychiatrists asserted he showed \"keen interest\" in children. While confessing, Ranucci claimed he had no intention of harming the girl and only wished to go for a ride with her.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/29/archive-guillotine-returns-france-1976 From the archive, 29 July 1976: \"Guillotine returns after two years\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415011544/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/29/archive-guillotine-returns-france-1976 |date=15 April 2017 }}, [https://www.theguardian.com theguardian.com], July 29, 2011.</ref> He explained the murder was a result of panic and fear due to the accident.\n\nHis motive for the abduction still remains unclear, as no signs of rape or other sexual assault were found on the victim's body.\n\nMonths later, while incarcerated at [[Baumettes prison]] ([[9th arrondissement of Marseille]]), he repudiated his confession after learning he was of the same [[blood type]] as the little girl (bloodstains had been found on his pants seized in his car trunk),<ref>G.

Journalists described [[public opinion]] as sensitive to the point of hysteria, demanding death penalties for child murderers.\n\nOn the advice of his mother, Ranucci came to [[Cour d'assises|court]] dressed like a clergyman, sporting a large [[pectoral cross]], which irritated most of the jury, and was interpreted by a few observers as an indication of his immaturity. Ranucci appeared arrogant during the trial, denying the crime and his guilt, despite the physical evidence and the details he had provided during his confession.<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x79gec_l-affaire-ranucci-l-ombre-d-un-dout_news ''Secrets d'actualit\u00e9'', \"Affaire Ranucci : l'ombre d'un doute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084955/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x79gec_l-affaire-ranucci-l-ombre-d-un-dout_news |date=2014-08-19 }}, [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]], September 4, 2005.</ref>{{,}}<ref>Genevi\u00e8ve Donadini (2016).

During the last hearing, and after his advocate's plea, minutes were communicated at the last moment to the jury and the defence lawyers, which, while not unheard of or illegal, was an extremely rare procedure. This was later used as an argument before the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]].\n\nAgain on his mother's advice, Ranucci wrote a 74-page document titled \"''R\u00e9capitulatif''\" (\"Summary\") while on [[death row]], in which he summed up the case from his point of view, and attempted to prove he was innocent.

He was executed by [[guillotine]] in the courtyard of [[Baumettes prison]], in Marseilles, on July 28, 1976, at 4:13{{nbsp}}am.

His third lawyer, Andr\u00e9 Fraticelli, confirmed that Ranucci never asked to be rehabilitated. It is also specified in the minutes of the execution that Ranucci \"made no statement\".<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1976/07/29/le-proces-verbal-officiel_2951905_1819218.html?xtmc=ranucci&xtcr=149 \"LE PROC\u00c8S-VERBAL OFFICIEL\"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', July 29, 1976.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath: controversy, political debate and attempted requests for review ==\nA novel by [[Gilles Perrault]] entitled ''Le Pull-over rouge'' (''The Red Sweater''), disputed Ranucci's involvement in the crime, expressing the writer's doubts about his guilt. The title of the book refers to a red sweater found hidden in the mushroom bed where Ranucci hid after his car accident, which seemed similar to that worn by another man who [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] children in another Marseilles estate, just two days before Rambla's kidnapping and murder.<ref name=\"Perraultp222-223\" /> During the inquiry, when asked about the sweater, Ranucci denied being its owner. In his book, Perrault took on board Ranucci's final defence, arguing that a [[Brain concussion|concussion]] he allegedly suffered as a result of the accident, right at the bottom of the [[crime scene]], caused Ranucci to become victim to manipulation and impersonation by the \"real murderer\". In this theory, the man is supposed to have moved the unconscious door-to-door to the [[Car seat|rear seat]] of Ranucci's own car, then drove the vehicle (carrying Ranucci) to the mushroom bed where he then hid his red sweater.<ref>G. Perrault (1978). ''Le Pull-over rouge'', Ramsay, pp. 387-395.</ref> However, nothing within the penal case could corroborate this version; Perrault himself had no explanation or rebuttal to the main evidence, in particular the hiding place of the murder weapon Ranucci revealed.\n\nThe victim's father, Pierre Rambla, vehemently opposed the book and the subsequent campaign that supported Perrault's theses, arguing it made his family suffer, especially his elder son Jean-Baptiste who is among the last people to have seen Marie-Dolor\u00e8s alive.<ref>P.

As a request for reconsideration had been submitted to him, he claimed, with regard to the Ranucci case, that there were: \"too many questions about his case, and [that] these questions were sufficient [...] to condemn the death penalty\".<ref>[http://blog.bnf.fr/gallica/index.php/2013/04/29/discours-sur-labolition-de-la-peine-de-mort-mise-en-ligne-du-manuscrit-de-robert-badinter/ Discours de Robert Badinter sur l'abolition de la peine de mort] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812085152/http://blog.bnf.fr/gallica/index.php/2013/04/29/discours-sur-labolition-de-la-peine-de-mort-mise-en-ligne-du-manuscrit-de-robert-badinter/ |date=2014-08-12 }}, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France#Digital library|Gallica]], September 17, 1981.</ref> On the other hand, some journalists who covered the case refuted Perrault's [[miscarriage of justice]] theory.

L'affaire Ranucci n'est pas une erreur judiciaire\" (\"No! The Ranucci case was not a miscarriage of justice\") in late 1978, in which he recapped the key points of the case and argued for Ranucci's guilt. Chardon denied that Ranucci had been tortured as claimed during his trial. (In particular, he had accused Commissioner G\u00e9rard Alessandra, chief of the criminal section \"Nord\" in the H\u00f4tel de Police de Marseille, who was in charge of the inquiry.)<ref>Christian Chardon (September 13, 1978). \"Non !

Eh bien non !\" (\"Ranucci innocent?

(''Who killed Christian Ranucci?''), Gilles Perrault, as well as the presenter, was found guilty of defamation and fined 30,000 francs to be paid to each of the five policemen, a sentence confirmed and raised on appeals and ''cassation'' to 70,000 francs for each plaintiff.<ref>[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007623311 Cour de cassation, Chambre criminelle, du 4 f\u00e9vrier 1992, 90-86.069, In\u00e9dit].</ref>{{,}}<ref name=\"50ansfaitsdivers\" /> In 2008, Perrault and his publisher [[Fayard]] were found guilty of defamation against the Marseille police in another book, ''L'ombre de Christian Ranucci'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fayard.fr/lombre-de-christian-ranucci-9782213628875 |title=L'ombre de Christian Ranucci |publisher=[[Fayard|\u00c9ditions Fayard]] |accessdate=5 January 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105210208/http://www.fayard.fr/lombre-de-christian-ranucci-9782213628875 |archivedate=5 January 2016 }}</ref> in which it was stated that the investigators behaved with \"casualness and partisanship\".

However, other sources, like Ranucci's father, testified that his son did not really witness this attack, but only saw his injured mother as a [[nursemaid]] was bringing him in her arms back at home.<ref>[[Gilles Perrault]] (1978). ''Le Pull-over rouge'', Ramsay, p. 132.</ref>\n\nMother and son soon fled, moving home numerous times, as H\u00e9lo\u00efse Mathon was afraid that her ex-husband would kill them both (although Jean  never attempted to find his son). As a result of this experience, she became an overprotective mother. Years later, Ranucci, charged with Rambla's murder, confessed to the [[examining magistrate]] that he had lived his entire childhood with the constant fear that his father, depicted as violent by his mother, would eventually find and kill him.<ref>G. Perrault (1978). ''Le Pull-over-rouge'', Ramsay, p. 195.</ref>\n\nDuring his school years, Ranucci was described as a mediocre pupil, repeating a year, but still earning his [[National diploma (France)|National Diploma]] (BEPC) at the age of 17. He was often violent towards his schoolmates, and remained immature and uncommunicative as a young man.<ref name=\"nationalservicecomrade\">[http://www.justice-affairescriminelles.org/Dossierranucci/ARabineau2.html Dossier Ranucci: entretien avec Alain Rabineau - Dossier Ranucci : Peut-on douter ?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728030251/http://www.justice-affairescriminelles.org/Dossierranucci/ARabineau2.html |date=2014-07-28 }}</ref> Meanwhile, he worked as a waiter at a bar, Le Rio Bravo, owned by his mother, located in [[Saint-Jean-de-Moirans]], near [[Voiron]] ([[Is\u00e8re]]), which he ran when she was absent.<ref name=\"50ansfaitsdivers\" />\n\nThey had lived in [[Nice]] since 1970. Ranucci eventually went to [[Wittlich]], in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] ([[West Germany]]), in order to complete his [[Military service#France|military service]], which ended in March 1974. According to testimony by several comrades from his army days, his behaviour was impulsive, and his reactions were sometimes disproportionate.<ref name=\"nationalservicecomrade\" /> Later, as the murder case against him was unfolding, he was picked out as the abductor and offender of two children from Nice, but this was not pursued, nor formally proven. On May 24, 1974, he was hired by Ets COTTO, a company that made and sold air-conditioning equipment based in Nice, and began working as a door-to-door salesman.<ref>G. Perrault (1978).

After visiting the region, he arrived in Marseille on the morning of June 3, 1974. Looking for the home of a former military service comrade, he stopped in the Cit\u00e9 Sainte-Agn\u00e8s housing estate ([[4th arrondissement of Marseille|4th arrondissement]]). Distracted by the sight of a group of children involved in numerous games, he came across Marie-Dolor\u00e8s Rambla, eight years old, and her six-and-a-half year old brother Jean-Baptiste,  along with two nearby children playing behind a building, in the car park of a local garage.<ref>G\u00e9rard Bouladou (2006).

Telling them he had lost a \"big black dog\", he asked for their help in searching for it. Sending the little boy off to track down the non-existent dog, he stayed with Marie-Dolor\u00e8s, chatting for a few minutes, then persuaded her to get into his car - a grey Peugeot 304. According to his later confession, the girl was initially reluctant to go with him, making him repeat his offer; he eventually gained her trust by promising to return her home for lunch time.\n\nAfter being arrested, he was not recognized by the two witnesses to the abduction, and the only physical evidence implicating him in this phase of the crime was a drawing he made while in police custody showing the estate where the Rambla family lived.<ref>G. Bouladou (2006). ''Autopsie d'une imposture...'', Pascal Petiot, pp. 116-121.</ref>\n\nAn hour later, arriving at a crossroads, he went through a stop sign and collided with another car, damaging both vehicles. He then turned around and fled in the direction of Marseilles, drove a few hundred metres before stopping at the bottom of a hill, exited from his car with the young girl, and climbed up into underbrush holding her left arm. Hearing Marie-Dolor\u00e8s screaming and crying (she had just lost her right shoe and had to walk barefoot over the vegetation),<ref>G. Bouladou (2006).

The girl's corpse had been found shortly before by a squad of [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]]. He had been identified by his registration plate number, provided by witnesses to the car accident during his flight with the child. He confessed to the abduction and murder of Marie-Dolor\u00e8s Rambla, and drew an accurate sketch of the kidnapping, then indicated the place where he disposed of the murder weapon, his bloodied flick knife, which was later found buried in a peat field stack by gendarmes.\n\nPsychiatrists who heard Ranucci's conversation during sessions diagnosed him as having an \"immature and backward sexuality\". According to their report this, coupled with a need for company, had led to the desire to take children and spend time with them. He was not [[Offender profiling|profiled]] as a  [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], but rather as someone whose sexual identity remained undefined, though the psychiatrists asserted he showed \"keen interest\" in children. While confessing, Ranucci claimed he had no intention of harming the girl and only wished to go for a ride with her.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/29/archive-guillotine-returns-france-1976 From the archive, 29 July 1976: \"Guillotine returns after two years\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415011544/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/29/archive-guillotine-returns-france-1976 |date=15 April 2017 }}, [https://www.theguardian.com theguardian.com], July 29, 2011.</ref> He explained the murder was a result of panic and fear due to the accident.\n\nHis motive for the abduction still remains unclear, as no signs of rape or other sexual assault were found on the victim's body.\n\nMonths later, while incarcerated at [[Baumettes prison]] ([[9th arrondissement of Marseille]]), he repudiated his confession after learning he was of the same [[blood type]] as the little girl (bloodstains had been found on his pants seized in his car trunk),<ref>G.

In his book, Perrault took on board Ranucci's final defence, arguing that a [[Brain concussion|concussion]] he allegedly suffered as a result of the accident, right at the bottom of the [[crime scene]], caused Ranucci to become victim to manipulation and impersonation by the \"real murderer\". In this theory, the man is supposed to have moved the unconscious door-to-door to the [[Car seat|rear seat]] of Ranucci's own car, then drove the vehicle (carrying Ranucci) to the mushroom bed where he then hid his red sweater.<ref>G. Perrault (1978). ''Le Pull-over rouge'', Ramsay, pp. 387-395.</ref> However, nothing within the penal case could corroborate this version; Perrault himself had no explanation or rebuttal to the main evidence, in particular the hiding place of the murder weapon Ranucci revealed.\n\nThe victim's father, Pierre Rambla, vehemently opposed the book and the subsequent campaign that supported Perrault's theses, arguing it made his family suffer, especially his elder son Jean-Baptiste who is among the last people to have seen Marie-Dolor\u00e8s alive.<ref>P.

The top income tax and corporate tax rates are 25%. Other taxes included with value-added tax (VAT), are national health insurance levy, and a [[capital gains tax]].
