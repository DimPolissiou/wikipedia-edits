{"title_page": "History of the chair", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Chair]]s are known from [[Ancient Egypt]] and have been widespread in the Western world from the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] onwards. They were in common use in [[Imperial China|China]] from the twelfth century, and were used by the [[Aztecs]]. \n\nSurviving examples of chairs from medieval Europe are often ornate works associated with royalty and nobility. During the [[Renaissance]], chairs came into more common use, their design reflecting the changing costumes and furnishings of the period. Distinctive designs developed in France and England. In modern times the range of chair designs and materials has increased enormously.\n\n==Egyptian chairs==\n[[File:Hetepheres chair.jpg|250px|thumb|The chair of [[Hetepheres I]], the mother of [[Khufu]]]]\n\nEgyptian [[Egypt|chairs]].{{when?|date=April 2019}}<ref>[http://www.furniturestyles.net/ancient/egyptian/ Ancient Egyptian Furniture in Egypt]</ref> appear to have been of great richness and splendour. Fashioned of [[ebony]] and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood and metal, they were covered with costly materials and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives.\n\nEgyptians believed that the chairs need to represent natural forms to avoid creating chaos in the universe, by creating an artificial object. This tendency is seen all over Egyptian art and manufacture. {{Citation needed |date=August 2013}}\nAn arm-chair in fine preservation found in a tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] is astonishingly similar, even in small details, to that \"[[Empire style]]\" which followed [[Napoleon]]'s campaign in Egypt. The earliest monuments of [[Nineveh]] represent a chair without a back but with tastefully carved legs ending in lions' claws or bulls' hoofs.  Others are supported by figures in the nature of [[caryatid]]es or by animals.\n\n==Greek and Roman chairs==\n[[File:Tombstone Xanthippos BM Sc628.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Klismos chair]], with curved backrest and tapering, outcurved legs, on the [[stele]] of Xanthippos, Athens, ca. 430-20 BCE]]\n[[File:Gynaeceum scene Louvre MN558.jpg|thumb|left|A woman on a chair, side A of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured]] [[loutrophoros]], ca. 400 BC. From Benghazi, [[Cyrenaica]], [[Louvre]] Museum, Paris.]]\nThe earliest known form of [[Greece|Greek]] chair dates back to six or seven centuries BCE. On the [[Parthenon Frieze|frieze of the Parthenon]], [[Zeus]] occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned legs; it is ornamented with winged [[sphinx]]es and the feet of beasts. The characteristic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] chairs were of [[marble]], also adorned with sphinxes.  The [[curule chair]] was originally very similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually received a good deal of ornament.\nThe most famous of the very few chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed [[Chair of Saint Peter]] in [[St Peter's Basilica]] at [[Rome]]. The wooden portions are much decayed, but it would appear to be [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient [[sedia gestatoria]]. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, [[Gregorovius]] says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions\u2019 heads and winged figures of Victory (or [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the end of the 18th century.\n\n==Mexican chairs==\nOne type of chair in ancient Mexico is called the [[icpalli]] and is mentioned by [[Jacques Soustelle]]. {{cite book |title=The Daily Life of the Aztecs|page=122}} The icpalli can be seen in Diego Rivera's mural of the [[Aztec]] market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], Palacio Nacional, [[Mexico City]]. The icpalli is also featured in the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]]; dignitaries and emperors are depicted sitting in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/artefacts/aztec-high-chair |title=Aztec high-chair? |publisher=Mexicolore.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval chairs==\n[[File:Walraversijde09.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seigneurial chairs at a table with tin cutlery, pottery, medieval glass and earthenware in majolica, c. 1465]]\nThe chair of [[Maximian]] in the cathedral of [[Ravenna]] is believed to date from the middle of the 6th century.

Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nAlthough English furniture derives so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped [[splat (furniture)|splat]] and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. [[George Hepplewhite]], [[Thomas Sheraton]] and [[Robert Adam]] all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of [[Thomas Chippendale]], remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.\n\n18th-century chairs\n[[File:FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A reading of [[Moli\u00e8re]]'', [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy]], about 1728]]\nInformal, ''galante'' manners and a new half-reclining posture that replaced the former bolt-upright demeanor of court and aristocracy in the age of Louis XIV went hand-in-hand with new commodious seat furniture, developed in Paris about 1720 (''illustration, right''). The new [[Rococo]] chairs were upholstered ''\u00e0 chassis'', on removable frames secured by clips, so that changes from winter to summer furniture could be effected without recourse to the ''menuisier''.  Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the ''garde-meuble''. These early Louis XV chairs have backs upholstered '''''\u00e0 la reine''''', with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the ''boiserie'' panels behind them.\n\nIn the illustration, the symmetrical cusped and scrolling seatrails that flow into stubby '''[[cabriole leg]]s''' of these comfortable low armchairs (''chauffeuses'') have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).\n\n[[File:19th century American Armchair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|American Armchair (1850-1863) made of Rosewood, rosewood veneer, pine, and chestnut. Attributed to [[John Henry Belter]]. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nFrench fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable \"Louis XV\" French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into '''cabriole legs''' that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict [[guild]] regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the ''menuisier'' alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (''huissier''), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable ''[[berg\u00e8re]]'' (\"shepherdess\") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes ''rechampi en blanc'') or left in the natural color (''\u00e1 la capuchine''), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded ''boiseries'' for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Li\u00e8ge all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SothebysChairs1a.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]] -->\n\n[[File:ChairPhoto1369.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]]\nIn the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] chairs were made, even before the accession of [[Louis XVI]], whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sen\u00e9 and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.\n\nThe 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including [[Colonial America]]), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] could not refrain from writing of them in his [[Encyclop\u00e9die]]. The typical [[Louis XVI style|Louis Seize style]] chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] or [[Watteau]]-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.\n\nThough some stories attribute its invention to [[Benjamin Franklin]], historians trace the [[rocking chair]]'s origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century.\n\n==19th-century chairs==\nThe [[art nouveau]] school produced chairs of simplicity. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the [[Michael Thonet]] Bendwood chair or the bistro chair, created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today.\n\n==20th-century and modern chairs==\nThe 20th century saw an increasing use of iPads in chair construction with such things as all-metal [[folding chairs]], metal-legged chairs, the [[Streit Slumber Chair|Slumber Chair]], moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), [[butterfly chair]], [[beanbag chairs]], the egg or [[pod chair]], plywood and laminate wood chairs, and [[massage chair]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facilitysolutionsplus.com/blog/2019/3/13/ergonomic-chairs-how-to-choose-the-best-chair-for-you |title=Ergonomic Chairs |accessdate=2019-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujiiryoki.com/eng/history/|title=History of Massage Chairs|website=www.fujiiryoki.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Belanger|first1=Christian|title=New Exhibit Gives American Chair Design Its Due Respect|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/arts-culture/February-2018/Catherine-Shotick/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berg\u00e8re]]\n*[[Watchman's chair]]\n*[[Windsor chair]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Chair |volume=5 |pages=801\u2013802}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentchair.com/product/raani-chair/ Rani Chair] - Galleries of ancient chairs\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Witold Rybczynski |title=Now I Sit Me Down: From Klismos to Plastic Chair: A Natural History |year=2017 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374537036}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Chair}}\n[[Category:Chairs|*]]\n[[Category:Cultural history|Chair]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Chair]]s are known from [[Ancient Egypt]] and have been widespread in the Western world from the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] onwards. They were in common use in [[Imperial China|China]] from the twelfth century, and were used by the [[Aztecs]]. \n\nSurviving examples of chairs from medieval Europe are often ornate works associated with royalty and nobility. During the [[Renaissance]], chairs came into more common use, their design reflecting the changing costumes and furnishings of the period. Distinctive designs developed in France and England. In modern times the range of chair designs and materials has increased enormously.\n\n==Egyptian chairs==\n[[File:Hetepheres chair.jpg|250px|thumb|The chair of [[Hetepheres I]], the mother of [[Khufu]]]]\n\nEgyptian [[Egypt|chairs]].{{when?|date=April 2019}}<ref>[http://www.furniturestyles.net/ancient/egyptian/ Ancient Egyptian Furniture in Egypt]</ref> appear to have been of great richness and splendour. Fashioned of [[ebony]] and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood and metal, they were covered with costly materials and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives.\n\nEgyptians believed that the chairs need to represent natural forms to avoid creating chaos in the universe, by creating an artificial object. This tendency is seen all over Egyptian art and manufacture. {{Citation needed |date=August 2013}}\nAn arm-chair in fine preservation found in a tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] is astonishingly similar, even in small details, to that \"[[Empire style]]\" which followed [[Napoleon]]'s campaign in Egypt. The earliest monuments of [[Nineveh]] represent a chair without a back but with tastefully carved legs ending in lions' claws or bulls' hoofs.  Others are supported by figures in the nature of [[caryatid]]es or by animals.\n\n==Greek and Roman chairs==\n[[File:Tombstone Xanthippos BM Sc628.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Klismos chair]], with curved backrest and tapering, outcurved legs, on the [[stele]] of Xanthippos, Athens, ca. 430-20 BCE]]\n[[File:Gynaeceum scene Louvre MN558.jpg|thumb|left|A woman on a chair, side A of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured]] [[loutrophoros]], ca. 400 BC.

On the [[Parthenon Frieze|frieze of the Parthenon]], [[Zeus]] occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned legs; it is ornamented with winged [[sphinx]]es and the feet of beasts. The characteristic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] chairs were of [[marble]], also adorned with sphinxes.  The [[curule chair]] was originally very similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually received a good deal of ornament.\nThe most famous of the very few chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed [[Chair of Saint Peter]] in [[St Peter's Basilica]] at [[Rome]]. The wooden portions are much decayed, but it would appear to be [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient [[sedia gestatoria]]. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, [[Gregorovius]] says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions\u2019 heads and winged figures of Victory (or [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the end of the 18th century.\n\n==Mexican chairs==\nOne type of chair in ancient Mexico is called the [[icpalli]] and is mentioned by [[Jacques Soustelle]]. {{cite book |title=The Daily Life of the Aztecs|page=122}} The icpalli can be seen in Diego Rivera's mural of the [[Aztec]] market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], Palacio Nacional, [[Mexico City]].

Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the ''garde-meuble''. These early Louis XV chairs have backs upholstered '''''\u00e0 la reine''''', with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the ''boiserie'' panels behind them.\n\nIn the illustration, the symmetrical cusped and scrolling seatrails that flow into stubby '''[[cabriole leg]]s''' of these comfortable low armchairs (''chauffeuses'') have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).\n\n[[File:19th century American Armchair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|American Armchair (1850-1863) made of Rosewood, rosewood veneer, pine, and chestnut. Attributed to [[John Henry Belter]]. Part of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] collection.]]\nFrench fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable \"Louis XV\" French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into '''cabriole legs''' that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict [[guild]] regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the ''menuisier'' alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (''huissier''), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable ''[[berg\u00e8re]]'' (\"shepherdess\") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes ''rechampi en blanc'') or left in the natural color (''\u00e1 la capuchine''), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded ''boiseries'' for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Li\u00e8ge all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SothebysChairs1a.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]] -->\n\n[[File:ChairPhoto1369.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by [[Georges Jacob]].]]\nIn the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] chairs were made, even before the accession of [[Louis XVI]], whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sen\u00e9 and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.\n\nThe 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including [[Colonial America]]), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] could not refrain from writing of them in his [[Encyclop\u00e9die]]. The typical [[Louis XVI style|Louis Seize style]] chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] or [[Watteau]]-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.\n\nThough some stories attribute its invention to [[Benjamin Franklin]], historians trace the [[rocking chair]]'s origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century.\n\n==19th-century chairs==\nThe [[art nouveau]] school produced chairs of simplicity. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the [[Michael Thonet]] Bendwood chair or the bistro chair, created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today.\n\n==20th-century and modern chairs==\nThe 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal [[folding chairs]], metal-legged chairs, the [[Streit Slumber Chair|Slumber Chair]], moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), [[butterfly chair]], [[beanbag chairs]], the egg or [[pod chair]], plywood and laminate wood chairs, and [[massage chair]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facilitysolutionsplus.com/blog/2019/3/13/ergonomic-chairs-how-to-choose-the-best-chair-for-you |title=Ergonomic Chairs |accessdate=2019-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujiiryoki.com/eng/history/|title=History of Massage Chairs|website=www.fujiiryoki.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Belanger|first1=Christian|title=New Exhibit Gives American Chair Design Its Due Respect|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/arts-culture/February-2018/Catherine-Shotick/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berg\u00e8re]]\n*[[Watchman's chair]]\n*[[Windsor chair]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Chair |volume=5 |pages=801\u2013802}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentchair.com/product/raani-chair/ Rani Chair] - Galleries of ancient chairs\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Witold Rybczynski |title=Now I Sit Me Down: From Klismos to Plastic Chair: A Natural History |year=2017 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374537036}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Chair}}\n[[Category:Chairs|*]]\n[[Category:Cultural history|Chair]]\n", "name_user": "TheKidFromNextDoor", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e20th-century and modern chairs)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_chair"}

{"title_page": "DNA virus", "text_new": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Twelve families are currently recognised.\n\n* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Classification===\nA division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.<ref name=Rosario2009/> This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nType I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS DNA viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Anelloviridae'', all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains.<ref name=Krupovic2013>Krupovic M (2013) \"Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses\".

The ''Bidnaviridae'' have a two part genome and infect invertebrates. The ''Inoviridae'' and ''Microviridae'' infect [[bacteria]]; the ''Anelloviridae'' and ''Circoviridae'' infect [[animal]]s ([[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s respectively); and the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' infect [[plant]]s. In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication. This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the host's own [[DNA polymerase]].\n\n===Recently classified viruses===\n\nIn the 9th edition of the viral taxonomy of the ICTV (published 2011) the Bombyx mori densovirus type 2 was placed in a new family\u2014the ''[[Bidnaviridae]]'' on the basis of its genome structure and replication mechanism.

The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation.

This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:DNA viruses| ]]\n[[Category:DNA]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity.

This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an
