Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cars and cows vent half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey, but a fifth is absorbed by trees.

Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport.

[[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cars and cows vent half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey, but a fifth is absorbed by trees.

Developed from the [[Saro P.531]], it served as a land-based general purpose military helicopter, sharing a common ancestor and numerous components with the naval-orientated [[Westland Wasp]] helicopter. The type's primary operator was the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] of the [[British Army]], which operated it in several conflict zones including [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Falklands War]].\n\n==Development==\nBoth the Scout and the Wasp were developed from the [[Saro P.531|Saunders-Roe P.531]], itself a development of the [[Saunders-Roe Skeeter]]. With the acquisition of Saunders Roe, Westland took over the P.531 project, which became the prototype for the Scout (originally called Sprite) and the Wasp. The initial [[Ministry of Defence (1947\u201364)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) development contract was for a five to six seat general purpose helicopter.{{sfn|Flight International|1960|p=349}}\n\nThe first version that met both RN and Army requirement, the P.531-2, flew on 9 August 1959 with a [[Bristol Siddeley Nimbus]] engine. A [[de Havilland Gnome]] engine-equipped version was also trialled, starting 3 May 1960. The production Scout AH.1 used a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] Nimbus engine (RR having acquired Bristol Siddeley by then). The engine was rated at {{convert|1050|shp|abbr=on}}, but the torque was limited to {{convert|685|shp|abbr=on}}. Extensive theoretical design and practical testing was carried out to provide an undercarriage that was tolerant to [[ground resonance]]. The first Army Scout AH Mk 1 flew on 4 August 1960, a powered-controls version followed in March 1961 and deliveries started in early 1963. Following trials ranging from Canada to Nairobi, the airframe was released for operations between \u221226C and [[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]+30C.{{sfn|Flight International|1963|p=232}}{{sfn|Stevens|1964|pp=183\u2013186,189}}\n\n==Design==\nBehind the two front seats was a three-seat bench, although this could be replaced with a four-seat bench when fitted with modified rear doors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was used for general light work, including observation, liaison, training and search & rescue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} When fitted as a light attack helicopter, it carried either two, skid-mounted, forward-firing machine gun ([[FN MAG|L8A1 General Purpose Machine Gun]]) packs or a single pintle-mounted machine gun in the rear cabin.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|p=33}} The pintle mount was available in both port and starboard mountings.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|pp=34\u201335}} The gun-packs, which were both aimed at a pre-set convergence angle, carried 200 rounds of ammunition and were mounted on a tubular spar that was fixed between the front and rear undercarriage legs.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|pp=33\u201335}} In the anti-tank role, it could carry four guided missiles (the [[Nord SS.11]]).{{sfn|Ferguson|1982}} The sighting unit was the AF.120, the result of a joint venture between [[Avimo]] and Ferranti, had x2.5 and x10 magnification.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Flight International |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200191.html |last=Bentley|first=John |date=4 February 1971 |title=Through a glass, steadily |pages=176\u2013177 }}</ref> The APX Bezu sight unit was also evaluated but rejected, although it was adopted for use on the Westland Wasp.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} \n[[File:Scout with SS.11s-3.jpg|thumbnail|right|SS.11 equipped Scout of 3 CBAS in 1978]]\nAdditional testing and trials were carried out with the [[Swingfire]] anti-tank guided missile.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%203111.html |magazine=Flight International |date=23 November 1972 |title=photo caption |page=734 }}</ref> Initial firings were carried out in early 1972, to test the \"Hawkswing\" system for the [[Westland Lynx]], the associated AF.530 gyro-stabilized sight<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%200421.html|title=Defence: Hawkswing sight delivered |magazine=Flight International |date=21 March 1974 |page=363}}</ref> was subsequently trialled in 1974.

In the casualty evacuation role (CASEVAC), the Scout could carry two stretchers internally or two on externally mounted pods, the co-pilot's seat could also be reversed to allow an attendant to face the casualties.\n\nAlthough the general design of the aircraft was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the cabin heater switch being mounted next to the fuel cock; this led to the loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the fuel cock instead of switching off the cabin heater, causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.flyingmarines.com/Biographies/1961-1970/Streeter.htm |title=Alan Streeter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028120603/http://www.flyingmarines.com/Biographies/1961-1970/Streeter.htm |archivedate=28 October 2010 |website= flyingmarines.com}}</ref> In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire.

Engine problems delayed the introduction of the Scout until 1963, and as an interim measure the Army Air Corps received a small number of [[Alouette II]] helicopters. Although the aircraft's entry into service was delayed, the Scout still had a number of teething troubles when it was introduced. One of the earliest losses was XR596, which crashed into the jungle near Kluang airfield in southern Malaya on 16 July 1964, following a fuel pump failure. The two crew died in the incident. Engine failures were responsible for the loss of at least 11 military and civilian registered aircraft. The engine life of the Nimbus during the early part of its service was notoriously low, with four to six flying hours being the norm. A competition was allegedly held, with a prize to the first unit that could achieve an engine life of 25 flying hours. Operational experience and development work steadily improved the reliability of the Nimbus and by 1964 engine life had improved to two or three engine changes per 1,000 flying hours.\n\nThe Scout AH Mk 1 was operated by the Army Air Corps on general light work, including observation and liaison. Like the Wasp, the Scout could be fitted out with different role equipment including flotation gear and a Lucas air-driven hoist which had a lift capacity of {{convert|600|lb|abbr=on}}. In the light attack role, it was capable of carrying one pintle machine gun in the rear cabin (it is possible to carry two pintle-mounted GPMGs in the cabin, although this would, unsurprisingly, be somewhat cramped) or two forward-firing 7.62mm L7 General Purpose Machine Guns ([[GPMG]]s) fixed to the undercarriage skid. These GPMG combinations were sometimes used in unison to great effect.\n\nThe forward firing GPMGs were electrically operated, being fired by the pilot and aimed using a rudimentary system of drawing a small cross on the windscreen with a chinagraph pencil. In sandy conditions, these weapons could jam, which necessitated one of the free crew leaning out of the cockpit door and 'booting' the offending weapon in the hope of clearing it. This procedure was not strictly in accordance with the flight reference cards. The [[L7A1]] pintle-mounted weapon was operated by a door gunner.\n[[File:Westland Scout XR628 Habilayn.jpg|thumb|right|8 Flight Scout AH.1 at Habilayn, Radfan 1967]]\nIn the anti-tank role, four [[SS.11]] ATGWs were carried; these could be carried in conjunction with the pintle-mounted GPMG. During the Falklands campaign, the SS.11 achieved some success, being used to attack Argentine positions on 14 June 1982. For night time reconnaissance, the Scout could carry four {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on}} parachute flares mounted on special carriers. In addition, two smaller parachute flares could be carried to allow emergency landings at night. These were fitted on the starboard rear fuselage on a special attachment point. About 150 Scout helicopters were acquired for the Army Air Corps, which operated them until 1994.\n\nThe way British military aviation has been established has meant that the [[Royal Marines]] have never actually \"owned\" their own aircraft. The larger [[Westland Whirlwind (helicopter)|Whirlwind]], [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] and [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] <nowiki/>have been [[Fleet Air Arm|Royal Navy]] helicopters and, like today's [[Westland Lynx#Land-based variants|Lynx AH Mk 7]], the Scout AH Mk 1s operated by [[3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron]] (3 CBAS) were British Army helicopters on loan. 3 CBAS flew the Scout from 1971 through to 1982, when it was replaced by the Westland Lynx, and the squadron was eventually renumbered as [[847 Naval Air Squadron]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/fleet-air-arm/helicopter-squadrons/wildcat/847-naval-air-squadron/847-affiliations 847 NAS Affiliations]</ref>\n\nThe Scout saw operational service in [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Borneo]], [[Aden Emergency|Aden]], Oman, Rhodesia, Northern Ireland and then in the South Atlantic.\n\nThe Territorial Army (AAC) formed 666 Squadron with a number of Scouts in the late 1980s.\n\n===Borneo===\nMystery still surrounds a Scout that went missing 20 September 1965.<ref>[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650923.2.4.aspx Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: XR599 \u2013 Was missing helicopter hijacked?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320231259/http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650923.2.4.aspx |date=20 March 2012 }}</ref>\n''XR599'' set off for a {{convert|40|nmi|km|adj=on}} night flight from Lundu to Kuching, the mission being to transport a local communist suspect to the Sarawak capital for interrogation. At 23:00 hrs, the aircraft was posted as missing and a search and rescue mission was mounted. Although the aircraft and the remains of the pilot, the escort rifleman and the suspect were never found, a fisherman later dredged up small parts of the aircraft wreckage. On 23 September, a local newspaper, ''The Strait Times'', printed a story speculating that the Scout had been hi-jacked by the prisoner who had somehow managed to capture his escort's weapon and then ordered the pilot to either fly out to sea or over the jungle towards the Indonesian border until they ran out of fuel. Tragedy struck a second time on 25 September when an RAF Westland Whirlwind HAR.10 of 225 Sqn, searching over jungle for ''XR599'', crashed killing the five crew.<ref>[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19650927.2.2&sessionid=417242aa9fbc4d7fa439c4975c8a9d23 Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: 5 Die in Copter Crash in Sarawak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403153933/http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19650927.2.2&sessionid=417242aa9fbc4d7fa439c4975c8a9d23 |date=3 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Aden and Radfan===\nIn Aden and Radfan, a number of Scouts were shot down, although these usually resulted in a forced landing and the aircraft were recovered, repaired and returned to service. An example of this occurred on 26 May 1964 when the CO of [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|3 Para]], Lt Col [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43641 |supp=y |page=4347 |date=30 April 1965 }}</ref> used a Scout to reconnoitre the Wadi Dhubsan area, Radfan. The aircraft was hit by enemy fire<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43641 |supp=y |page=4348| date=30 April 1965 }}</ref> and the pilot made an emergency landing behind enemy lines. The aircraft was subsequently recovered; Farrar-Hockley rejoined the unit and was awarded the Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for his leadership. Three Scouts were written off during the campaign, the first, ''XR634'', was through pilot error whilst landing on 16 May 1966. Although initially repairable, this aircraft was subsequently damaged beyond economic repair when it was dropped by the RAF Westland Wessex sent to recover it. The second aircraft, ''XT635'', flew into a hillside during a night patrol at Jebal on 5 May 1967, killing the two crew and the two passengers. The third aircraft, ''XT641'', was destroyed on the ground in an incident where the pilot<ref>The Times, 7 September 1967, p.4</ref> and his F.O. intelligence officer passenger were captured and shot dead by the NLF after landing in a wadi bed whilst on a flight from Ataq to Mayfa\u2019ah on 3 September 1967. The NLF then set fire to and destroyed the aircraft. Dropping recovered aircraft from helicopters is not the preserve of the Royal Air Force. On 1 August 1968, Westland Sioux ''XT123'' crashed at Sharjah, Oman, and was subsequently written off when it was dropped by the Westland Scout that was attempting the recovery.\n\nLt David John Ralls, [[Royal Corps of Transport]], was awarded the DFC<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44508 |supp=y |date=19 January 1968 |page=875 }}</ref> for counter-attacking a large group of enemy which had previously attacked an army road repair party on the road to Habilayn. Lt Ralls attack, on 30 May 1967, utilised both the forward-firing and pintle-mounted weapons, forcing the enemy to retreat. Despite his aircraft being hit a number of times, he then directed three [[Hawker Hunter]] airstrikes onto the target.\n\n===Falklands War===\nAt the start of Operation Corporate, six Scouts from 3 CBAS were operating alongside three machines from [[No. 656 Squadron AAC]]. When [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)#Falklands War|5 Infantry Brigade]] landed, they were joined by another three Scouts from 656 Squadron. During the Falklands conflict, the Scout was engaged in CASEVAC, re-supply and special forces insertion roles. One aircraft, ''XT629'', was one of two Scouts of B Flight, 3 CBAS that was attacked by two [[FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1]]s (the only Argentine [[Air-to-air combat|air-to-air]] victory in the war) of Grupo 3 near Camilla Creek House, North of Goose Green. ''XT629'' was hit by cannon fire and crashed, killing the pilot and severing the leg of the crewman, who was thrown clear of the wreckage on impact. The second Scout evaded the Pucar\u00e1s and later returned to the site to CASEVAC the survivor. Another Scout, ''XR628'', of 656 Sqn AAC, suffered a main rotor gearbox failure whilst in a low hover over MacPhee Pond on 8 June 1982. ''XR628'' had taken cover as two pairs of A-4 Skyhawks from Grupo 5 approached; these aircraft later attacked the RFA LSLs ''Sir Galahad'' and ''Sir Tristram'' at Bluff Cove. Once the threat had passed and the pilot began to climb away, the main gearbox failed at the main input drive and the aircraft made a forced landing at the lakeside in around four feet of water. The two crew were picked up another 656 Sqn Scout piloted by Capt J G Greenhalgh later that day. The aircraft was eventually recovered and airlifted to Fitzroy by Sea King on 11 June, but was subsequently written off on its return to the UK. Following research at the National Archive, Kew, it has been determined that ''XR628'' was also the aircraft that was shot down on 26 May 1964, carrying 3 Para's CO, Lt Col Farrar-Hockley.\n\nScouts armed with SS.11 anti-tank missiles were used to great effect during the Falklands campaign. On 14 June 1982, an Argentine 105&nbsp;mm Pack Howitzer battery dug in to the West of Stanley Racecourse was firing at the Scots Guards as they approached Mount Tumbledown. As the guns were out of range of the [[MILAN]] ATGWs of nearby [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|2 Para]], their 2IC, Major Chris Keeble, contacted Capt J G Greenhalgh of 656 Sqn AAC on the radio and requested a HELARM using SS.11 missiles to attack them. As he was engaged in ammunition re-supply, his Scout was not fitted with missile booms \u2013 this was in order to reduce weight and increase the aircraft lift capability. Capt Greenhalgh then returned to Estancia House, where his aircraft was refuelled, fitted out, and armed with four missiles in 20 minutes with the rotors still turning. An 'O' group was then held with the crews of two Scouts of 3 CBAS and Capt Greenhalgh took off on a reconnaissance mission, while the other aircraft were fitted out and readied. Within 20 minutes, he had located the target and carried out a detailed recce of the area. He fired two missiles at the enemy positions and then returned to a pre-arranged RV to meet up and guide in the other two Scouts. The three aircraft, positioned 100 metres apart, then fired a total of 10 missiles (nine missiles hit, one failed) from the ridge overlooking the Argentine positions 3,000m away and succeeded in hitting the howitzers, nearby bunkers, an ammunition dump and the command post. The Argentine troops returned mortar fire, a round landing directly in front of Capt Greenhalgh's Scout.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nIn Northern Ireland, the Scout pioneered the use of the Heli-Tele<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%202623.html? Scout fitted with Heli-tele]</ref> aerial surveillance system, having a gyro-stabilised Marconi unit shoe-horned into the rear cabin. The Heli-Tele unit weighed some {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}, although later developments reduced this significantly. The aircraft was also used for mounting Eagle patrols.  In this role, the rear cabin doors and seats were removed and four troops sat in the rear cabin with their feet resting on the skids. Operating with two aircraft in unison, this allowed an eight-man patrol to be quickly inserted into an area and mount snap vehicle check points (VCPs) if necessary. Up until 1973, the standard tail rotor colour scheme for the Scout was bands of red and white. On 14 September 1973, a soldier died during training at Gosford Castle, Armagh, after coming into contact with the tail rotor blades whilst the aircraft was on the ground. Following this accident, the tail rotor blade colour scheme was changed to the distinctive black and white bands.\n\nBecause of the specialist nature of operations in Northern Ireland, a particularly important piece of role equipment was introduced in the form of the 'Nightsun' 3.5 million candle power searchlight. Operations at night were greatly enhanced with the introduction of night vision goggles ([[Night Vision Device|NVGs]]), although these missions could still be hazardous. This was evident on the night of 2 December 1978, when the pilot of XW614, 659 Sqn, became disorientated during a sortie and crashed into Lough Ross, killing the two crew.<ref>[http://www.palacebarracksmemorialgarden.org/Army%20Air%20Corps.htm Capt Stirling & Cpl Adcock memorial]</ref> XW614 was the last of five Scouts written off during operations in the province.\n\n===Exports===\nUnlike its naval counterpart, the Scout did not achieve the same export success as the Wasp, with the Royal Jordanian Air Force acquiring three helicopters, two were operated in Uganda, and Bahrain had two helicopters, which were operated by the Bahrain Public Security Force in police service roles. The Scout never received civilian airworthiness certification, which prevented it from being sold to civilian operators, and meant that the design was used exclusively by the army from the outset. All current operators require an 'Experimental' certificate to fly them.\n\nTwo Scout helicopters were acquired by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in April 1963 and were operated by 723 Naval Air Squadron, with the aircraft being rotated aboard the hydrographic survey ship [[HMAS Moresby (1963)|HMAS ''Moresby'']]. The RAN Scouts proved the practicalities of operating helicopters from small ships for the RAN, and the RAN operated these helicopters up until 1973, when they were replaced by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|Bell 206B-1 Kiowas]]. The RAN experience with the Scouts aboard HMAS ''Moresby'' illustrated the need for a higher-level maintenance regime as a result of operating the helicopters in areas with high concentrations of abrasive coral sand encountered around the Australian coastline and the detrimental effect that it had on the rotor blades, airframe and engine components. Despite the additional effort to maintain the helicopters, the Scouts were considered to be superior to the seaplanes and flying boats that had previously been used in this role. One of the Scouts ditched in Wewak Harbour while taking off from HMAS ''Moresby'' in April 1967; it was subsequently recovered but the aircraft was deemed to be written off.\n\n===Survivors===\n[[File:Westland Scout - RIAT 2015 (24645449950).jpg|thumb|250px|Survivor Westland Scout flying in the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] 2015]]\nAlthough none are operational in military roles, there are still Scouts in the air; mainly in the UK; as of 2014 there were 10 Scouts remaining on the UK civil register, including the [[Army Air Corps Historic Flight]]'s aircraft. \n\nOutside the UK, the last of six Scouts that were exported to New Zealand have been withdrawn from use, leaving only ZS-HAS flying in South Africa operating.\n\n==Accidents and Incidents==\n\n*XR638 3 January 1966: While serving with 21 Flt, UK, the aircraft<ref>The Marlborough Times, 7 January 1966, p.1</ref> encountered engine problems caused by the inadvertent closure of the fuel cock in mistake for the heater control, during a delivery flight from Wroughton to Middle Wallop.

Developed from the [[Saro P.531]], it served as a land-based general purpose military helicopter, sharing a common ancestor and numerous components with the naval-orientated [[Westland Wasp]] helicopter. The type's primary operator was the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] of the [[British Army]], which operated it in several conflict zones including [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Falklands War]].\n\n==Development==\nBoth the Scout and the Wasp were developed from the [[Saro P.531|Saunders-Roe P.531]], itself a development of the [[Saunders-Roe Skeeter]]. With the acquisition of Saunders Roe, Westland took over the P.531 project, which became the prototype for the Scout (originally called Sprite) and the Wasp. The initial [[Ministry of Defence (1947\u201364)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) development contract was for a five to six seat general purpose helicopter.{{sfn|Flight International|1960|p=349}}\n\nThe first version that met both RN and Army requirement, the P.531-2, flew on 9 August 1959 with a [[Bristol Siddeley Nimbus]] engine. A [[de Havilland Gnome]] engine-equipped version was also trialled, starting 3 May 1960. The production Scout AH.1 used a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] Nimbus engine (RR having acquired Bristol Siddeley by then). The engine was rated at {{convert|1050|shp|abbr=on}}, but the torque was limited to {{convert|685|shp|abbr=on}}. Extensive theoretical design and practical testing was carried out to provide an undercarriage that was tolerant to [[ground resonance]]. The first Army Scout AH Mk 1 flew on 4 August 1960, a powered-controls version followed in March 1961 and deliveries started in early 1963. Following trials ranging from Canada to Nairobi, the airframe was released for operations between \u221226C and [[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]+30C.{{sfn|Flight International|1963|p=232}}{{sfn|Stevens|1964|pp=183\u2013186,189}}\n\n==Design==\nBehind the two front seats was a three-seat bench, although this could be replaced with a four-seat bench when fitted with modified rear doors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was used for general light work, including observation, liaison, training and search & rescue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} When fitted as a light attack helicopter, it carried either two, skid-mounted, forward-firing machine gun ([[FN MAG|L8A1 General Purpose Machine Gun]]) packs or a single pintle-mounted machine gun in the rear cabin.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|p=33}} The pintle mount was available in both port and starboard mountings.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|pp=34\u201335}} The gun-packs, which were both aimed at a pre-set convergence angle, carried 200 rounds of ammunition and were mounted on a tubular spar that was fixed between the front and rear undercarriage legs.{{sfn|Rodwell|1972|pp=33\u201335}} In the anti-tank role, it could carry four guided missiles (the [[Nord SS.11]]).{{sfn|Ferguson|1982}} The sighting unit was the AF.120, the result of a joint venture between [[Avimo]] and Ferranti, had x2.5 and x10 magnification.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Flight International |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200191.html |last=Bentley|first=John |date=4 February 1971 |title=Through a glass, steadily |pages=176\u2013177 }}</ref> The APX Bezu sight unit was also evaluated but rejected, although it was adopted for use on the Westland Wasp.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} \n[[File:Scout with SS.11s-3.jpg|thumbnail|right|SS.11 equipped Scout of 3 CBAS in 1978]]\nAdditional testing and trials were carried out with the [[Swingfire]] anti-tank guided missile.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%203111.html |magazine=Flight International |date=23 November 1972 |title=photo caption |page=734 }}</ref> Initial firings were carried out in early 1972, to test the \"Hawkswing\" system for the [[Westland Lynx]], the associated AF.530 gyro-stabilized sight<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%200421.html|title=Defence: Hawkswing sight delivered |magazine=Flight International |date=21 March 1974 |page=363}}</ref> was subsequently trialled in 1974.

In the casualty evacuation role (CASEVAC), the Scout could carry two stretchers internally or two on externally mounted pods, the co-pilot's seat could also be reversed to allow an attendant to face the casualties.\n\nAlthough the general design of the aircraft was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the cabin heater switch being mounted next to the fuel cock; this led to the loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the fuel cock instead of switching off the cabin heater, causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.flyingmarines.com/Biographies/1961-1970/Streeter.htm |title=Alan Streeter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028120603/http://www.flyingmarines.com/Biographies/1961-1970/Streeter.htm |archivedate=28 October 2010 |website= flyingmarines.com}}</ref> In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. A wide variety of weapons and equipment were evaluated, although many were never adopted. Amongst these were the 7.62mm General Electric [[Minigun]] and the two-inch rocket pod.<ref>{{citation |magazine=Flight International |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200196.html |title=Army aviation gets teeth|date=1 February 1968 |page=171 }}</ref>{{sfn|Rodwell|1968|pp=190\u2013191}} The rocket pods were mounted either side of the central fuselage section on the multi-spar weapon booms and both smooth tube and fin-stabilised rockets were tested, although the accuracy was described as \"indifferent\". Studies were also carried out for a pintle-mounted [[M2 Browning machine gun]] in place of the standard 7.62 GPMG, and the French AME.621 20mm cannon.{{sfn|Rodwell|1968|p=190}} Another was the installation of a Bendix R.100 lightweight weather and ground-mapping [[radar]], which had a range of eight and 40 miles.{{clarify|date=July 2015|Which is it?

Engine problems delayed the introduction of the Scout until 1963, and as an interim measure the Army Air Corps received a small number of [[Alouette II]] helicopters. Although the aircraft's entry into service was delayed, the Scout still had a number of teething troubles when it was introduced. One of the earliest losses was XR596, which crashed into the jungle near Kluang airfield in southern Malaya on 16 July 1964, following a fuel pump failure. The two crew died in the incident. Engine failures were responsible for the loss of at least 11 military and civilian registered aircraft. The engine life of the Nimbus during the early part of its service was notoriously low, with four to six flying hours being the norm. A competition was allegedly held, with a prize to the first unit that could achieve an engine life of 25 flying hours. Operational experience and development work steadily improved the reliability of the Nimbus and by 1964 engine life had improved to two or three engine changes per 1,000 flying hours.\n\nThe Scout AH Mk 1 was operated by the Army Air Corps on general light work, including observation and liaison. Like the Wasp, the Scout could be fitted out with different role equipment including flotation gear and a Lucas air-driven hoist which had a lift capacity of {{convert|600|lb|abbr=on}}. In the light attack role, it was capable of carrying one pintle machine gun in the rear cabin (it is possible to carry two pintle-mounted GPMGs in the cabin, although this would, unsurprisingly, be somewhat cramped) or two forward-firing 7.62mm L7 General Purpose Machine Guns ([[GPMG]]s) fixed to the undercarriage skid. These GPMG combinations were sometimes used in unison to great effect.\n\nThe forward firing GPMGs were electrically operated, being fired by the pilot and aimed using a rudimentary system of drawing a small cross on the windscreen with a chinagraph pencil. In sandy conditions, these weapons could jam, which necessitated one of the free crew leaning out of the cockpit door and 'booting' the offending weapon in the hope of clearing it. This procedure was not strictly in accordance with the flight reference cards. The [[L7A1]] pintle-mounted weapon was operated by a door gunner.\n[[File:Westland Scout XR628 Habilayn.jpg|thumb|right|8 Flight Scout AH.1 at Habilayn, Radfan 1967]]\nIn the anti-tank role, four [[SS.11]] ATGWs were carried; these could be carried in conjunction with the pintle-mounted GPMG. During the Falklands campaign, the SS.11 achieved some success, being used to attack Argentine positions on 14 June 1982. For night time reconnaissance, the Scout could carry four {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on}} parachute flares mounted on special carriers. In addition, two smaller parachute flares could be carried to allow emergency landings at night. These were fitted on the starboard rear fuselage on a special attachment point. About 150 Scout helicopters were acquired for the Army Air Corps, which operated them until 1994.\n\nThe way British military aviation has been established has meant that the [[Royal Marines]] have never actually \"owned\" their own aircraft. The larger [[Westland Whirlwind (helicopter)|Whirlwind]], [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] and [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] <nowiki/>have been [[Fleet Air Arm|Royal Navy]] helicopters and, like today's [[Westland Lynx#Land-based variants|Lynx AH Mk 7]], the Scout AH Mk 1s operated by [[3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron]] (3 CBAS) were British Army helicopters on loan. 3 CBAS flew the Scout from 1971 through to 1982, when it was replaced by the Westland Lynx, and the squadron was eventually renumbered as [[847 Naval Air Squadron]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/fleet-air-arm/helicopter-squadrons/wildcat/847-naval-air-squadron/847-affiliations 847 NAS Affiliations]</ref>\n\nThe Scout saw operational service in [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Borneo]], [[Aden Emergency|Aden]], Oman, Rhodesia, Northern Ireland and then in the South Atlantic.\n\nThe Territorial Army (AAC) formed 666 Squadron with a number of Scouts in the late 1980s.\n\n===Borneo===\nMystery still surrounds a Scout that went missing 20 September 1965.<ref>[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650923.2.4.aspx Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: XR599 \u2013 Was missing helicopter hijacked?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320231259/http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650923.2.4.aspx |date=20 March 2012 }}</ref>\n''XR599'' set off for a {{convert|40|nmi|km|adj=on}} night flight from Lundu to Kuching, the mission being to transport a local communist suspect to the Sarawak capital for interrogation. At 23:00 hrs, the aircraft was posted as missing and a search and rescue mission was mounted. Although the aircraft and the remains of the pilot, the escort rifleman and the suspect were never found, a fisherman later dredged up small parts of the aircraft wreckage. On 23 September, a local newspaper, ''The Strait Times'', printed a story speculating that the Scout had been hi-jacked by the prisoner who had somehow managed to capture his escort's weapon and then ordered the pilot to either fly out to sea or over the jungle towards the Indonesian border until they ran out of fuel. Tragedy struck a second time on 25 September when an RAF Westland Whirlwind HAR.10 of 225 Sqn, searching over jungle for ''XR599'', crashed killing the five crew.<ref>[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19650927.2.2&sessionid=417242aa9fbc4d7fa439c4975c8a9d23 Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: 5 Die in Copter Crash in Sarawak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403153933/http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19650927.2.2&sessionid=417242aa9fbc4d7fa439c4975c8a9d23 |date=3 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Aden and Radfan===\nIn Aden and Radfan, a number of Scouts were shot down, although these usually resulted in a forced landing and the aircraft were recovered, repaired and returned to service. An example of this occurred on 26 May 1964 when the CO of [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|3 Para]], Lt Col [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43641 |supp=y |page=4347 |date=30 April 1965 }}</ref> used a Scout to reconnoitre the Wadi Dhubsan area, Radfan. The aircraft was hit by enemy fire<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43641 |supp=y |page=4348| date=30 April 1965 }}</ref> and the pilot made an emergency landing behind enemy lines. The aircraft was subsequently recovered; Farrar-Hockley rejoined the unit and was awarded the Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for his leadership. Three Scouts were written off during the campaign, the first, ''XR634'', was through pilot error whilst landing on 16 May 1966. Although initially repairable, this aircraft was subsequently damaged beyond economic repair when it was dropped by the RAF Westland Wessex sent to recover it. The second aircraft, ''XT635'', flew into a hillside during a night patrol at Jebal on 5 May 1967, killing the two crew and the two passengers. The third aircraft, ''XT641'', was destroyed on the ground in an incident where the pilot<ref>The Times, 7 September 1967, p.4</ref> and his F.O. intelligence officer passenger were captured and shot dead by the NLF after landing in a wadi bed whilst on a flight from Ataq to Mayfa\u2019ah on 3 September 1967. The NLF then set fire to and destroyed the aircraft. Dropping recovered aircraft from helicopters is not the preserve of the Royal Air Force. On 1 August 1968, Westland Sioux ''XT123'' crashed at Sharjah, Oman, and was subsequently written off when it was dropped by the Westland Scout that was attempting the recovery.\n\nLt David John Ralls, [[Royal Corps of Transport]], was awarded the DFC<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44508 |supp=y |date=19 January 1968 |page=875 }}</ref> for counter-attacking a large group of enemy which had previously attacked an army road repair party on the road to Habilayn. Lt Ralls attack, on 30 May 1967, utilised both the forward-firing and pintle-mounted weapons, forcing the enemy to retreat. Despite his aircraft being hit a number of times, he then directed three [[Hawker Hunter]] airstrikes onto the target.\n\n===Falklands War===\nAt the start of Operation Corporate, six Scouts from 3 CBAS were operating alongside three machines from [[No. 656 Squadron AAC]]. When [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)#Falklands War|5 Infantry Brigade]] landed, they were joined by another three Scouts from 656 Squadron. During the Falklands conflict, the Scout was engaged in CASEVAC, re-supply and special forces insertion roles. One aircraft, ''XT629'', was one of two Scouts of B Flight, 3 CBAS that was attacked by two [[FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1]]s (the only Argentine [[Air-to-air combat|air-to-air]] victory in the war) of Grupo 3 near Camilla Creek House, North of Goose Green. ''XT629'' was hit by cannon fire and crashed, killing the pilot and severing the leg of the crewman, who was thrown clear of the wreckage on impact. The second Scout evaded the Pucar\u00e1s and later returned to the site to CASEVAC the survivor. Another Scout, ''XR628'', of 656 Sqn AAC, suffered a main rotor gearbox failure whilst in a low hover over MacPhee Pond on 8 June 1982. ''XR628'' had taken cover as two pairs of A-4 Skyhawks from Grupo 5 approached; these aircraft later attacked the RFA LSLs ''Sir Galahad'' and ''Sir Tristram'' at Bluff Cove. Once the threat had passed and the pilot began to climb away, the main gearbox failed at the main input drive and the aircraft made a forced landing at the lakeside in around four feet of water. The two crew were picked up another 656 Sqn Scout piloted by Capt J G Greenhalgh later that day. The aircraft was eventually recovered and airlifted to Fitzroy by Sea King on 11 June, but was subsequently written off on its return to the UK. Following research at the National Archive, Kew, it has been determined that ''XR628'' was also the aircraft that was shot down on 26 May 1964, carrying 3 Para's CO, Lt Col Farrar-Hockley.\n\nScouts armed with SS.11 anti-tank missiles were used to great effect during the Falklands campaign. On 14 June 1982, an Argentine 105&nbsp;mm Pack Howitzer battery dug in to the West of Stanley Racecourse was firing at the Scots Guards as they approached Mount Tumbledown. As the guns were out of range of the [[MILAN|Milan]] ATGWs of nearby [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|2 Para]], their 2IC, Major Chris Keeble, contacted Capt J G Greenhalgh of 656 Sqn AAC on the radio and requested a HELARM using SS.11 missiles to attack them. As he was engaged in ammunition re-supply, his Scout was not fitted with missile booms \u2013 this was in order to reduce weight and increase the aircraft lift capability. Capt Greenhalgh then returned to Estancia House, where his aircraft was refuelled, fitted out, and armed with four missiles in 20 minutes with the rotors still turning. An 'O' group was then held with the crews of two Scouts of 3 CBAS and Capt Greenhalgh took off on a reconnaissance mission, while the other aircraft were fitted out and readied. Within 20 minutes, he had located the target and carried out a detailed recce of the area. He fired two missiles at the enemy positions and then returned to a pre-arranged RV to meet up and guide in the other two Scouts. The three aircraft, positioned 100 metres apart, then fired a total of 10 missiles (nine missiles hit, one failed) from the ridge overlooking the Argentine positions 3,000m away and succeeded in hitting the howitzers, nearby bunkers, an ammunition dump and the command post. The Argentine troops returned mortar fire, a round landing directly in front of Capt Greenhalgh's Scout.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nIn Northern Ireland, the Scout pioneered the use of the Heli-Tele<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%202623.html? Scout fitted with Heli-tele]</ref> aerial surveillance system, having a gyro-stabilised Marconi unit shoe-horned into the rear cabin. The Heli-Tele unit weighed some {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}, although later developments reduced this significantly. The aircraft was also used for mounting Eagle patrols.  In this role, the rear cabin doors and seats were removed and four troops sat in the rear cabin with their feet resting on the skids. Operating with two aircraft in unison, this allowed an eight-man patrol to be quickly inserted into an area and mount snap vehicle check points (VCPs) if necessary. Up until 1973, the standard tail rotor colour scheme for the Scout was bands of red and white. On 14 September 1973, a soldier died during training at Gosford Castle, Armagh, after coming into contact with the tail rotor blades whilst the aircraft was on the ground. Following this accident, the tail rotor blade colour scheme was changed to the distinctive black and white bands.\n\nBecause of the specialist nature of operations in Northern Ireland, a particularly important piece of role equipment was introduced in the form of the 'Nightsun' 3.5 million candle power searchlight. Operations at night were greatly enhanced with the introduction of night vision goggles ([[Night Vision Device|NVGs]]), although these missions could still be hazardous. This was evident on the night of 2 December 1978, when the pilot of XW614, 659 Sqn, became disorientated during a sortie and crashed into Lough Ross, killing the two crew.<ref>[http://www.palacebarracksmemorialgarden.org/Army%20Air%20Corps.htm Capt Stirling & Cpl Adcock memorial]</ref> XW614 was the last of five Scouts written off during operations in the province.\n\n===Exports===\nUnlike its naval counterpart, the Scout did not achieve the same export success as the Wasp, with the Royal Jordanian Air Force acquiring three helicopters, two were operated in Uganda, and Bahrain had two helicopters, which were operated by the Bahrain Public Security Force in police service roles. The Scout never received civilian airworthiness certification, which prevented it from being sold to civilian operators, and meant that the design was used exclusively by the army from the outset. All current operators require an 'Experimental' certificate to fly them.\n\nTwo Scout helicopters were acquired by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in April 1963 and were operated by 723 Naval Air Squadron, with the aircraft being rotated aboard the hydrographic survey ship [[HMAS Moresby (1963)|HMAS ''Moresby'']]. The RAN Scouts proved the practicalities of operating helicopters from small ships for the RAN, and the RAN operated these helicopters up until 1973, when they were replaced by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|Bell 206B-1 Kiowas]]. The RAN experience with the Scouts aboard HMAS ''Moresby'' illustrated the need for a higher-level maintenance regime as a result of operating the helicopters in areas with high concentrations of abrasive coral sand encountered around the Australian coastline and the detrimental effect that it had on the rotor blades, airframe and engine components. Despite the additional effort to maintain the helicopters, the Scouts were considered to be superior to the seaplanes and flying boats that had previously been used in this role. One of the Scouts ditched in Wewak Harbour while taking off from HMAS ''Moresby'' in April 1967; it was subsequently recovered but the aircraft was deemed to be written off.\n\n===Survivors===\n[[File:Westland Scout - RIAT 2015 (24645449950).jpg|thumb|250px|Survivor Westland Scout flying in the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] 2015]]\nAlthough none are operational in military roles, there are still Scouts in the air; mainly in the UK; as of 2014 there were 10 Scouts remaining on the UK civil register, including the [[Army Air Corps Historic Flight]]'s aircraft. \n\nOutside the UK, the last of six Scouts that were exported to New Zealand have been withdrawn from use, leaving only ZS-HAS flying in South Africa operating.\n\n==Accidents and Incidents==\n\n*XR638 3 January 1966: While serving with 21 Flt, UK, the aircraft<ref>The Marlborough Times, 7 January 1966, p.1</ref> encountered engine problems caused by the inadvertent closure of the fuel cock in mistake for the heater control, during a delivery flight from Wroughton to Middle Wallop.

The preliminary conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the [[xenographic]] barrier from palm civet to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in [[raccoon dog]]s (''Nyctereuteus'' sp.), [[ferret badger]]s (''Melogale'' spp.), and domestic cats. In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese [[bat]]s.<ref name=\"Li\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Li |author-first1=W. |author-last2=Shi |author-first2=Z. |author-last3=Yu |author-first3=M. |display-authors=etal |title=Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=676\u2013679 |date=2005 |pmid=16195424 |doi=10.1126/science.1118391 |bibcode=2005Sci...310..676L}}</ref><ref name=\"Lau\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Lau |author-first1=S.

Crompton was the first in a line of men of paper. Thomas Bonsor could well be called the first papermaking tycoon and his mill at Farnworth became a showpiece for the craft, he died on 5 September 1858 and was buried in the churchyard of [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Farnworth]]. The first steam weaving mill was opened in 1828 by James Rothwell Barnes, later becoming a spinning mill. At Nob End a chemical works was founded and the whole area is riddled with old coal mine workings from shallow pits to deep shafts which have all now been capped. The mill at Farnworth passed to William James Rideout who continued the tradition of making paper until the great depression of 1883 when the mill closed and paper manufacture ceased.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mbbcanal.demon.co.uk/trail/bolton/rockhall/rockhall.html | title = Manchester Bury and Bolton Canal | accessdate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1894, the mill was reopened as a bleach works by J.

The first steam weaving mill was opened in 1828 by James Rothwell Barnes, later becoming a spinning mill. At Nob End a chemical works was founded and the whole area is riddled with old coal mine workings from shallow pits to deep shafts which have all now been capped. The mill at Farnworth passed to William James Rideout who continued the tradition of making paper until the great depression of 1883 when the mill closed and paper manufacture ceased.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mbbcanal.demon.co.uk/trail/bolton/rockhall/rockhall.html | title = Manchester Bury and Bolton Canal | accessdate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1894, the mill was reopened as a bleach works by J.

About 7 million years ago, the ancestors of ''Citrus'' split into the main genus, ''Citrus'', and the genus ''Poncirus'' (such as the [[trifoliate orange]]), which is closely enough related that it can still be hybridized with all other citrus and used as rootstock. These estimates are made using genetic mapping of plant [[chloroplast]]s.<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/05/molbev.msv082.full.pdf+html A phylogenetic analysis of 34 chloroplast genomes elucidates the relationships between wild and domestic species within the genus ''Citrus'']</ref> A DNA study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2018 concludes that the genus ''Citrus'' first evolved in the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s, in the area of [[Assam]] ([[India]]), western [[Yunnan]] ([[China]]), and northern [[Myanmar]].<ref>Briggs, Helen (8 Feb 2018), \"DNA Story of when life first gave us lemons,\" BBC, https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42960445, accessed 12 Feb 2018</ref>\n\nThe three ancestral (sometimes characterized as \"original\" or \"fundamental\") species in the genus ''Citrus'' associated with modern ''Citrus'' cultivars are the [[mandarin orange]], [[pomelo]], and [[citron]].

Some fruits, for example cherries, physically mature and then continue to ripen on the tree. Other fruits, such as pears, are picked when mature, but before they ripen, then continue to ripen off the tree. Citrus fruits pass from immaturity to maturity to overmaturity while still on the tree. Once they are separated from the tree, they do not increase in sweetness or continue to ripen. The only way change may happen after being picked is that they eventually start to decay.\n\nWith oranges, colour cannot be used as an indicator of ripeness because sometimes the rinds turn orange long before the oranges are ready to eat. Tasting them is the only way to know whether they are ready to eat.\n\n[[File:Mandariner Citrus deliciosa.jpg|thumb|right|Mediterranean Mandarin (''[[Citrus \u00d7deliciosa]]'' plantation, Son Carri\u00f3 ([[Mallorca]])]]\n\nCitrus trees are not generally [[frost]] hardy.

Tangerines, tangors and [[yuzu]] can be grown outside even in regions with more marked subfreezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related trifoliate orange (''C. trifoliata'') can survive below {{convert|\u221220|C}}; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked, but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see [[citrange]]s).\n[[File:Citrus leaf.JPG|thumb|Leaf of ''Citrus'' tree]]\n\nThe trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's [[Inner Coast Ranges]]. At any age, citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and subtropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed.  The [[Plant stem|stems]] of many varieties have large sharp [[Spine (botany)|thorns]]. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to 18 months to ripen.\n\n=== Production ===\n{{See also|Citrus production}}\n[[File:Hauptanbaugebiete-Zitrusfr\u00fcchte.svg|thumb|Major producer regions]]\n\nAccording to the [[UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], world production of all citrus fruits in 2016 was 124 million [[ton]]s, with about half of this production as oranges.<ref name=\"fao16\">{{cite web |title=Citrus fruit, fresh and processed: Statistical Bulletin |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i8092e.pdf |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=28 February 2020 |date=2016}}</ref>  According to the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), citrus production grew during the early [[21st century]] mainly by the increase in [[tillage|cultivation]] areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes and [[consumer]] [[preference]] for healthy foods.<ref name=fao16/> In 2019-20, world production of oranges was estimated to be 47.5 million tons, led by Brazil, Mexico, the European Union, and China as the largest producers.<ref name=\"usda20\">{{cite web |title=Citrus: World Markets and Trade |url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/citrus.pdf |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=28 February 2020 |date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== As ornamental plants ===\n[[File:Orangerie Kruidtuin Leuven.jpg|thumb|[[Orangery]] of the [[Botanical Garden]] in [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nCitrus trees grown in tubs and wintered under cover were a feature of [[History of gardens|Renaissance gardens]], once glass-making technology enabled sufficient expanses of clear glass to be produced. An [[orangery]] was a feature of royal and aristocratic residences through the 17th and 18th centuries. The ''Orangerie'' at the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]], 1617, inspired imitations that were not eclipsed until the development of the modern greenhouse in the 1840s. In the United States, the earliest surviving orangery is at the [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Tayloe House, Mount Airy, Virginia]]. George Washington had an orangery at [[Mount Vernon]].\n\nSome modern hobbyists still grow dwarf citrus in containers or greenhouses in areas where the weather is too cold to grow it outdoors. Consistent climate, sufficient sunlight, and proper watering are crucial if the trees are to thrive and produce fruit. Compared to many of the usual \"green shrubs\", citrus trees better tolerate poor container care. For cooler winter areas, limes and lemons should not be grown, since they are more sensitive to winter cold than other citrus fruits. Hybrids with kumquats (\u00d7 ''[[Citrofortunella]]'') have good cold resistance.

The shriveling leaves eventually fall, and if the plant loses too many, it will slowly die. This condition is often caused by an excessively high [[pH]] ([[alkaline soil]]), which prevents the plant from absorbing [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], or other nutrients it needs to produce [[chlorophyll]]. This condition can be cured by adding an appropriate acidic fertilizer formulated for citrus, which can sometimes revive a plant to produce new leaves and even flower buds within a few weeks under optimum conditions. A soil which is too acidic can also cause problems; citrus prefers neutral soil (pH between 6 and 8). Citrus plants are also sensitive to excessive [[salt]] in the soil. [[Soil testing]] may be necessary to properly diagnose nutrient-deficiency diseases.<ref name=Mauk>{{cite web|last=Mauk|first=Peggy A.|title=Questions and Answers to Citrus Management (3rd ed.)|url=http://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/391-272.pdf|publisher=University of California Cooperative Extension|accessdate=2014-05-24|author2=Tom Shea }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Culinary ===\nMany citrus fruits, such as oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, and [[clementine]]s, are generally eaten fresh.<ref name=janick/> They are typically peeled and can be easily split into segments.<ref name=janick/> Grapefruit is more commonly halved and eaten out of the skin with a spoon.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.aihd.ku.edu/foods/grapefruit.html|title = Foods Indigenous to the Western Hemisphere: Grapefruit|publisher = Aihd.ku.edu|access-date = |first = Scott|last = Sheu|website = American Indian Health and Diet Project|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100818035403/http://www.aihd.ku.edu/foods/grapefruit.html|archive-date = 2010-08-18|url-status = dead}}</ref>  Special spoons ([[grapefruit spoon]]s) with serrated tips are designed for this purpose. Orange and grapefruit juices are also  popular [[breakfast]] beverages. More acidic citrus, such as lemons and limes, are generally not eaten on their own. [[Meyer lemon]]s can be eaten out of hand with the fragrant skin; they are both sweet and sour. [[Lemonade]] or [[limeade]] are popular beverages prepared by diluting the juices of these fruits and adding sugar. Lemons and limes are also used as garnishes or in cooked dishes. Their juice is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes; it can commonly be found in salad dressings and squeezed over cooked fish, meat, or vegetables.\n\nA variety of flavours can be derived from different parts and treatments of citrus fruits.<ref name=janick/> The [[peel (fruit)|rind]] and [[essential oil|oil]] of the fruit is generally bitter, especially when cooked, so is often combined with sugar. The [[juice vesicles|fruit pulp]] can vary from sweet to extremely sour. [[Marmalade]], a condiment derived from cooked orange and lemon, can be especially bitter, but is usually sweetened to cut the bitterness and produce a jam-like result. Lemon or lime is commonly used as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]] for water, soft drinks, or cocktails. Citrus juices, rinds, or slices are used in a variety of mixed drinks. The colourful outer skin of some citrus fruits, known as [[zest (ingredient)|zest]], is used as a flavouring in cooking; the white inner portion of the peel, the pith, is usually avoided due to its bitterness. The zest of a citrus fruit, typically lemon or an orange, can also be soaked in water in a [[coffee filter]], and drunk.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:NIH citrus.jpg|Wedges of pink [[grapefruit]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and [[lemon]], and a half [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] (clockwise from top)\nFile:Calamansi (sliced) - Philippines.jpg|[[Calamansi]], an ubiquitous part of traditional [[Philippine condiments|dipping sauces and condiments]] in [[Philippine cuisine]]\nFile:Citrus aurantiifolia in Kadavoor.jpg|''[[Citrus aurantifolia]]'' in [[Kerala]]\nFile:Pomeranzen.jpg|Ripe [[bitter orange]]s (''Citrus \u00d7 aurantium'') from [[Asprovalta]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Phytochemicals and research===\nSome ''Citrus'' species contain significant amounts of the [[phytochemical]] class called [[furanocoumarin]]s, a diverse family of naturally occurring organic chemical compounds.<ref name=\"Chen\">{{cite journal | last=Chen | first=Meng | last2=Zhou | first2=Shu-yi | last3=Fabriaga | first3=Erlinda | last4=Zhang | first4=Pian-hong | last5=Zhou | first5=Quan | title=Food-drug interactions precipitated by fruit juices other than grapefruit juice: An update review | journal=Journal of Food and Drug Analysis | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=2018 | issn=1021-9498 | pmid=29703387 | doi=10.1016/j.jfda.2018.01.009 | pages=S61\u2013S71|url=https://www.jfda-online.com/article/S1021-9498(18)30037-1/fulltext}}</ref><ref name=\"hung\">{{cite journal | last=Hung | first=Wei-Lun | last2=Suh | first2=Joon Hyuk | last3=Wang | first3=Yu | title=Chemistry and health effects of furanocoumarins in grapefruit | journal=Journal of Food and Drug Analysis| volume=25 | issue=1 | year=2017 | issn=1021-9498 | doi=10.1016/j.jfda.2016.11.008 | pages=71\u201383|pmid=28911545|url=https://www.jfda-online.com/article/S1021-9498(16)30184-3/fulltext}}</ref> In humans, some (not all) of these chemical compounds act as strong [[photosensitizer]]s when applied topically to the skin, while other furanocoumarins interact with medications when taken orally.

Plants in the genus produce '''citrus fruits''', including important [[crop]]s such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, [[grapefruit]]s, [[pomelo]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|limes]].\n\nThe genus ''Citrus'' is native to [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Melanesia]], and [[Australia]]. Various citrus species have been utilized and domesticated by indigenous cultures in these areas since ancient times. From there its cultivation spread into [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]] by the [[Austronesian expansion]] (c. 3000\u20131500 BCE); and to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Mediterranean]] (c. 1200 BCE) via the [[incense trade route]], and onwards to [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Wu\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu GA, Terol J, Ibanez V, L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda A, P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n E, Borred\u00e1 C, Domingo C, Tadeo FR, Carbonell-Caballero J, Alonso R, Curk F, Du D, Ollitrault P, Roose ML, Dopazo J, Gmitter FG, Rokhsar DS, Talon M |title=Genomics of the origin and evolution of Citrus |journal=Nature |volume=554 |issue=7692 |pages=311\u2013316 |date=February 2018 |pmid=29414943 |doi=10.1038/nature25447 |url=|bibcode=2018Natur.554..311W }}</ref><ref name=\"fuller\"/><ref name=\"Zech-Matterne\"/><ref name=\"langgut\"/>\n\n== History ==\nCitrus plants are native to subtropical and tropical regions of Asia, [[Island Southeast Asia]], [[Near Oceania]], and northeastern [[Australia]].

Citrus species began to diverge from a common ancestor about 15 million years ago, at about the same time that ''[[Severinia (plant)|Severinia]]'' (such as the [[Chinese box orange]]) diverged from the same ancestor. About 7 million years ago, the ancestors of ''Citrus'' split into the main genus, ''Citrus'', and the genus ''Poncirus'' (such as the [[trifoliate orange]]), which is closely enough related that it can still be hybridized with all other citrus and used as rootstock. These estimates are made using genetic mapping of plant [[chloroplast]]s.<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/05/molbev.msv082.full.pdf+html A phylogenetic analysis of 34 chloroplast genomes elucidates the relationships between wild and domestic species within the genus ''Citrus'']</ref> A DNA study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2018 concludes that the genus ''Citrus'' first evolved in the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s, in the area of [[Assam]] ([[India]]), western [[Yunnan]] ([[China]]), and northern [[Myanmar]].<ref>Briggs, Helen (8 Feb 2018), \"DNA Story of when life first gave us lemons,\" BBC, https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42960445, accessed 12 Feb 2018</ref>\n\nThe three ancestral (sometimes characterized as \"original\" or \"fundamental\") species in the genus ''Citrus'' associated with modern ''Citrus'' cultivars are the [[mandarin orange]], [[pomelo]], and [[citron]].

Some fruits, for example cherries, physically mature and then continue to ripen on the tree. Other fruits, such as pears, are picked when mature, but before they ripen, then continue to ripen off the tree. Citrus fruits pass from immaturity to maturity to overmaturity while still on the tree. Once they are separated from the tree, they do not increase in sweetness or continue to ripen. The only way change may happen after being picked is that they eventually start to decay.\n\nWith oranges, colour cannot be used as an indicator of ripeness because sometimes the rinds turn orange long before the oranges are ready to eat. Tasting them is the only way to know whether they are ready to eat.\n\n[[File:Mandariner Citrus deliciosa.jpg|thumb|right|Mediterranean Mandarin (''[[Citrus \u00d7deliciosa]]'' plantation, Son Carri\u00f3 ([[Mallorca]])]]\n\nCitrus trees are not generally [[frost]] hardy.

Tangerines, tangors and [[yuzu]] can be grown outside even in regions with more marked subfreezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related trifoliate orange (''C. trifoliata'') can survive below {{convert|\u221220|C}}; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked, but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see [[citrange]]s).\n[[File:Citrus leaf.JPG|thumb|Leaf of ''Citrus'' tree]]\n\nThe trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's [[Inner Coast Ranges]]. At any age, citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and subtropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed.  The [[Plant stem|stems]] of many varieties have large sharp [[Spine (botany)|thorns]]. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to 18 months to ripen.\n\n=== Production ===\n{{See also|Citrus production}}\n[[File:Hauptanbaugebiete-Zitrusfr\u00fcchte.svg|thumb|Major producer regions]]\n\nAccording to the [[UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], world production of all citrus fruits in 2016 was 124 million [[ton]]s, with about half of this production as oranges.<ref name=\"fao16\">{{cite web |title=Citrus fruit, fresh and processed: Statistical Bulletin |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i8092e.pdf |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=28 February 2020 |date=2016}}</ref>  According to the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), citrus production grew during the early [[21st century]] mainly by the increase in [[tillage|cultivation]] areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes and [[consumer]] [[preference]] for healthy foods.<ref name=fao16/> In 2019-20, world production of oranges was estimated to be 47.5 million tons, led by Brazil, Mexico, the European Union, and China as the largest producers.<ref name=\"usda20\">{{cite web |title=Citrus: World Markets and Trade |url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/citrus.pdf |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=28 February 2020 |date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== As ornamental plants ===\n[[File:Orangerie Kruidtuin Leuven.jpg|thumb|[[Orangery]] of the [[Botanical Garden]] in [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nCitrus trees grown in tubs and wintered under cover were a feature of [[History of gardens|Renaissance gardens]], once glass-making technology enabled sufficient expanses of clear glass to be produced. An [[orangery]] was a feature of royal and aristocratic residences through the 17th and 18th centuries. The ''Orangerie'' at the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]], 1617, inspired imitations that were not eclipsed until the development of the modern greenhouse in the 1840s. In the United States, the earliest surviving orangery is at the [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Tayloe House, Mount Airy, Virginia]]. George Washington had an orangery at [[Mount Vernon]].\n\nSome modern hobbyists still grow dwarf citrus in containers or greenhouses in areas where the weather is too cold to grow it outdoors. Consistent climate, sufficient sunlight, and proper watering are crucial if the trees are to thrive and produce fruit. Compared to many of the usual \"green shrubs\", citrus trees better tolerate poor container care. For cooler winter areas, limes and lemons should not be grown, since they are more sensitive to winter cold than other citrus fruits. Hybrids with kumquats (\u00d7 ''[[Citrofortunella]]'') have good cold resistance.

This condition can be cured by adding an appropriate acidic fertilizer formulated for citrus, which can sometimes revive a plant to produce new leaves and even flower buds within a few weeks under optimum conditions.
