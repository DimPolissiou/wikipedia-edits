Raised in [[Liberty City (Miami)|Liberty City]], [[Miami]], Brown attended [[Miami Norland High School]], where he competed in both football and track. He played [[college football]] at [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan University]], where he earned All-American honors in 2008 and 2009 as a punt returner. A sixth-round pick by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 2010, Brown has amassed more receptions than any other player since he entered the league.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24005878 |title=Antonio at 30: How Brown stacks up against Rice, what's next |last=Fowler |first=Jeremy |date=July 10, 2018 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring Brown's first season with the Steelers, the team advanced to [[Super Bowl XLV]] but lost to the [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. He finished his rookie season with 16 receptions for 167 yards in ten games. During his second NFL season, he became the first player in NFL history to have more than 1,000 yards receiving and returning in the same year. For his efforts, Brown was selected as a punt returner for the [[2012 Pro Bowl]]. In 2013, he became the only receiver in NFL history to record five receptions and at least 50 yards in every single game of an NFL season. Although his on-the-field productivity continued over the next several seasons, including leading the league in receptions and receiving yards in 2014, receptions in 2015, receiving yards in 2017, and receiving touchdowns in 2018, Brown's relationship with the Steelers soured, especially with quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]], and he eventually requested a trade.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/antonio-brown-goes-public-with-his-desire-to-leave-pittsburgh-time-to-move-on/ |title=Antonio Brown goes public with his desire to leave Pittsburgh: 'Time to move on' |last=Dubin |first=Jared |date=February 12, 2019 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Brown was traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]], who then made him the highest-paid receiver in the league. However, his time in Oakland was short-lived, and following several off-the-field incidents, including a confrontation with general manager [[Mike Mayock]], the team released Brown without him ever playing a regular-season game. Brown signed with the [[New England Patriots]] shortly thereafter but was cut after appearing in just one game. At the time, the NFL was investigating [[sexual assault]] allegations made against him.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown is the son of retired [[Arena Football League]] star [[Eddie Brown (arena football)|Eddie Brown]], who was named the best player in the league's history in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2297305 |title='Touchdown' Eddie Brown tops Arena top 20 list |date=January 19, 2006 |agency=Associated Press|website=ESPN |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref> He played wide receiver for the [[Albany Firebirds]] and collegiate football for [[Louisiana Tech]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/blog/pittsburgh-steelers/post/_/id/17599/touchdown-eddie-brown-amazed-at-son-antonios-brilliance-not-bitter-at-burfict |title='Touchdown' Eddie Brown amazed at son Antonio's brilliance |last=Fowler |first=Jeremy |date=January 25, 2016 |website=ESPN.com |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==High school career==\n\n===Miami Norland High School===\nBrown attended [[Miami Norland High School]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], where he was a two-sport athlete in both [[high school football|football]] and [[track & field]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/high-school/prep-miami-dade/article194365214.html |title=South Florida's deep connection to the NFL playoffs runs through high school football |last=McPherson |first=Jordan |date=January 12, 2018 |access-date=February 25, 2018 |language=en |website=Miami Herald}}</ref> In [[high school football|football]], Brown played [[running back]], [[quarterback]], [[wide receiver]], and [[punt returner]] for the Vikings.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://247sports.com/Bolt/Steelers-Antonio-Brown-posts-video-of-his-High-School-highlights-47676907 |title=Steelers Antonio Brown posts video of his High School highlights |last=Deardo |first=Bryan |date=September 22, 2016 |website=247Sports |access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> He was a two-time Class 6A all-state selection and was also named North Athlete of the Year at 2005 Miami-Dade Gridiron Classic.

[[Portland stone]], a [[limestone]] famous for its use in British and world architecture, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the [[United Nations Headquarters]], continues to be quarried here.\n\n[[Portland Harbour]], in between Portland and Weymouth, is one of the largest man-made harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a [[Royal Navy]] base, and played prominent roles during [[World War I|the First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]; ships of the Royal Navy and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].\n\nThe name Portland is used for one of the [[British Sea Areas]], and has been [[Portland (disambiguation)|exported]] as the name of North American and Australian towns.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Uk dor portcastle.JPG|thumb|left|325px|[[Portland Castle]] was built to defend Portland in the 16th century.]]\n\nPortland has been inhabited since at least the [[Mesolithic]] period (the Middle [[Stone Age]])\u2014there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the [[Culverwell Mesolithic Site]], near [[Portland Bill]],<ref name=\"Mesolithic\">{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm | title = Mesolithic Site, Portland | publisher = Association for Portland Archaeology | accessdate = 30 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070609212653/http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 9 June 2007}}</ref> and of habitation since then.

Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer maternity leave packages to its employees.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Even in the absence of this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through [[collective bargaining]]. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.\n\nDespite some localized employees' access to maternity leave, there was growing pressure for national maternity leave legislation in the early 1990s. Many new mothers continued to be excluded from such maternity leave provisions despite growing national demand. Women now enjoyed greater employment opportunities and changing gender norms that encouraged increased labor involvement. This increased [[female employment]] extended to mothers as well who now were now more likely to engage in the workforce even if they had a young child.

In general, only employment within seven years is counted unless the break in service is (1) due to an employee's fulfillment of military obligations, or (2) governed by a collective bargaining agreement or other written agreement.\n\nThe FMLA is the only law that federally protects American employees who go on maternity or family leave their resumed job security.

For instance, the PDA upholds maternity leave by arguing that employees who give temporarily disabled folks a disability leave should give pregnant women maternity leave with the same protections and benefits. This PDA is essentially arguing that pregnant women should have rights to the same paid of unpaid leave that temporarily disabled workers are afforded by their employers. If an employer offers this protection to temporarily disabled workers then PDA says that pregnant women should also be protected using the same processes and same benefits. Additionally, in 2014 the PPACA amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act made it so that all insurance companies had to include maternity coverage in individual insurance plans. Therefore, filling the gap for unemployed women with individual insurance coverage plans to be able to afford the prenatal and postnatal pregnancy care that they need to have a healthy baby.

Nonetheless, many employees are still ineligible for the FMLA. According to the Family and Medical Leave Report in 2012, only 59% of American employees were eligible under the FMLA.<ref>{{cite web |title=Family and Medical Leave in 2012: Technical Report |url=https://www.dol.gov/asp/evaluation/fmla/fmla-2012-technical-report.pdf |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, employees who returned after FMLA, women exclusively, were given lower wages than the ones to when they left. This comes from the same study by researchers at the University of Maryland, as aforementioned. It should be said that these lower wages may have not been permanent since the study only went to highlight women's experience with maternity leave two years after they leave.\n \nIn recent polls from 2017, Democrats and Republicans both are in high support of federal funding for paid maternity and family leave. According to a study done by the Brookings Institution,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mathur |first=Aparna \n |display-authors=etal |title=Paid Family and Medical Leave: An Issue Whose Time Has Come |url=http://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/es_20170606_paidfamilyleave.pdf |website=Brookings |publisher=AEI-Brookings Working Group on Paid Family Leave |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> a non-profit think tank in D.C., 71% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support for a paid leave policy. Although the study did not reach a particular compromise on how the policies should work, who should pay for it, how much, and other concerns that might factor into creating a universal paid parental leave policy, they did reach a conclusion. Amongst the diverse group of researchers with different political and economic views, everyone believed that it is worthwhile to consider a federal paid leave policy. One important reason for this is because \u201cThe US is the only advanced country that provides no public support to new parents\u201d. \n \nThe U.S. does not presently have a federal paid maternity and family leave act. Some states, however, do include paid leave legislation for family members. States like California, New Jersey, and New York have pioneered paid leave legislature in their respective states. Reasons for paid leave might include higher job security for women and to reduce women's need for public assistance.

Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer maternity leave packages to its employees.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Even in the absence of this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through [[collective bargaining]]. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.\n\nDespite some localized employees' access to maternity leave, there was growing pressure for national maternity leave legislation in the early 1990s. Many new mothers continued to be excluded from such maternity leave provisions despite growing national demand. Women now enjoyed greater employment opportunities and changing gender norms that encouraged increased labor involvement. This increased [[female employment]] extended to mothers as well who now were now more likely to engage in the workforce even if they had a young child.

For instance, the PDA upholds maternity leave by arguing that employees who give temporarily disabled folks a disability leave should give pregnant women maternity leave with the same protections and benefits. This PDA is essentially arguing that pregnant women should have rights to the same paid of unpaid leave that temporarily disabled workers are afforded by their employers. If an employer offers this protection to temporarily disabled workers then PDA says that pregnant women should also be protected using the same processes and same benefits. Additionally, in 2014 the PPACA amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act made it so that all insurance companies had to include maternity coverage in individual insurance plans. Therefore, filling the gap for unemployed women with individual insurance coverage plans to be able to afford the prenatal and postnatal pregnancy care that they need to have a healthy baby.

This comes from the same study by researchers at the University of Maryland, as aforementioned. It should be said that these lower wages may have not been permanent since the study only went to highlight women's experience with maternity leave two years after they leave.\n \nIn recent polls from 2017, Democrats and Republicans both are in high support of federal funding for paid maternity and family leave.

Although the study did not reach a particular compromise on how the policies should work, who should pay for it, how much, and other concerns that might factor into creating a universal paid parental leave policy, they did reach a conclusion. Amongst the diverse group of researchers with different political and economic views, everyone believed that it is worthwhile to consider a federal paid leave policy. One important reason for this is because \u201cThe US is the only advanced country that provides no public support to new parents\u201d. \n \nThe U.S. does not presently have a federal paid maternity and family leave act. Some states, however, do include paid leave legislation for family members. States like California, New Jersey, and New York have pioneered paid leave legislature in their respective states.

Thus, the legislation imposes relatively few restrictions on American firms and instead underscores employer discretion in the shaping of maternity leave policy. These firms are thus free to offer maternity leave policies on terms that are more aligned with\u00a0[[corporatocracy|corporate interests]].<ref name=\"grs\" /> \u00a0This United States policy differs greatly from most other western countries in terms of maternity leave provision.

The [[Hungarian Communist Party]], now under the leadership of [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]], two survivors from the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of 1919, received support from only 17% of the population. The Soviet commander in Hungary, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Kliment Voroshilov]], refused to allow the Smallholders Party to form a government. Instead Voroshilov established a coalition government with the communists holding some of the key posts. Under Parliament, the leader of the Smallholders, Zolt\u00e1n Tildy, was named president and [[Ferenc Nagy]] prime minister in February 1946. M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi became deputy prime minister.\n\nDuring 1945 and 1946, the national currency, the [[Hungarian peng\u0151|peng\u0151]], was all but destroyed by the most ruinous [[hyperinflation]] in recorded history. The only way to restore sanity to the economy was a new currency, so the [[Hungarian forint|forint]] was reintroduced in 1946.\n\n[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] became [[Ministry of Interior (Hungary)|minister of the interior]] and in this post established the [[State Protection Authority|security police (\u00c1VO)]]. In February 1947 the police began arresting leaders of the Smallholders Party and the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|National Peasant Party]]. It also pressured both parties to expel those members who weren't willing to do the Communists' bidding as \"fascists.\" Several prominent figures in both parties escaped abroad. Later, R\u00e1kosi boasted that he had dealt with his partners in the government, one by one, [[Salami tactics|\"cutting them off like slices of salami.\"]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBy 1947, the power of the other parties in the coalition had been reduced in favour of the Communists, and they became the largest single party in [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1947|elections held that year]]. The Communists were the dominant partners in the coalition People's Independence Front government. Nagy was replaced as prime minister by the more pliable [[Lajos Dinny\u00e9s]].\n\nIn October 1947, R\u00e1kosi gave the leaders of the non-Communist parties an ultimatum: cooperate with a new, Communist-dominated coalition government or go into exile.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html Hungary: a country study].

Other opposition leaders such as [[Anna K\u00e9thly]], Ferenc Nagy and Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 were imprisoned or sent into exile.\n{{History of Hungary}}\nThe Republic of Hungary effectively ended in June 1948, when the Social Democrats were forced to merge with the Communists to form the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]]. However, the few independent-minded Social Democrats still left in the party were pushed out in short order. For all intents and purposes, this left the MDP as the MKP under a new name. In August, Tildy was forced out as president in favour of Social Democrat-turned-Communist [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d Szakasits]]. That December, Dinny\u00e9s was replaced as leader of the Smallholders and prime minister by the openly pro-Communist [[Istv\u00e1n Dobi]]. At the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1949|1949 elections]], voters were presented with a single list from the Communist-controlled Independent People's Front, which carried 95 percent of the vote. By this time, [[fellow traveler]]s had taken over the other parties and turned them into loyal partners of the Communists.\n\nOn 18 August 1949, the Parliament passed [[Hungarian Constitution of 1949|Hungary's first written constitution]] (1949/XX.) \u2013 a near-carbon copy of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936 constitution of the Soviet Union]].

[[Zolt\u00e1n Tildy]] became the provisional prime minister.\n[[File:Nagy Ferenc-MTI 1946.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ferenc Nagy]]\nIn [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|elections held in November 1945]], the [[Independent Smallholders' Party]] won 57% of the vote. The [[Hungarian Communist Party]], now under the leadership of [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]], two survivors from the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of 1919, received support from only 17% of the population. The Soviet commander in Hungary, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Kliment Voroshilov]], refused to allow the Smallholders Party to form a government. Instead Voroshilov established a coalition government with the communists holding some of the key posts. Under Parliament, the leader of the Smallholders, Zolt\u00e1n Tildy, was named president and [[Ferenc Nagy]] prime minister in February 1946. M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi became deputy prime minister.\n\nDuring 1945 and 1946, the national currency, the [[Hungarian peng\u0151|peng\u0151]], was all but destroyed by the most ruinous [[hyperinflation]] in recorded history. The only way to restore sanity to the economy was a new currency, so the [[Hungarian forint|forint]] was reintroduced in 1946.\n\n[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] became [[Ministry of Interior (Hungary)|minister of the interior]] and in this post established the [[State Protection Authority|security police (\u00c1VO)]]. In February 1947 the police began arresting leaders of the Smallholders Party and the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|National Peasant Party]]. It also pressured both parties to expel those members who weren't willing to do the Communists' bidding as \"fascists.\" Several prominent figures in both parties escaped abroad. Later, R\u00e1kosi boasted that he had dealt with his partners in the government, one by one, [[Salami tactics|\"cutting them off like slices of salami.\"]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBy 1947, the power of the other parties in the coalition had been reduced in favour of the Communists, and they became the largest single party in [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1947|elections held that year]]. The Communists were the dominant partners in the coalition People's Independence Front government. Nagy was replaced as prime minister by the more pliable [[Lajos Dinny\u00e9s]].\n\nIn October 1947, R\u00e1kosi gave the leaders of the non-Communist parties an ultimatum: cooperate with a new, Communist-dominated coalition government or go into exile.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html Hungary: a country study].  [[Library of Congress]] Federal Research Division, December 1989.</ref> The [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] effectively ceased to exist as an independent organization, and Independent Smallholders' Party secretary [[B\u00e9la Kov\u00e1cs (politician, 1908)|B\u00e9la Kov\u00e1cs]] was arrested and sent to Siberia. Other opposition leaders such as [[Anna K\u00e9thly]], Ferenc Nagy and Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 were imprisoned or sent into exile.\n{{History of Hungary}}\nThe Republic of Hungary effectively ended in June 1948, when the Social Democrats were forced to merge with the Communists to form the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]]. However, the few independent-minded Social Democrats still left in the party were pushed out in short order. For all intents and purposes, this left the MDP as the MKP under a new name. In August, Tildy was forced out as president in favour of Social Democrat-turned-Communist [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d Szakasits]]. That December, Dinny\u00e9s was replaced as leader of the Smallholders and prime minister by the openly pro-Communist [[Istv\u00e1n Dobi]]. At the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1949|1949 elections]], voters were presented with a single list from the Communist-controlled Independent People's Front, which carried 95 percent of the vote. By this time, [[fellow traveler]]s had taken over the other parties and turned them into loyal partners of the Communists.\n\nOn 18 August 1949, the Parliament passed [[Hungarian Constitution of 1949|Hungary's first written constitution]] (1949/XX.) \u2013 a near-carbon copy of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936 constitution of the Soviet Union]]. The name of the country became the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], \"the country of the workers and peasants\" where \"every authority is held by the working people\". Socialism was declared as the main goal of the nation. A new coat of arms was adopted with Communist symbols, such as the [[red star]], a [[hammer and sickle|hammer]], and an ear of wheat.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[History of Hungary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portalbar|Hungary}}\n\n{{Years in Hungary}}\n{{Hungary topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Republic of Hungary (1946-1949)}}\n[[Category:Modern history of Hungary|Second Hungarian Republic]]\n[[Category:Former republics|Hungary, Second]]\n[[Category:Territorial evolution of Hungary|Second Hungarian Republic]]\n[[Category:1940s in Hungary|Second Hungarian Republic]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1946]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1949]]\n[[Category:1946 establishments in Hungary]]\n[[Category:1949 disestablishments in Hungary]]\n[[Category:1946 in Hungary|Second Hungarian Republic]]\n[[Category:1947 in Hungary|.]]\n[[Category:1948 in Hungary|.]]\n[[Category:1949 in Hungary|Second Hungarian Republic]]\n[[Category:Former polities of the Cold War]]\n", "name_user": "ImperatorPublius", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Hungarian_Republic"}
