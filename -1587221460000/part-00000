But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.

But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.

{"title_page": "Formation (association football)", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Original research|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Leaflet advert for blackburn rovers match-1887.jpg|thumb|Programme for an 1887 game between [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. The players are arranged in 2\u20133\u20135 formation.]]\nIn [[association football]], the '''formation''' describes how the players in a team generally position themselves on the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]. Association football is a fluid and fast-moving game, and (with the exception of the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]) a player's position in a formation does not define their role as rigidly as for, for instance, a [[rugby football|rugby]] player, nor are there episodes in play where players must expressly line up in formation (as in [[gridiron football]]). Nevertheless, a player's position in a formation generally defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role, and whether they tend to play towards one side of the pitch or centrally.\n\nFormations are typically described by three or four numbers, which denote how many players are in each row of the formation from the most defensive to the most forward. For example, the popular \"4\u20135\u20131\" formation has four [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], five [[midfielder]]s, and a single [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. Different formations can be used depending on whether a team wishes to play more attacking or defensive football, and a team may switch formations between or during games for tactical reasons.\n\nThe choice of formation is typically made by a team's [[manager (association football)|manager]] or [[head coach]]. Skill and discipline on the part of the players is needed to implement a given formation effectively in professional football. Formations need to be chosen bearing in mind which players are available. Some formations were created to address deficits or strengths in different types of players.\n\nIn the early days of football, most team members would play in attacking roles, whereas modern formations almost always have more defenders than forwards.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nFormations are described by categorising the players (not including the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]) according to their positioning along (not across) the pitch, with the more defensive players given first. For example, 4\u20134\u20132 means four [[defender (association football)|defender]]s, four [[midfielder]]s, and two [[Forward (association football)|forwards]].\n\nTraditionally, those within the same category (for example the four midfielders in a 4\u20134\u20132) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, this is not the case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4\u20132\u20131\u20133, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4\u20133\u20133. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered to be a kind of 4\u20134\u20132 (specifically a 4\u20134\u20132 diamond, referring to the lozenge shape formed by the four midfielders).\n\nThe numbering system was not present until the 4\u20132\u20134 system was developed in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Choice and uses of formations==\nThe choice of formation is often related to the type of players available to the coach.\n\n*'''Narrow formations'''. Teams with a surfeit of central midfielders, or teams who attack best through the centre, may choose to adopt narrow formations such as the 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132 or the 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 which allow teams to field up to four or five central midfielders in the team. Narrow formations, however, depend on the full-backs (the flank players in the \"4\") to provide width and to advance upfield as frequently as possible to supplement the attack in wide areas.\n*'''Wide formations'''. Teams with a surfeit of forwards and wingers may choose to adopt formations such as 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20133\u20133, which commit forwards and wingers high up the pitch. Wide formations allow the attacking team to stretch play and cause the defending team to cover more ground.\n\nTeams may change formations during a game to aid their cause:\n*'''Change to attacking formations'''. When chasing a game for a desirable result, teams tend to sacrifice a defensive player or a midfield player for a forward in order to chase a result. An example of such a change is a change from 4\u20135\u20131 to 4\u20134\u20132, 3\u20135\u20132 to 3\u20134\u20133, or even 5\u20133\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133.\n*'''Change to defensive formations'''. When a team is in the lead, or wishes to protect the scoreline of a game, the coach may choose to revert to a more defensive structure by removing a forward for a more defensive player. The extra player in defence or midfield adds solidity by giving the team more legs to chase opponents and recover possession. An example of such a change is a change from 4\u20134\u20132 to 5\u20133\u20132, 3\u20135\u20132 to 4\u20135\u20131, or even 4\u20134\u20132 to 5\u20134\u20131.\n\nFormations can be deceptive in analysing a particular team's style of play. For instance, a team that plays a nominally attacking 4\u20133\u20133 formation can quickly revert to a 4\u20135\u20131 if a coach instructs two of the three forwards to track back in midfield.\n\n==Early formations==\nIn the football matches of the 19th century, defensive football was not played, and the line-ups reflected the all-attacking nature of these games.\n\nIn the [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international game]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[England national football team|England]] on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1\u20131\u20138 or 1\u20132\u20137 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2\u20132\u20136 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, and one or two players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0\u20130 draw.\n\n==Classic formations==\n\n===2\u20133\u20135 (''Pyramid'') {{anchor|2\u20133\u20135 (The Pyramid)}}===\n[[File:2-3-5 (pyramid).svg|thumb|upright|The Pyramid formation]]\n\nThe first long-term successful formation was first recorded in 1880.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Brenden|title=From Sheffield with Love|page=83|publisher=SportsBooks Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7}}</ref> In ''Association Football'', however, published by Caxton in 1960, the following appears in Vol II, page 432:\n\"Wrexham ... the first winner of the Welsh Cup in 1877 ... for the first time certainly in Wales and probably in Britain, a team played three half-backs and five forwards ...\"\n\nThe 2\u20133\u20135 was originally known as the \"Pyramid\", with the numerical formation being referenced retrospectively. By the 1890s, it was the standard formation in England and had spread all over the world. With some variations, it was used by most top level teams up to the 1930s.\n\nFor the first time, a balance between attacking and defending was reached. When defending, the two defenders (full-backs), would zonally mark the opponent forwards (mainly the central trio), while the midfielders (halfbacks) would fill the gaps (usually marking the opposing wingers or inside forwards).\n\nThe centre halfback had a key role in both helping to organise the team's attack and marking the opponent's centre forward, supposedly one of their most dangerous players.\n\nThis formation was used by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]] to win the 1924 and 1928 Olympic Games and also the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIt was this formation which gave rise to the convention of shirt numbers increasing from the back and the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/UnifNosNames.html |title=England's Uniforms&nbsp;\u2014 Shirt Numbers and Names |publisher=Englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Danubian School====\nThe Danubian School of football is a modification of the 2\u20133\u20135 formation in which the centre forward plays in a more withdrawn position. As played by the Austrians, Czechs and Hungarians in the 1920s, it was taken to its peak by the Austrians in the 1930s. It relied on short-passing and individual skills. This school was heavily influenced by the likes of Hugo Meisl and [[Jimmy Hogan]], the English coach who visited Austria at the time.\n\n====Metodo (2\u20133\u20132\u20133)====\n[[File:2-3-2-3 formation.svg|thumb|upright|Metodo formation]]\nThe Metodo was devised by [[Vittorio Pozzo]], coach of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,398055,00.html |title=Knowledge Unlimited: What a refreshing tactic (November 15, 2000) |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=10 July 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Sean |last=Ingle}}</ref> It was a derivation of the Danubian School. The system was based on the 2\u20133\u20135 formation; Pozzo realised that his half-backs would need some more support in order to be superior to the opponents' midfield, so he pulled two of the forwards to just in front of midfield, creating a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 formation. This created a stronger defence than previous systems, as well as allowing effective counter-attacks. The Italian national team won back-to-back [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] using this system. It has been argued that [[Pep Guardiola]]'s [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] used a modern version of this formation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/26/the-question-barcelona-reinventing-w-w |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |title=The Question: Are Barcelona reinventing the W-W formation? |date=26 October 2010 }}</ref> This formation is also similar to the standard in [[table football]], featuring two defenders, five midfielders and three strikers (which cannot be altered as the \"players\" are mounted on axles).\n\n===WM===\n[[File:3-2-2-3 formation.svg|thumb|upright|left|WM formation]]\nThe WM system, known for the shapes described by the positions of the players, was created in the mid-1920s by [[Herbert Chapman]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to counter a change in the [[Offside (association football)|offside law]] in 1925. The change had reduced the number of opposition players that attackers needed between themselves and the goal-line from three to two. This led to the introduction of a centre-back to stop the opposing centre-forward, and tried to balance defensive and offensive playing. The formation became so successful that by the late-1930s most English clubs had adopted the WM. Retrospectively, the WM has either been described as a 3\u20132\u20135 or as a 3\u20134\u20133, or more precisely a 3\u20132\u20132\u20133 reflecting the letters which symbolised it. The gap in the centre of the formation between the two [[Wing half|wing halves]] and the two inside forwards allowed Arsenal to counter-attack effectively. The WM was subsequently adapted by several English sides, but none could apply it in quite the same way Chapman had. This was mainly due to the comparative rarity of players like [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] in the English game. He was one of the earliest playmakers in the history of the game, and the hub around which Chapman's Arsenal revolved. In 2016, new manager [[Patrick Vieira]], a former Arsenal player, brought the WM formation to [[New York City FC]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Araos|first1=Christian|title=NYCFC comfortable in unconventional formation|url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/nycfc-comfortable-in-unconventional-formation-45653/|publisher=Empire of Soccer|accessdate=12 May 2016}} ref} the maker of the formation said i wanted to play that position\n\n===WW===\nThe WW was a development of the WM created by the Hungarian coach [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]] who turned the 3\u20132\u20135 WM into a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 by effectively turning the M \"upside down\".<ref name=\"sebes\">{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cc/hun/sebes.html |title=Guszt\u00e1v Sebes (biography) |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=10 July 2006 }}</ref> The lack of an effective centre-forward in his team necessitated moving this player back to midfield to create a playmaker, with a midfielder instructed to focus on defence. This created a 2\u20133\u20131\u20134, which morphed into a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 when the team lost possession, and was described by some as a kind of genetic link between the WM and the 4\u20132\u20134. This formation was successfully used by fellow countryman [[Guszt\u00e1v Sebes]] in the [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]] of the early 1950s.\n\n===3\u20133\u20134===\nThe 3\u20133\u20134 formation was similar to the WW, with the notable exception of having an inside-forward (as opposed to centre-forward) deployed as a midfield schemer alongside the two wing-halves. This formation would be commonplace during the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the best exponents of the system was the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] double-winning side of 1961, which deployed a midfield of [[Danny Blanchflower]], [[John White (footballer, born 1937)|John White]] and [[Dave Mackay]]. [[FC Porto|Porto]] won the [[2005\u201306 Primeira Liga]] using this unusual formation under [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Co Adriaanse]].\n\n===4\u20132\u20134===\n[[File:4-2-4 formation.svg|thumb|upright|The 4\u20132\u20134 formation]]\nThe 4\u20132\u20134 formation attempts to combine a strong attack with a strong defence, and was conceived as a reaction to WM's stiffness. It could also be considered a further development of the WW. The 4\u20132\u20134 was the first formation to be described using numbers.\n\nWhile the initial developments leading to the 4\u20132\u20134 were devised by [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]], the credit for creating the 4\u20132\u20134 lies with two people: [[Fl\u00e1vio Costa]], the Brazilian national coach in the early 1950s, as well as another Hungarian, [[B\u00e9la Guttman]].

The fourth defender increased the number of defensive players but mostly allowed them to be closer together, thus enabling effective cooperation among them, the point being that a stronger defence would allow an even stronger attack.\n\nThe relatively empty midfield relied on defenders that should now be able not only to steal the ball, but also hold it, pass it or even run with it and start an attack. So this formation required that all players, including defenders, are somehow skilful and with initiative, making it a perfect fit for the Brazilian player's mind. The 4\u20132\u20134 needed a high level of tactical awareness, as having only two midfielders could lead to defensive problems. The system was also fluid enough to allow the formation to change throughout play.\n\n4\u20132\u20134 was first used with success at club level in Brazil by [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] and [[Santos FC|Santos]], and was used by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in their wins at [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] and [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], both featuring [[Pel\u00e9]], and [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]], the latter of which played in 1958 and coached in 1970. The formation was quickly adopted throughout the world after the Brazilian success. Under the management of [[Jock Stein]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] won the [[1966\u201367 European Cup]] and reached the [[1970 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1969\u201370 European Cup]] using this formation.\n\n==Common modern formations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:auto;\"\n|+ '''Common modern formations'''\n| <gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Association football 4-4-2 formation.svg|4\u20134\u20132 formation\nFile:Association football 4-3-3 formation.svg|4\u20133\u20133 formation\nFile:Association football 4-4-2 diamond formation.svg|4\u20134\u20132 diamond formation\nFile:Association football 4-4-1-1 formation.svg|4\u20134\u20131\u20131 formation\nFile:4-3-2-1.gif|4\u20133\u20132\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 5-3-2 formation.svg|5\u20133\u20132 formation\nFile:Association football 5-3-2 sweeper formation.svg|5\u20133\u20132 sweeper formation\nFile:soccer formation 3-4-3.svg|3\u20134\u20133 formation\nFile:3-5-2DV.jpg|3\u20135\u20132 formation\nFile:3-6-1.jpg|3\u20136\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 4-5-1 formation.svg|4\u20135\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 4-2-3-1 formation.svg|4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 5-4-1 formation.svg|5\u20134\u20131 formation\nFile:Association_football_4-4-2_magic_square.png|4-2-2-2 formation\n\n<!-- missing image File:4-2-2-2.gif|4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation -->\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe following formations are used in modern football.

The system was most prominently used during the [[2009\u201310 Fulham F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]] by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with midfielder [[Zolt\u00e1n Gera]] playing behind forward [[Bobby Zamora]] as they upset many teams across Europe en route to the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final]].\n\n===4\u20133\u20133===\nThe 4\u20133\u20133 was a development of the 4\u20132\u20134, and was played by the Brazilian national team in the 1962 World Cup, although a 4\u20133\u20133 had also previously been used by the Uruguay national team in the 1950 and 1954 World Cups. The extra player in midfield allows a stronger defence, and the midfield could be staggered for different effects. The three midfielders normally play closely together to protect the defence, and move laterally across the field as a coordinated unit. The three forwards split across the field to spread the attack, and may be expected to mark the opposition full-backs as opposed to doubling back to assist their own full-backs, as do the wide midfielders in a 4\u20134\u20132. When used from the start of a game, this formation is widely regarded as encouraging expansive play, and should not be confused with the practice of modifying a 4\u20134\u20132 by bringing on an extra forward to replace a midfield player when behind in the latter stages of a game. This formation is suited for a short passing game and useful for ball retention.\n\nA staggered 4\u20133\u20133 involving a defensive midfielder (usually numbered four or six) and two attacking midfielders (numbered eight and ten) was commonplace in Italy, Argentina, and Uruguay during the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian variety of 4\u20133\u20133 was simply a modification of WM, by converting one of the two wing-halves to a ''[[libero (football)|libero]]'' (sweeper), whereas the Argentine and Uruguayan formations were derived from 2\u20133\u20135 and retained the notional attacking centre-half. The national team that made this famous was the Dutch team of the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, even though the team won neither.\n\nIn club football, the team that brought this formation to the forefront was the famous [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] team of the early 1970s, which won three European Cups with [[Johan Cruyff]], and [[Zden\u011bk Zeman]] with [[Foggia Calcio|Foggia]] in Italy during the late 1980s, where he completely revitalised the movement supporting this formation. It was also the formation with which Norwegian manager [[Nils Arne Eggen]] won 15 [[Norwegian Premier League|Norwegian league]] titles.\n\nMost teams using this formation now use the specialist [[defensive midfielder]]. Recent famous examples include the Porto and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] teams coached by [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]], as well as the Barcelona team under [[Pep Guardiola]]. Mourinho has also been credited with bringing this formation to England in his first stint with Chelsea, and it is commonly used by Guardiola's [[Manchester City]].\n\n====4\u20133\u20131\u20132====\nA variation of the 4\u20133\u20133 wherein a striker gives way to a central attacking midfielder. The formation focuses on the attacking midfielder moving play through the centre with the strikers on either side. It is a much narrower setup in comparison to the 4\u20133\u20133 and is usually dependent on the \"1\" to create chances. Examples of sides which won trophies using this formation were the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup]] and [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League]] winner Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Porto side; Carlo Ancelotti's [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League]] and [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] champion Milan, and [[2009\u201310 Premier League]] winner Chelsea. This formation was also adopted by [[Massimiliano Allegri]] for the [[2010\u201311 Serie A]] title-winning season for Milan. It was also the favoured formation of [[Maurizio Sarri]] during his time at Empoli between 2012 and 2015, during which time they won promotion to Serie A and subsequently avoided relegation, finishing 15th in the [[2014\u201315 Serie A]] season.\n\n====4\u20131\u20132\u20133====\nA variation of the 4\u20133\u20133 with a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and a fluid front three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomkinstimes.com/2014/01/tactics-for-beginners-no-14/|title=Tactics for Beginners \u2013 No.14 \u2013 The Tomkins Times|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===4\u20134\u20132 diamond or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132===\nThe 4\u20134\u20132 diamond (also described as 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132) staggers the midfield.

The 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 gives a strong presence in the forward middle of the pitch and is considered to be an attacking formation. Opposing teams with fast wingers and strong passing abilities can try to overwhelm the 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 with fast attacks on the wings of the pitch before the three offensive midfielders can fall back to help their defensive line.

Another example of the 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 in use was the England national team at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], managed by [[Alf Ramsey]].\n\n===4\u20133\u20132\u20131 (the \"Christmas Tree\" formation)===\nThe 4\u20133\u20132\u20131, commonly described as the \"[[Christmas Tree]]\" formation, has another forward brought on for a midfielder to play \"in the hole\", so leaving two forwards slightly behind the most forward striker.\n\n[[Terry Venables]] and [[Christian Gross]] used this formation during their time in charge of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Since then, the formation has lost its popularity in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/13/louis-van-gaal-united-tinker-table-premier-league|title=The Premier League tinker table and formation popularity in 2014-15 - Conrad Leach|first=Conrad|last=Leach|date=13 March 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref> It is, however, most known for being the formation Carlo Ancelotti used on-and-off during his time as a coach of Milan.\n\nIn this approach, the middle of the three central midfielders act as a playmaker while one of the attacking midfielders plays in a free role. However, it is also common for the three midfielders to be energetic shuttlers, providing for the individual talent of the two [[attacking midfielder]]s ahead. The \"Christmas Tree\" formation is considered a relatively narrow formation and depends on full-backs to provide presence in wide areas. The formation is also relatively fluid. During open play, one of the side central midfielders may drift to the flank to add additional presence.\n\n===5\u20133\u20132===\nThis formation has three central defenders, possibly with one acting as a [[sweeper (association football)|sweeper]].

Having only three dedicated defenders means that if the opposing team breaks through the midfield, they will have a greater chance to score than with a more conventional defensive configuration, such as 4\u20135\u20131 or 4\u20134\u20132. However, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack. This formation is used by more offensive-minded teams. The formation was famously used by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] under [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] during the second half of the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] to come back from a three-goal deficit.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nEx-Juventus and Italy coach Antonio Conte successfully implemented the 3\u20134\u20133 at Chelsea during the [[2016\u201317 Premier League]] season, leading the club to the league title and an [[2017 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].

Because of this, the central midfielders tends to remain further back in order to help prevent counter-attacks. It also differs from the classical 3\u20135\u20132 of the WW by having a non-staggered midfield. There are several coaches claiming to be the inventors of this formation, but the first to successfully employ it at the highest level was [[Carlos Bilardo]], who led [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] to win the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] using the 3\u20135\u20132.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/19/argentina-napoli |title=The Question: is 3\u20135\u20132 dead? |accessdate=19 November 2008|last=Wilson |first=Jonathan|date=19 November 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref> The high point of the 3\u20135\u20132's influence was the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], with both finalists, Bilardo's Argentina and [[Franz Beckenbauer]]'s [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] employing it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/19/argentina-napoli |title=The Question: is 3\u20135\u20132 dead? |accessdate=19 November 2008|last=Wilson |first=Jonathan|date=19 November 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref> \n\nAlthough it had fallen out of favour with most coaches who now prefer four at the back, it had a renaissance in both club and international football in the 2010s.

[[Martin O'Neill]] successfully used this formation during the early years of his reign as Celtic manager, noticeably taking them to the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\n===3\u20136\u20131===\nThis uncommon modern formation focuses on ball possession in the midfield. In fact, it is very rare to see it as an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or tie score. Its more common variants are 3\u20134\u20132\u20131 or 3\u20134\u20133 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on assisting with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down the clock. On the other hand, when the team is losing, at least one of the playmakers will more frequently play on the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. [[Steve Sampson]] (for the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]) and [[Guus Hiddink]] (for [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]) are two of the few coaches who have used this formation.\n\n===4\u20135\u20131===\n4\u20135\u20131 is a defensive formation; however, if the two midfield [[Winger (sports)#Association football|wingers]] play a more attacking role, it can be likened to 4\u20133\u20133. The formation can be used to grind out 0\u20130 draws or preserve a lead, as the packing of the centre midfield makes it difficult for the opposition to build up play.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/skillsandtactics/tp/formations.htm |work=worldsoccer.about.com |title=Formations:A Guide to Formations |accessdate=20 August 2014 }}</ref> Because of the \"closeness\" of the midfield, the opposing team's forwards will often be starved of possession. Due to the lone striker, however, the centre of the midfield does have the responsibility of pushing forward as well. The defensive midfielder will often control the pace of the game.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/rules_and_equipment/4197702.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Formations: 4\u20135\u20131 |date=1 September 2005 |accessdate=2 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===4\u20132\u20133\u20131===\nThis formation is widely used by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, it is quite a flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defence, this formation is similar to either the 4\u20135\u20131 or 4\u20134\u20131\u20131. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defence will be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using [[Inverted Winger|inverted wingers]] or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150822072251/http://thefalse9.com/2013/11/football-tactics-for-beginnersthe-4-2-3-1.html]\n\nAt international level, this formation is used by the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian]], [[French national football team|French]], Dutch and German national teams in an asymmetric shape, and often with strikers as wide midfielders or inverted wingers. The formation is also currently used by Brazil as an alternative to the 4\u20132\u20134 formation of the late 1950s to 1970. Implemented similarly to how the original 4\u20132\u20134 was used back then, use of this formation in this manner is very offensive, creating a six-man attack and a six-man defence tactical layout. The front four attackers are arranged as a pair of wide forwards and a [[playmaker]] forward who play in support of a lone striker.\n[[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] also considers the Brazil 1970 football team he coached as pioneers of 4\u20132\u20133\u20131.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/22872_zagallo_at_80_-_a_legend_of_football.html|title=Zagallo at 80 \u2013 A legend of football}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, with full-backs having ever more increasing attacking roles, the wide players (be they deep lying forwards, inverted wingers, attacking wide midfielders) have been tasked with the defensive responsibility to track and pin down the opposition full-backs.\n\nThis formation has been very frequently used by managers all over the world in the modern game. One particularly effective use of it was Liverpool under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who deployed [[Javier Mascherano]], [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] in central midfield, with Gerrard acting in a more advanced role in order to link up with [[Fernando Torres]], who acted as the central striker. Another notable example at club level is [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] under [[Jupp Heynckes]].\n\n===4\u20136\u20130===\nA highly unconventional formation, the 4\u20136\u20130 is an evolution of the [[#4\u20132\u20133\u20131|4\u20132\u20133\u20131]] or [[#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133]] in which the centre forward is exchanged for a player who normally plays as a ''trequartista'' (that is, in the \"hole\").

Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff brought it to even further attacking extremes and the system eventually found its way to Barcelona, where players such as [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] and [[Xavi]] were reared into 3\u20133\u20131\u20133's philosophy. It demands intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponent's half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff's variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. [[Marcelo Bielsa]] has used the system with some success with Argentina's and [[Chile national football team|Chile]]'s national teams and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to use the system in competition today. [[Diego Simeone]] had also tried it occasionally at [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]].\n\n===3\u20133\u20133\u20131===\nThe 3\u20133\u20133\u20131 system is a very attacking formation and its compact nature is ideally suited for midfield domination and ball possession. It means a coach can field more attacking players and add extra strength through the spine of the team. The attacking three are usually two [[wing-back (association football)|wing-backs]] or wingers with the central player of the three occupying a central attacking midfield or second striker role behind the [[centre forward]]. The midfield three consists of two centre [[midfielder]]s ahead of one central defensive midfielder or alternatively one central midfielder and two defensive midfielders. The defensive three can consist of three [[centre back]]s or one centre back with a [[Full back (association football)|full back]] either side.\n\nThe 3\u20133\u20133\u20131 formation was used by [[Marcelo Bielsa]]'s Chile in the 2010 World Cup, with three centre-backs paired with two wing-backs and a holding player, although a variation is the practical hourglass, using three wide players, a narrow three, a wide three and a centre-forward.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/25/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league |title=The Question: How best for Manchester United to combat Barcelona? |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2012 |location=London |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson }}</ref>\n\n===4\u20132\u20131\u20133===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}\nThe somewhat unconventional 4\u20132\u20131\u20133 formation was developed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho during his time at [[Inter Milan]], including in the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final]]. By using captain [[Javier Zanetti]] and [[Esteban Cambiasso]] in holding midfield positions, he was able to push more players to attack. [[Wesley Sneijder]] filled the [[attacking midfield]] role and the front three operated as three strikers, rather than having a striker and one player on each wing. Using this formation, Mourinho won [[Treble (association football)|The Treble]] with Inter in only his second season in charge of the club.\n\nAs the system becomes more developed and flexible, small groups can be identified to work together in more efficient ways by giving them more specific and different roles within the same lines, and numbers like 4\u20132\u20131\u20133, 4\u20131\u20132\u20133 and even 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 occur.\n\nMany of the current systems have three different formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team in all parts of the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4\u20132\u20131\u20133 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may look exactly like a 4\u20132\u20131\u20133.\n\n==Incomplete formations==\nWhen a player is [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] (i.e. after being shown a [[Misconduct (association football)|red card]]) or leaves the field due to an injury or other reason with no ability to be replaced with a substitute teams generally fall back to defensive formations such as 4\u20134\u20131 or 5\u20133\u20131. Only when facing a negative result will a team with ten players play in a risky attacking formation such as 4\u20133\u20132 or even 4\u20132\u20133.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Association football tactics and skills]]\n*[[Association football positions]]\n*[[Catenaccio]]\n*[[Total Football]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197420.stm Introduction to formations] at [[BBC Sport]]\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/66m8IzSQX?url=http://www.nscaa.com/ The development of early formations] from [[National Soccer Coaches Association of America]]\n\n{{Association football}}\n{{Association football terminology}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Formation (Association Football)}}\n[[Category:Association football tactics and skills]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Original research|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Leaflet advert for blackburn rovers match-1887.jpg|thumb|Programme for an 1887 game between [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. The players are arranged in 2\u20133\u20135 formation.]]\nIn [[association football]], the '''formation''' describes how the players in a team generally position themselves on the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]. Association football is a fluid and fast-moving game, and (with the exception of the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]) a player's position in a formation does not define their role as rigidly as for, for instance, a [[rugby football|rugby]] player, nor are there episodes in play where players must expressly line up in formation (as in [[gridiron football]]). Nevertheless, a player's position in a formation generally defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role, and whether they tend to play towards one side of the pitch or centrally.\n\nFormations are typically described by three or four numbers, which denote how many players are in each row of the formation from the most defensive to the most forward. For example, the popular \"4\u20135\u20131\" formation has four [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], five [[midfielder]]s, and a single [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. Different formations can be used depending on whether a team wishes to play more attacking or defensive football, and a team may switch formations between or during games for tactical reasons.\n\nThe choice of formation is typically made by a team's [[manager (association football)|manager]] or [[head coach]]. Skill and discipline on the part of the players is needed to implement a given formation effectively in professional football. Formations need to be chosen bearing in mind which players are available. Some formations were created to address deficits or strengths in different types of players.\n\nIn the early days of football, most team members would play in attacking roles, whereas modern formations almost always have more defenders than forwards.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nFormations are described by categorising the players (not including the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]) according to their positioning along (not across) the pitch, with the more defensive players given first. For example, 4\u20134\u20132 means four [[defender (association football)|defender]]s, four [[midfielder]]s, and two [[Forward (association football)|forwards]].\n\nTraditionally, those within the same category (for example the four midfielders in a 4\u20134\u20132) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, this is not the case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4\u20132\u20131\u20133, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4\u20133\u20133. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered to be a kind of 4\u20134\u20132 (specifically a 4\u20134\u20132 diamond, referring to the lozenge shape formed by the four midfielders).\n\nThe numbering system was not present until the 4\u20132\u20134 system was developed in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Choice and uses of formations==\nThe choice of formation is often related to the type of players available to the coach.\n\n*'''Narrow formations'''. Teams with a surfeit of central midfielders, or teams who attack best through the centre, may choose to adopt narrow formations such as the 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132 or the 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 which allow teams to field up to four or five central midfielders in the team. Narrow formations, however, depend on the full-backs (the flank players in the \"4\") to provide width and to advance upfield as frequently as possible to supplement the attack in wide areas.\n*'''Wide formations'''. Teams with a surfeit of forwards and wingers may choose to adopt formations such as 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20133\u20133, which commit forwards and wingers high up the pitch. Wide formations allow the attacking team to stretch play and cause the defending team to cover more ground.\n\nTeams may change formations during a game to aid their cause:\n*'''Change to attacking formations'''. When chasing a game for a desirable result, teams tend to sacrifice a defensive player or a midfield player for a forward in order to chase a result. An example of such a change is a change from 4\u20135\u20131 to 4\u20134\u20132, 3\u20135\u20132 to 3\u20134\u20133, or even 5\u20133\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133.\n*'''Change to defensive formations'''. When a team is in the lead, or wishes to protect the scoreline of a game, the coach may choose to revert to a more defensive structure by removing a forward for a more defensive player. The extra player in defence or midfield adds solidity by giving the team more legs to chase opponents and recover possession. An example of such a change is a change from 4\u20134\u20132 to 5\u20133\u20132, 3\u20135\u20132 to 4\u20135\u20131, or even 4\u20134\u20132 to 5\u20134\u20131.\n\nFormations can be deceptive in analysing a particular team's style of play. For instance, a team that plays a nominally attacking 4\u20133\u20133 formation can quickly revert to a 4\u20135\u20131 if a coach instructs two of the three forwards to track back in midfield.\n\n==Early formations==\nIn the football matches of the 19th century, defensive football was not played, and the line-ups reflected the all-attacking nature of these games.\n\nIn the [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international game]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[England national football team|England]] on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1\u20131\u20138 or 1\u20132\u20137 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2\u20132\u20136 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, and one or two players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0\u20130 draw.\n\n==Classic formations==\n\n===2\u20133\u20135 (''Pyramid'') {{anchor|2\u20133\u20135 (The Pyramid)}}===\n[[File:2-3-5 (pyramid).svg|thumb|upright|The Pyramid formation]]\n\nThe first long-term successful formation was first recorded in 1880.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Brenden|title=From Sheffield with Love|page=83|publisher=SportsBooks Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7}}</ref> In ''Association Football'', however, published by Caxton in 1960, the following appears in Vol II, page 432:\n\"Wrexham ... the first winner of the Welsh Cup in 1877 ... for the first time certainly in Wales and probably in Britain, a team played three half-backs and five forwards ...\"\n\nThe 2\u20133\u20135 was originally known as the \"Pyramid\", with the numerical formation being referenced retrospectively. By the 1890s, it was the standard formation in England and had spread all over the world. With some variations, it was used by most top level teams up to the 1930s.\n\nFor the first time, a balance between attacking and defending was reached. When defending, the two defenders (full-backs), would zonally mark the opponent forwards (mainly the central trio), while the midfielders (halfbacks) would fill the gaps (usually marking the opposing wingers or inside forwards).\n\nThe centre halfback had a key role in both helping to organise the team's attack and marking the opponent's centre forward, supposedly one of their most dangerous players.\n\nThis formation was used by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]] to win the 1924 and 1928 Olympic Games and also the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIt was this formation which gave rise to the convention of shirt numbers increasing from the back and the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/UnifNosNames.html |title=England's Uniforms&nbsp;\u2014 Shirt Numbers and Names |publisher=Englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Danubian School====\nThe Danubian School of football is a modification of the 2\u20133\u20135 formation in which the centre forward plays in a more withdrawn position. As played by the Austrians, Czechs and Hungarians in the 1920s, it was taken to its peak by the Austrians in the 1930s. It relied on short-passing and individual skills. This school was heavily influenced by the likes of Hugo Meisl and [[Jimmy Hogan]], the English coach who visited Austria at the time.\n\n====Metodo (2\u20133\u20132\u20133)====\n[[File:2-3-2-3 formation.svg|thumb|upright|Metodo formation]]\nThe Metodo was devised by [[Vittorio Pozzo]], coach of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,398055,00.html |title=Knowledge Unlimited: What a refreshing tactic (November 15, 2000) |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=10 July 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Sean |last=Ingle}}</ref> It was a derivation of the Danubian School. The system was based on the 2\u20133\u20135 formation; Pozzo realised that his half-backs would need some more support in order to be superior to the opponents' midfield, so he pulled two of the forwards to just in front of midfield, creating a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 formation. This created a stronger defence than previous systems, as well as allowing effective counter-attacks. The Italian national team won back-to-back [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] using this system. It has been argued that [[Pep Guardiola]]'s [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] used a modern version of this formation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/26/the-question-barcelona-reinventing-w-w |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |title=The Question: Are Barcelona reinventing the W-W formation? |date=26 October 2010 }}</ref> This formation is also similar to the standard in [[table football]], featuring two defenders, five midfielders and three strikers (which cannot be altered as the \"players\" are mounted on axles).\n\n===WM===\n[[File:3-2-2-3 formation.svg|thumb|upright|left|WM formation]]\nThe WM system, known for the shapes described by the positions of the players, was created in the mid-1920s by [[Herbert Chapman]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to counter a change in the [[Offside (association football)|offside law]] in 1925. The change had reduced the number of opposition players that attackers needed between themselves and the goal-line from three to two. This led to the introduction of a centre-back to stop the opposing centre-forward, and tried to balance defensive and offensive playing. The formation became so successful that by the late-1930s most English clubs had adopted the WM. Retrospectively, the WM has either been described as a 3\u20132\u20135 or as a 3\u20134\u20133, or more precisely a 3\u20132\u20132\u20133 reflecting the letters which symbolised it. The gap in the centre of the formation between the two [[Wing half|wing halves]] and the two inside forwards allowed Arsenal to counter-attack effectively. The WM was subsequently adapted by several English sides, but none could apply it in quite the same way Chapman had. This was mainly due to the comparative rarity of players like [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] in the English game. He was one of the earliest playmakers in the history of the game, and the hub around which Chapman's Arsenal revolved. In 2016, new manager [[Patrick Vieira]], a former Arsenal player, brought the WM formation to [[New York City FC]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Araos|first1=Christian|title=NYCFC comfortable in unconventional formation|url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/nycfc-comfortable-in-unconventional-formation-45653/|publisher=Empire of Soccer|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===WW===\nThe WW was a development of the WM created by the Hungarian coach [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]] who turned the 3\u20132\u20135 WM into a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 by effectively turning the M \"upside down\".<ref name=\"sebes\">{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cc/hun/sebes.html |title=Guszt\u00e1v Sebes (biography) |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=10 July 2006 }}</ref> The lack of an effective centre-forward in his team necessitated moving this player back to midfield to create a playmaker, with a midfielder instructed to focus on defence. This created a 2\u20133\u20131\u20134, which morphed into a 2\u20133\u20132\u20133 when the team lost possession, and was described by some as a kind of genetic link between the WM and the 4\u20132\u20134. This formation was successfully used by fellow countryman [[Guszt\u00e1v Sebes]] in the [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]] of the early 1950s.\n\n===3\u20133\u20134===\nThe 3\u20133\u20134 formation was similar to the WW, with the notable exception of having an inside-forward (as opposed to centre-forward) deployed as a midfield schemer alongside the two wing-halves. This formation would be commonplace during the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the best exponents of the system was the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] double-winning side of 1961, which deployed a midfield of [[Danny Blanchflower]], [[John White (footballer, born 1937)|John White]] and [[Dave Mackay]]. [[FC Porto|Porto]] won the [[2005\u201306 Primeira Liga]] using this unusual formation under [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Co Adriaanse]].\n\n===4\u20132\u20134===\n[[File:4-2-4 formation.svg|thumb|upright|The 4\u20132\u20134 formation]]\nThe 4\u20132\u20134 formation attempts to combine a strong attack with a strong defence, and was conceived as a reaction to WM's stiffness. It could also be considered a further development of the WW. The 4\u20132\u20134 was the first formation to be described using numbers.\n\nWhile the initial developments leading to the 4\u20132\u20134 were devised by [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]], the credit for creating the 4\u20132\u20134 lies with two people: [[Fl\u00e1vio Costa]], the Brazilian national coach in the early 1950s, as well as another Hungarian, [[B\u00e9la Guttman]].

The fourth defender increased the number of defensive players but mostly allowed them to be closer together, thus enabling effective cooperation among them, the point being that a stronger defence would allow an even stronger attack.\n\nThe relatively empty midfield relied on defenders that should now be able not only to steal the ball, but also hold it, pass it or even run with it and start an attack. So this formation required that all players, including defenders, are somehow skilful and with initiative, making it a perfect fit for the Brazilian player's mind. The 4\u20132\u20134 needed a high level of tactical awareness, as having only two midfielders could lead to defensive problems. The system was also fluid enough to allow the formation to change throughout play.\n\n4\u20132\u20134 was first used with success at club level in Brazil by [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] and [[Santos FC|Santos]], and was used by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in their wins at [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] and [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], both featuring [[Pel\u00e9]], and [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]], the latter of which played in 1958 and coached in 1970. The formation was quickly adopted throughout the world after the Brazilian success. Under the management of [[Jock Stein]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] won the [[1966\u201367 European Cup]] and reached the [[1970 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1969\u201370 European Cup]] using this formation.\n\n==Common modern formations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:auto;\"\n|+ '''Common modern formations'''\n| <gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Association football 4-4-2 formation.svg|4\u20134\u20132 formation\nFile:Association football 4-3-3 formation.svg|4\u20133\u20133 formation\nFile:Association football 4-4-2 diamond formation.svg|4\u20134\u20132 diamond formation\nFile:Association football 4-4-1-1 formation.svg|4\u20134\u20131\u20131 formation\nFile:4-3-2-1.gif|4\u20133\u20132\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 5-3-2 formation.svg|5\u20133\u20132 formation\nFile:Association football 5-3-2 sweeper formation.svg|5\u20133\u20132 sweeper formation\nFile:soccer formation 3-4-3.svg|3\u20134\u20133 formation\nFile:3-5-2DV.jpg|3\u20135\u20132 formation\nFile:3-6-1.jpg|3\u20136\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 4-5-1 formation.svg|4\u20135\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 4-2-3-1 formation.svg|4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation\nFile:Association football 5-4-1 formation.svg|5\u20134\u20131 formation\nFile:Association_football_4-4-2_magic_square.png|4-2-2-2 formation\n\n<!-- missing image File:4-2-2-2.gif|4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation -->\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe following formations are used in modern football.

The system was most prominently used during the [[2009\u201310 Fulham F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]] by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with midfielder [[Zolt\u00e1n Gera]] playing behind forward [[Bobby Zamora]] as they upset many teams across Europe en route to the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final]].\n\n===4\u20133\u20133===\nThe 4\u20133\u20133 was a development of the 4\u20132\u20134, and was played by the Brazilian national team in the 1962 World Cup, although a 4\u20133\u20133 had also previously been used by the Uruguay national team in the 1950 and 1954 World Cups. The extra player in midfield allows a stronger defence, and the midfield could be staggered for different effects. The three midfielders normally play closely together to protect the defence, and move laterally across the field as a coordinated unit. The three forwards split across the field to spread the attack, and may be expected to mark the opposition full-backs as opposed to doubling back to assist their own full-backs, as do the wide midfielders in a 4\u20134\u20132. When used from the start of a game, this formation is widely regarded as encouraging expansive play, and should not be confused with the practice of modifying a 4\u20134\u20132 by bringing on an extra forward to replace a midfield player when behind in the latter stages of a game. This formation is suited for a short passing game and useful for ball retention.\n\nA staggered 4\u20133\u20133 involving a defensive midfielder (usually numbered four or six) and two attacking midfielders (numbered eight and ten) was commonplace in Italy, Argentina, and Uruguay during the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian variety of 4\u20133\u20133 was simply a modification of WM, by converting one of the two wing-halves to a ''[[libero (football)|libero]]'' (sweeper), whereas the Argentine and Uruguayan formations were derived from 2\u20133\u20135 and retained the notional attacking centre-half. The national team that made this famous was the Dutch team of the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, even though the team won neither.\n\nIn club football, the team that brought this formation to the forefront was the famous [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] team of the early 1970s, which won three European Cups with [[Johan Cruyff]], and [[Zden\u011bk Zeman]] with [[Foggia Calcio|Foggia]] in Italy during the late 1980s, where he completely revitalised the movement supporting this formation. It was also the formation with which Norwegian manager [[Nils Arne Eggen]] won 15 [[Norwegian Premier League|Norwegian league]] titles.\n\nMost teams using this formation now use the specialist [[defensive midfielder]]. Recent famous examples include the Porto and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] teams coached by [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]], as well as the Barcelona team under [[Pep Guardiola]]. Mourinho has also been credited with bringing this formation to England in his first stint with Chelsea, and it is commonly used by Guardiola's [[Manchester City]].\n\n====4\u20133\u20131\u20132====\nA variation of the 4\u20133\u20133 wherein a striker gives way to a central attacking midfielder. The formation focuses on the attacking midfielder moving play through the centre with the strikers on either side. It is a much narrower setup in comparison to the 4\u20133\u20133 and is usually dependent on the \"1\" to create chances. Examples of sides which won trophies using this formation were the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup]] and [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League]] winner Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Porto side; Carlo Ancelotti's [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League]] and [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] champion Milan, and [[2009\u201310 Premier League]] winner Chelsea. This formation was also adopted by [[Massimiliano Allegri]] for the [[2010\u201311 Serie A]] title-winning season for Milan. It was also the favoured formation of [[Maurizio Sarri]] during his time at Empoli between 2012 and 2015, during which time they won promotion to Serie A and subsequently avoided relegation, finishing 15th in the [[2014\u201315 Serie A]] season.\n\n====4\u20131\u20132\u20133====\nA variation of the 4\u20133\u20133 with a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and a fluid front three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomkinstimes.com/2014/01/tactics-for-beginners-no-14/|title=Tactics for Beginners \u2013 No.14 \u2013 The Tomkins Times|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===4\u20134\u20132 diamond or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132===\nThe 4\u20134\u20132 diamond (also described as 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132) staggers the midfield.

This allows the remaining three midfielders to play further forward and more aggressively, and also allows them to pass back to their defensive mid when setting up a play or recovering from a counterattack. The 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 gives a strong presence in the forward middle of the pitch and is considered to be an attacking formation. Opposing teams with fast wingers and strong passing abilities can try to overwhelm the 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 with fast attacks on the wings of the pitch before the three offensive midfielders can fall back to help their defensive line. [[Valeriy Lobanovskiy]] is one of the most famous exponents of the formation, using it with [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], winning three European trophies in the process.

However, it is also common for the three midfielders to be energetic shuttlers, providing for the individual talent of the two [[attacking midfielder]]s ahead. The \"Christmas Tree\" formation is considered a relatively narrow formation and depends on full-backs to provide presence in wide areas. The formation is also relatively fluid.

[[Martin O'Neill]] successfully used this formation during the early years of his reign as Celtic manager, noticeably taking them to the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\n===3\u20136\u20131===\nThis uncommon modern formation focuses on ball possession in the midfield. In fact, it is very rare to see it as an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or tie score. Its more common variants are 3\u20134\u20132\u20131 or 3\u20134\u20133 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on assisting with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down the clock. On the other hand, when the team is losing, at least one of the playmakers will more frequently play on the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. [[Steve Sampson]] (for the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]) and [[Guus Hiddink]] (for [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]) are two of the few coaches who have used this formation.\n\n===4\u20135\u20131===\n4\u20135\u20131 is a defensive formation; however, if the two midfield [[Winger (sports)#Association football|wingers]] play a more attacking role, it can be likened to 4\u20133\u20133. The formation can be used to grind out 0\u20130 draws or preserve a lead, as the packing of the centre midfield makes it difficult for the opposition to build up play.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/skillsandtactics/tp/formations.htm |work=worldsoccer.about.com |title=Formations:A Guide to Formations |accessdate=20 August 2014 }}</ref> Because of the \"closeness\" of the midfield, the opposing team's forwards will often be starved of possession. Due to the lone striker, however, the centre of the midfield does have the responsibility of pushing forward as well. The defensive midfielder will often control the pace of the game.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/rules_and_equipment/4197702.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Formations: 4\u20135\u20131 |date=1 September 2005 |accessdate=2 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===4\u20132\u20133\u20131===\nThis formation is widely used by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, it is quite a flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defence, this formation is similar to either the 4\u20135\u20131 or 4\u20134\u20131\u20131. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defence will be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using [[Inverted Winger|inverted wingers]] or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150822072251/http://thefalse9.com/2013/11/football-tactics-for-beginnersthe-4-2-3-1.html]\n\nAt international level, this formation is used by the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian]], [[French national football team|French]], Dutch and German national teams in an asymmetric shape, and often with strikers as wide midfielders or inverted wingers. The formation is also currently used by Brazil as an alternative to the 4\u20132\u20134 formation of the late 1950s to 1970. Implemented similarly to how the original 4\u20132\u20134 was used back then, use of this formation in this manner is very offensive, creating a six-man attack and a six-man defence tactical layout. The front four attackers are arranged as a pair of wide forwards and a [[playmaker]] forward who play in support of a lone striker.\n[[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] also considers the Brazil 1970 football team he coached as pioneers of 4\u20132\u20133\u20131.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/22872_zagallo_at_80_-_a_legend_of_football.html|title=Zagallo at 80 \u2013 A legend of football}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, with full-backs having ever more increasing attacking roles, the wide players (be they deep lying forwards, inverted wingers, attacking wide midfielders) have been tasked with the defensive responsibility to track and pin down the opposition full-backs.\n\nThis formation has been very frequently used by managers all over the world in the modern game. One particularly effective use of it was Liverpool under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who deployed [[Javier Mascherano]], [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] in central midfield, with Gerrard acting in a more advanced role in order to link up with [[Fernando Torres]], who acted as the central striker. Another notable example at club level is [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] under [[Jupp Heynckes]].\n\n===4\u20136\u20130===\nA highly unconventional formation, the 4\u20136\u20130 is an evolution of the [[#4\u20132\u20133\u20131|4\u20132\u20133\u20131]] or [[#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133]] in which the centre forward is exchanged for a player who normally plays as a ''trequartista'' (that is, in the \"hole\").

As with the development of many formations, the origins and originators are uncertain, but arguably the first reference to a professional team adopting a similar formation is [[Anghel Iord\u0103nescu]]'s [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the 1994 World Cup Round of 16, when Romania won 3\u20132 against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/22/joy-of-six-counterattacking-goals|title=The Joy of Six: Counter-attacking goals|accessdate=25 March 2010|date=22 January 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Rob |last=Smyth }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1994/r2_rom_v_arg.html|title=ROMANIA&nbsp;\u2014 ARGENTINA 3\u20132 Match report}}</ref> The first team to adopt the formation systematically was [[Luciano Spalletti]]'s [[A.S.

Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff brought it to even further attacking extremes and the system eventually found its way to Barcelona, where players such as [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] and [[Xavi]] were reared into 3\u20133\u20131\u20133's philosophy. It demands intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponent's half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff's variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. [[Marcelo Bielsa]] has used the system with some success with Argentina's and [[Chile national football team|Chile]]'s national teams and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to use the system in competition today. [[Diego Simeone]] had also tried it occasionally at [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]].\n\n===3\u20133\u20133\u20131===\nThe 3\u20133\u20133\u20131 system is a very attacking formation and its compact nature is ideally suited for midfield domination and ball possession. It means a coach can field more attacking players and add extra strength through the spine of the team. The attacking three are usually two [[wing-back (association football)|wing-backs]] or wingers with the central player of the three occupying a central attacking midfield or second striker role behind the [[centre forward]]. The midfield three consists of two centre [[midfielder]]s ahead of one central defensive midfielder or alternatively one central midfielder and two defensive midfielders.

Using this formation, Mourinho won [[Treble (association football)|The Treble]] with Inter in only his second season in charge of the club.\n\nAs the system becomes more developed and flexible, small groups can be identified to work together in more efficient ways by giving them more specific and different roles within the same lines, and numbers like 4\u20132\u20131\u20133, 4\u20131\u20132\u20133 and even 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 occur.\n\nMany of the current systems have three different formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team in all parts of the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4\u20132\u20131\u20133 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may look exactly like a 4\u20132\u20131\u20133.\n\n==Incomplete formations==\nWhen a player is [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] (i.e. after being shown a [[Misconduct (association football)|red card]]) or leaves the field due to an injury or other reason with no ability to be replaced with a substitute teams generally fall back to defensive formations such as 4\u20134\u20131 or 5\u20133\u20131. Only when facing a negative result will a team with ten players play in a risky attacking formation such as 4\u20133\u20132 or even 4\u20132\u20133.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Association football tactics and skills]]\n*[[Association football positions]]\n*[[Catenaccio]]\n*[[Total Football]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197420.stm Introduction to formations] at [[BBC Sport]]\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/66m8IzSQX?url=http://www.nscaa.com/ The development of early formations] from [[National Soccer Coaches Association of America]]\n\n{{Association football}}\n{{Association football terminology}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Formation (Association Football)}}\n[[Category:Association football tactics and skills]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n", "name_user": "84.68.49.55", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eWM)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)"}

This may have been influenced by the fact that he had actually been a [[Prince of Greece and Denmark]] by birth, the use of which titles he had discontinued already. Although the [[Royal and noble ranks|princely title]] was omitted in the British [[Regency Acts#Regency Act 1953|Regency Act 1953]], and in Letters Patent of November 1953 appointing [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], it had been included in Letters Patent of 22 October 1948 conferring princely rank on children from Philip's marriage to Elizabeth. [[King]] [[George VI]], however, is believed to have been clear and intentional in having withheld the title of ''Prince'' from his future son-in-law.{{NoteTag|\"[[Home Office]], [[Whitehall]]. S.W.1. 28 February 1955. \"My dear George {Coldstream, [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]]}, We were speaking the other day about the designation of the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1948 the [[General Register Office]] consulted us about the way in which the birth of Prince Charles was to be registered. They sent over a suggested entry, in column 4 of which (name and surname of father) they had inserted: 'His Royal Highness Prince Philip'. I consulted [[Alan Lascelles|{Sir Alan} Lascelles]] [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Principal Private Secretary]] to the King on this and he laid my letter before [[George VI of the United Kingdom|The King]], together with the draft entry, I have in my possession the entry, as amended by The King in his own hand. The King amended column 4, name and surname of father, to read: \"''His Royal Highness Philip, Duke of Edinburgh''\".

Churchill preferred the title ''[[Prince Consort]]'', but the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Eden]], expressed a preference for ''Prince of the Realm''. While the Commonwealth Prime Ministers were assembled in London, Churchill was requested by the Queen to informally solicit their opinions on the matter of the Queen's husband's title. Canadian Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] was the only one to express \"misgivings\", while Philip insisted to the Queen that he objected to any enhancement of his title. The Queen thereafter contacted Churchill and told him to drop the matter.<ref name=veldephilip /> In 1955, the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|South African Prime Minister]] [[J. G. Strijdom]] belatedly made it known that the South African Cabinet objected to the title ''Prince of the Commonwealth''. When told, the Queen continued to express the wish that her husband's position be raised, but rejected the British Cabinet's recommendations of ''Prince Consort'' or ''Prince Royal''. The British Cabinet then suggested simply ''His Royal Highness the Prince'', but the Queen was advised that if she still preferred ''Prince of the Commonwealth'', her Private Secretary could write directly to the Commonwealth [[Governor-General|Governors-General]] for their response, though warning that if their consent was not unanimous the proposal could not go forward.\n\nThe matter appeared left until the publication on 8 February 1957 of an article by P. Wykeham-Bourne in ''The [[Evening Standard]]'' titled: \"Well, is it correct to say Prince Philip?\" A few days following, Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] reversed the advice of the Queen's previous ministers and formally recommended that the Queen reject ''the Prince'' in favour of ''Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Her other Realms and Territories'', only to change this advice, after she consented, to delete even the vague reference to the Commonwealth countries. Letters Patent were issued on 22 February 1957 giving the Duke the style and titular dignity of a Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (omitting the wording ''and Her other Realms and Territories''). According to the announcement in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', he should henceforth be known as ''His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh'',<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5558.asp |title = The Royal Family > Members of the Royal Family > HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh > Honours |publisher=Buckingham Palace |accessdate=18 October 2008 }}</ref> with the capitalised definite article normally restricted to the children of monarchs.<ref name=veldephilip />\n\nThe media cultivated speculation in early 2007 that the title of ''[[Prince Consort]]'' might be conferred to mark the royal couple's 60th wedding anniversary in November that year; however, this did not occur.\n\n====Order of Australia====\n[[File:Order of Australia.png|thumb|right|Insignia of Knight, Order of Australia]]\n\nPrince Philip's elevation in 2015 from [[Order of Australia|Companion]] to [[Knight of the Order of Australia|Knight]] of the [[Order of Australia]] caused  some political controversy in [[Australia]].

This may have been influenced by the fact that he had actually been a [[Prince of Greece and Denmark]] by birth, the use of which titles he had discontinued already. Although the [[Royal and noble ranks|princely title]] was omitted in the British [[Regency Acts#Regency Act 1953|Regency Act 1953]], and in Letters Patent of November 1953 appointing [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], it had been included in Letters Patent of 22 October 1948 conferring princely rank on children from Philip's marriage to Elizabeth. [[King]] [[George VI]], however, is believed to have been clear and intentional in having withheld the title of ''Prince'' from his future son-in-law.{{NoteTag|\"[[Home Office]], [[Whitehall]]. S.W.1. 28 February 1955. \"My dear George {Coldstream, [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]]}, We were speaking the other day about the designation of the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1948 the [[General Register Office]] consulted us about the way in which the birth of Prince Charles was to be registered. They sent over a suggested entry, in column 4 of which (name and surname of father) they had inserted: 'His Royal Highness Prince Philip'. I consulted [[Alan Lascelles|{Sir Alan} Lascelles]] [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Principal Private Secretary]] to the King on this and he laid my letter before [[George VI of the United Kingdom|The King]], together with the draft entry, I have in my possession the entry, as amended by The King in his own hand. The King amended column 4, name and surname of father, to read: \"''His Royal Highness Philip, Duke of Edinburgh''\".

Churchill preferred the title ''[[Prince Consort]]'', but the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Eden]], expressed a preference for ''Prince of the Realm''. While the Commonwealth Prime Ministers were assembled in London, Churchill was requested by the Queen to informally solicit their opinions on the matter of the Queen's husband's title. Canadian Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] was the only one to express \"misgivings\", while Philip insisted to the Queen that he objected to any enhancement of his title. The Queen thereafter contacted Churchill and told him to drop the matter.<ref name=veldephilip /> In 1955, the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|South African Prime Minister]] [[J. G. Strijdom]] belatedly made it known that the South African Cabinet objected to the title ''Prince of the Commonwealth''. When told, the Queen continued to express the wish that her husband's position be raised, but rejected the British Cabinet's recommendations of ''Prince Consort'' or ''Prince Royal''. The British Cabinet then suggested simply ''His Royal Highness the Prince'', but the Queen was advised that if she still preferred ''Prince of the Commonwealth'', her Private Secretary could write directly to the Commonwealth [[Governor-General|Governors-General]] for their response, though warning that if their consent was not unanimous the proposal could not go forward.\n\nThe matter appeared left until the publication on 8 February 1957 of an article by P. Wykeham-Bourne in ''The [[Evening Standard]]'' titled: \"Well, is it correct to say Prince Philip?\" A few days following, Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] reversed the advice of the Queen's previous ministers and formally recommended that the Queen reject ''the Prince'' in favour of ''Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Her other Realms and Territories'', only to change this advice, after she consented, to delete even the vague reference to the Commonwealth countries. Letters Patent were issued on 22 February 1957 giving the Duke the style and titular dignity of a Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (omitting the wording ''and Her other Realms and Territories'').

One of the first acts of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s new government was his signing of a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The 'All-Union State TV and Radio Company' ([[Gosteleradio]]) was transformed into the 'Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino'.\n\nA presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a [[closed joint-stock company]], '''Russian Public TV''' (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995).\n\nFollowing the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 financial collapse]], the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled [[banking in Russia|bank]] [[Vneshekonombank]].<ref>''Television in the Russian Federation: Organisational Structure, Program Production and Audience''</ref> Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel's cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2002.\n\nFrom 1 April 1995 until late 2002, the channel was called '''ORT''' (\u041e\u0420\u0422\u2014\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, ''Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye''; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as ''[[Vremya]]'', ''[[KVN]]'', ''[[Chto? Gde? Kogda?]]'', ''[[V mire zhivotnykh]]'' and ''[[Travelers' Club]]''; the last two are no longer on the air of this channel.\n\n==Political coverage==\nIn autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in [[State Duma]] [[1999 Russian legislative election|electoral campaign]] by criticizing Moscow mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and their party [[Fatherland-All Russia]], major opponents of the pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] party [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity]]. [[Sergey Dorenko]], popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of [[business oligarch]] and media magnate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called ''Sergey Dorenko's Program'' on Saturdays at 9&nbsp;pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin's opponents.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec99/russian_elections_12-17.html Russian Elections] (transcript), Jim Lehrer NewsHour, PBS, 17 December 1999.

When Dorenko's show was in turn suspended on 9 September 2000, ORT director-general [[Konstantin Ernst]] insisted that&nbsp;\u2014 contrary to Dorenko's allegations&nbsp;\u2014 the government had not been involved in the change. Ernst stated that he yanked the show because Dorenko had defied his orders to stop discussing the government's plan to nationalize Boris Berezovsky's 49-percent stake in the network.<ref>[http://www.cpj.org/attacks00/europe00/Russia.html Russia 2000 Country Report], CPJ.

Accessed 23 April 2008.</ref> Soon after Berezovsky's withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel's name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One's minority shares are held by three little-known companies, [[ORT-KB]], [[Eberlink2002]], and [[Rastrkom-2002]]. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. The ultimate owner is still believed to be [[Roman Abramovich]], who also controls the [[Video International]] advertising agency, the exclusive media seller of Channel One.\n\nRussian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for the pro-government bias.<ref>For example, see ''Index on Censorship'' Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, issue entitled \"How Free is the Russian Media?\"</ref> The critics charge that Channel One's news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. These critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in [[Chechnya]] or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station's news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning [[Russian government]] policies or goals. For example, during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]s, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian Prime-minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] over that of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that \"the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals. Yushchenko\u2019s style of campaigning is diametrically opposite.\"\n[[File:Vladimir Posner interviews Hillary Rodham Clinton in Moscow 2010.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Posner interviews [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] on the \"Posner Show\" in Moscow, 19 March 2010]]\nIn another controversial example, on a 23 January 2005 broadcast, in the midst of widespread protests against a new reform of Russia's social benefits system (L'goty), a Channel One anchor opined, \"you can understand, and should understand, those who went out on the streets, but you also have to understand that the old system has completely outlived its use.\" Later, in the same story, a reporter characterized those protesting against the reforms as political opportunists, adding, \"criticizing the reform is good PR.\" A few days later, on 27 January 2005, as the protests continued across Russia, a Channel One reporter noted, \"You can understand the elderly [protestors, but] repealing free [bus] fares was the last hope for public transport.\"\n\nSimilarly, on a 12 February 2005 broadcast, a Channel One anchor declared, \"The key question of the week has been: how are Presidents [[Mikheil Saakashvili|[Mikheil] Saakashvili]] [of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>) and Yushchenko [of [[Ukraine]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> different?

One of the first acts of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s new government was his signing of a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The 'All-Union State TV and Radio Company' ([[Gosteleradio]]) was transformed into the 'Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino'.\n\nA presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a [[closed joint-stock company]], '''Russian Public TV''' (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995).\n\nFollowing the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 financial collapse]], the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled [[banking in Russia|bank]] [[Vneshekonombank]].<ref>''Television in the Russian Federation: Organisational Structure, Program Production and Audience''</ref> Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel's cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2002.\n\nFrom 1 April 1995 until late 2002, the channel was called '''ORT''' (\u041e\u0420\u0422\u2014\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, ''Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye''; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as ''[[Vremya]]'', ''[[KVN]]'', ''[[Chto? Gde? Kogda?]]'', ''[[V mire zhivotnykh]]'' and ''[[Travelers' Club]]''; the last two are no longer on the air of this channel.\n\n==Political coverage==\nIn autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in [[State Duma]] [[1999 Russian legislative election|electoral campaign]] by criticizing Moscow mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and their party [[Fatherland-All Russia]], major opponents of the pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] party [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity]]. [[Sergey Dorenko]], popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of [[business oligarch]] and media magnate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called ''Sergey Dorenko's Program'' on Saturdays at 9&nbsp;pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin's opponents.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec99/russian_elections_12-17.html Russian Elections] (transcript), Jim Lehrer NewsHour, PBS, 17 December 1999.

Ernst stated that he yanked the show because Dorenko had defied his orders to stop discussing the government's plan to nationalize Boris Berezovsky's 49-percent stake in the network.<ref>[http://www.cpj.org/attacks00/europe00/Russia.html Russia 2000 Country Report], CPJ.

Accessed 23 April 2008.</ref> Soon after Berezovsky's withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel's name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One's minority shares are held by three little-known companies, [[ORT-KB]], [[Eberlink2002]], and [[Rastrkom-2002]]. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. The ultimate owner is still believed to be [[Roman Abramovich]], who also controls the [[Video International]] advertising agency, the exclusive media seller of Channel One.\n\nRussian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for the pro-government bias.<ref>For example, see ''Index on Censorship'' Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, issue entitled \"How Free is the Russian Media?\"</ref> The critics charge that Channel One's news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. These critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in [[Chechnya]] or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station's news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning [[Russian government]] policies or goals. For example, during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]s, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian Prime-minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] over that of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that \"the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals.

It peaked at #8 for six consecutive weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and spent four weeks at #1 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Tracks]] chart.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits,'' 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 335.</ref>\n\nTo accompany the song on MTV, the band shot its first-ever concept video. It was a difficult experience for a variety of reasons, and the resulting clip has been named as one of the worst videos ever.<ref name=jrnyvid />\n\nThe song was used in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010), the sequel to the 1982 [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Tron]]'' (which had featured the selection \"Only Solutions,\" an earlier release from the team) and also was used in the ''[[Journey (1983 video game)|Journey]]'' arcade game produced by [[Midway Games]]--the same company who manufactured both the ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]'' arcade game and its sequel, ''[[Discs of Tron]].'' This song also appears as the mobile phone ringtone of Carl Allen, the main character in the comedy film ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008). In addition, an instrumental remixed version without vocals was used as the introductory music to NASCAR on CBS broadcasts (except for the Daytona 500) in the mid-1980s.\n\n==Background and writing==\nThe song was written and composed in 1982 during the ''[[Escape (Journey album)|Escape]]'' tour. It is not certain exactly when, or the first time it was performed live.

Written, produced and directed by [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]], the film stars [[David Niven]], [[Roger Livesey]], [[Raymond Massey]], [[Kim Hunter]] and [[Marius Goring]].\n\nThe film was originally released in the United States under the title '''''Stairway to Heaven''''', which derived from the film's most prominent [[special effects|special effect]]: a broad [[escalator]] linking Earth to the [[afterlife]]. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in [[Three-strip Technicolor]], but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as \"Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in [[Technicolor]]\".

He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own [[parachute]] has been shot up. He manages to contact June, an [[Americans|American]] [[Radio|radio operator]] based in England and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.\n\nPeter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the [[Other World]], misses him in the [[Visibility|thick fog]] over the [[English Channel]]. The airman wakes up on a beach near June's base. At first, he assumes he is in the [[afterlife]] but, when a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.\n\nPeter meets June [[cycling]] back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French [[aristocrat]] [[guillotined]] in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a [[Defense (legal)|defence counsel]] from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.\n\nPeter's visions are diagnosed by June's fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury\u2014chronic adhesive [[arachnoiditis]] from a slight [[concussion]] two years earlier\u2014and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves' death allows him to act as Peter's [[counsel]].\n\nReeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife's claim on him. The matter comes to a head\u2014in parallel with Peter's brain surgery\u2014before a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an [[amphitheatre]] to reveal that it is as large as a [[spiral galaxy]]. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.\n\nReeves and Farlan both cite examples from [[British history|British]] and [[world history]] to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter's open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, \"...&nbsp;nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.\"\n\nThe jury rules in Peter's favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it \"very generous\", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[David Niven]] as Squadron Leader Peter David Carter\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as June\n* [[Roger Livesey]] as Dr. Frank Reeves\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as an Angel\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as an English Pilot\n* [[Bonar Colleano]] as an American Pilot\n* [[Joan Maude]] as Chief Recorder\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Conductor 71\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe{{refn|\"Trubshawe\" was a name often given to minor characters in Niven's films at his insistence, as a back-handed tribute to his old army friend [[Michael Trubshawe]].<ref name=warman/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n* [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]] as the Vicar\n* Bob Roberts as Dr. Gaertler\n* Edwin Max as Dr. Mc Ewan\n* Betty Potter as Mrs. Tucker, Reeves' housekeeper\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Abraham Farlan\n* [[Abraham Sofaer]] as the Judge {{col-end}}\n[[File:Matter Life Death Hunter Niven.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim Hunter and David Niven in the film.]]\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n\nGoring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach [[Peter Ustinov]] to play the part.<ref>Powell 1986, p. 489</ref>\n\nPowell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, [[Betty Field]], who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s screen test for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.  Hunter had stage experience and had been under contract to [[David O. Selznick]] for two years.

However, despite being asked several times within the film, no accepted answer to how Peter could have survived the fall is given.\n\nThere are two scenes set within \"the other world\" in which Peter is not present (Trubshawe's arrival and just before the start of the trial) which seem to imply the existence of the other world. A minor point regarding a borrowed book (which forms a third \"other world\" experience while Peter is still unconscious following his operation) also seems to hint at the possibility of its existence; however, these could all be explained simply by Peter's mind filling in blanks during times he is unconscious.\n\n===The other world===\nThe producers took pains never to refer to \"the other world\" as [[Heaven]], as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the \"other world\" and asking: \"It's heaven, isn't it?\" This is followed by the \"other world\" female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be \"...heaven to be a clerk\". An introductory title screen \u2013 repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman<ref name=\"warman\"/> \u2013 contains an explicit statement, however: \"This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war\", but goes on to say \"Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental\".\n\nThe architecture of the other world is noticeably [[modernist]].

There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the [[D-Day]] invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as \"overpaid, oversexed and over here\" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry \u2013 against the British \u2013 is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War.

Written, produced and directed by [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]], the film stars [[David Niven]], [[Roger Livesey]], [[Raymond Massey]], [[Kim Hunter]] and [[Marius Goring]].\n\nThe film was originally released in the United States under the title '''''Stairway to Heaven''''', which derived from the film's most prominent [[special effects|special effect]]: a broad [[escalator]] linking Earth to the [[afterlife]]. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in [[Three-strip Technicolor]], but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as \"Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in [[Technicolor]]\".

He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own [[parachute]] has been shot up. He manages to contact June, an [[Americans|American]] [[Radio|radio operator]] based in England and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.\n\nPeter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the [[Other World]], misses him in the [[Visibility|thick fog]] over the [[English Channel]]. The airman wakes up on a beach near June's base. At first, he assumes he is in the [[afterlife]] but, when a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.\n\nPeter meets June [[cycling]] back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French [[aristocrat]] [[guillotined]] in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a [[Defense (legal)|defence counsel]] from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.\n\nPeter's visions are diagnosed by June's fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury\u2014chronic adhesive [[arachnoiditis]] from a slight [[concussion]] two years earlier\u2014and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves' death allows him to act as Peter's [[counsel]].\n\nReeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife's claim on him. The matter comes to a head\u2014in parallel with Peter's brain surgery\u2014before a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an [[amphitheatre]] to reveal that it is as large as a [[spiral galaxy]]. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.\n\nReeves and Farlan both cite examples from [[British history|British]] and [[world history]] to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter's open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, \"...&nbsp;nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.\"\n\nThe jury rules in Peter's favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it \"very generous\", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[David Niven]] as Squadron Leader Peter David Carter\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as June\n* [[Roger Livesey]] as Dr. Frank Reeves\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as an Angel\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as an English Pilot\n* [[Bonar Colleano]] as an American Pilot\n* [[Joan Maude]] as Chief Recorder\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Conductor 71\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe{{refn|\"Trubshawe\" was a name often given to minor characters in Niven's films at his insistence, as a back-handed tribute to his old army friend [[Michael Trubshawe]].<ref name=warman/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n* [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]] as the Vicar\n* Bob Roberts as Dr. Gaertler\n* Edwin Max as Dr. Mc Ewan\n* Betty Potter as Mrs. Tucker, Reeves' housekeeper\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Abraham Farlan\n* [[Abraham Sofaer]] as the Judge {{col-end}}\n[[File:Matter Life Death Hunter Niven.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim Hunter and David Niven in the film.]]\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n\nGoring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach [[Peter Ustinov]] to play the part.<ref>Powell 1986, p. 489</ref>\n\nPowell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, [[Betty Field]], who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s screen test for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.  Hunter had stage experience and had been under contract to [[David O. Selznick]] for two years.

The American title was the idea of  [[Arthur Krim]] and [[Robert Benjamin]], two lawyers just starting out in the film business, who would be marketing the film in the US, and insisted that no film had ever done well there with the word \"death\" in the title.  When Pressburger countered with the hit film ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]'', their response was to point out that it succeeded because the very fact that Death was on holiday meant that there would be no death in the film.<ref>Powell 1986, pp. 486-87.</ref><ref name=\"SFGate\">Stein, Ruthe.

However, despite being asked several times within the film, no accepted answer to how Peter could have survived the fall is given.\n\nThere are two scenes set within \"the other world\" in which Peter is not present (Trubshawe's arrival and just before the start of the trial) which seem to imply the existence of the other world. A minor point regarding a borrowed book (which forms a third \"other world\" experience while Peter is still unconscious following his operation) also seems to hint at the possibility of its existence; however, these could all be explained simply by Peter's mind filling in blanks during times he is unconscious.\n\n===The other world===\nThe producers took pains never to refer to \"the other world\" as [[Heaven]], as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the \"other world\" and asking: \"It's heaven, isn't it?\" This is followed by the \"other world\" female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be \"...heaven to be a clerk\". An introductory title screen \u2013 repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman<ref name=\"warman\"/> \u2013 contains an explicit statement, however: \"This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war\", but goes on to say \"Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental\".\n\nThe architecture of the other world is noticeably [[modernist]].

There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the [[D-Day]] invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as \"overpaid, oversexed and over here\" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry \u2013 against the British \u2013 is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War.
