Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], a distinction that in Europe dates at least to [[Aristotle]] (300s BCE). Deduction is inference [[Formal proof|deriving]] [[Logical consequence|logical conclusions]] from premises known or assumed to be [[truth|true]],  with the [[Rule of inference|laws of valid inference]] being studied in [[logic]].  Induction is inference from [[particular]] premises to a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] conclusion. A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], distinguishing [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]] from induction.\n\nVarious fields study how inference is done in practice. Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of [[cognitive psychology]]; [[artificial intelligence]] researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. [[Statistical inference]] uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.\n\n==Definition==\nThe process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called [[inductive reasoning]].  The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations.  Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.\n\nThis definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: \"induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances.\" {{clarify|reason=Some information, probably encoded by different type fonts in the dictionary, seems to have got lost. I assume, under the keyword 'induction (logic)', the dictionary says 'the inference of a general law from particular instances'. Please check with the source and clarify.|date=August 2013}}) The definition given thus applies only when the \"conclusion\" is general.\n\nTwo possible definitions of \"inference\" are:\n# A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.\n# The process of reaching such a conclusion.\n\n==Examples==\n===Example for definition #1===\n[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] defined a number of [[syllogism]]s, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:\n# All humans are mortal.\n# All Greeks are humans.\n# All Greeks are mortal.\n\nThe reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?\n\nThe validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word \"valid\" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference.  An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true.  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.\n\nFor example, consider the form of the following [[Symbology|symbological]] track:\n#All meat comes from animals.\n#All beef is meat.\n#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.\n\nNow we turn to an invalid form.\n#All A are B.\n#All C are B.\n#Therefore, all C are A.\n\nTo show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.\n#All apples are fruit. (True)\n#All bananas are fruit. (True)\n#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)\n\nA valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):\n#All tall people are French. (False)\n#John Lennon was tall. (True)\n#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)\n\nWhen a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.\n\nA valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:\n#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)\n#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)\n#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)\n\nIn this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.\n\n===Example for definition #2===\n\nEvidence:  It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the [[Soviet Union]].  You read in the [[Moscow]] newspaper that a [[soccer]] team from a small city in [[Siberia]] starts winning game after game.  The team even defeats the Moscow team.  Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore.  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.\n\nKnowns: The Soviet Union is a [[command economy]]: people and material are told where to go and what to do.  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.\n\nExplanation:  In a [[command economy]], people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good\u2014such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern\u2014that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.\n\n==Incorrect inference==\nAn incorrect inference is known as a [[fallacy]]. Philosophers who study [[informal logic]] have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many [[cognitive bias|biases in human reasoning]] that favor incorrect reasoning.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Inference engines===\n{{main|Reasoning system|Inference engine|expert system|business rule engine}}\n\nAI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of [[expert system]]s and later [[business rule engine]]s.  More recent work on [[automated theorem proving]] has had a stronger\nbasis in formal logic.\n\nAn inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The [[knowledge base]] (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are [[relevance|relevant]] to its task.\n\n====Prolog engine====\n[[Prolog]] (for \"Programming in Logic\") is a [[programming language]] based on a [[subset]] of [[predicate calculus]]. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called [[backward chaining]].\n\nLet us return to our [[Socrates]] [[syllogism]]. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:\n\n mortal(X) :- \tman(X).\n man(socrates). \n( Here ''''':-''''' can be read as \"if\".  Generally, if ''P {{imp}} Q'' (if P then Q)  then in Prolog we would code ''Q''':-'''P'' (Q if P).)<br />\nThis states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:\n\n ?- mortal(socrates).\n(where ''?-'' signifies a query: Can ''mortal(socrates).'' be deduced from the KB using the rules)\ngives the answer \"Yes\".\n\nOn the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:\n\n ?- mortal(plato).\n\ngives the answer \"No\".\n\nThis is because [[Prolog]] does not know anything about [[Plato]], and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called [[closed world assumption]]). Finally\n?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in \"Yes\" (and in some implementations: \"Yes\": X=socrates)<br />\n[[Prolog]] can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.\n\n===Semantic web===\nRecently automatic reasoners found in [[semantic web]] a new field of application. Being based upon [[description logic]], knowledge expressed using one variant of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.\n\n===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===\n{{main|Bayesian inference}}\n\nPhilosophers and scientists who follow the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]] for inference use the mathematical rules of [[probability]] to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features\u2014one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability \"probability logic\", following [[E. T. Jaynes]]).\n\nBayesians identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that \"it's going to rain tomorrow\" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.\n\nThrough the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see [[Bayesian decision theory]]). A central rule of Bayesian inference is [[Bayes' theorem]].\n\n===Fuzzy logic===\n\n{{main||Fuzzy logic}}\n\n{{expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Non-monotonic logic ===\n\n{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}<ref>{{cite book  |first=Andr\u00e9  |last=Fuhrmann  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209221248/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |archivedate= 9 December 2003 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |title=Nonmonotonic Logic |ref=Fuhrmann, Nonmonotonic Logic}}</ref>\n\nA relation of inference is [[monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is [[Nonmonotonic logic|non-monotonic]].\nDeductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.\n\nBy contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.\nWe know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible\u2014that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori]]''\n* [[Abductive reasoning]]\n* [[Deductive reasoning]]\n* [[Inductive reasoning]]\n* [[Entailment]]\n* [[Epilogism]]\n* [[Analogy]]\n* [[Axiom system]]\n** [[Axiom]]\n* [[Immediate inference]]\n* [[Inferential programming]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n* [[Logic]]\n* [[Logic of information]]\n* [[Logical assertion]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Rule of inference]]\n* [[List of rules of inference]]\n* [[Theorem]]\n* [[Transduction (machine learning)]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Ian  |last=Hacking\n  |title=An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic\n  |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n  |year=2011\n\n  |ref=Hacking, 2011\n  |isbn=978-0-521-77501-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Edwin Thompson\n  |last=Jaynes\n  |url=http://titles.cambridge.org/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521592712\n  |title=Probability Theory: The Logic of Science\n  |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n  |year=2003\n  |isbn=978-0-521-59271-0\n  |ref=Jaynes, 2003\n  |access-date=2004-11-29\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011085524/http://titles.cambridge.org/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521592712\n  |archive-date=2004-10-11\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=David J.C.  |last=McKay  |authorlink=David J.

An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true.  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.\n\nFor example, consider the form of the following [[Symbology|symbological]] track:\n#All meat comes from animals.\n#All beef is meat.\n#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.\n\nNow we turn to an invalid form.\n#All A are B.\n#All C are B.\n#Therefore, all C are A.\n\nTo show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.\n#All apples are fruit. (True)\n#All bananas are fruit. (True)\n#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)\n\nA valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):\n#All tall people are French. (False)\n#John Lennon was tall. (True)\n#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)\n\nWhen a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.\n\nA valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:\n#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)\n#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)\n#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)\n\nIn this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.\n\n===Example for definition #2===\n\nEvidence:  It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the [[Soviet Union]].  You read in the [[Moscow]] newspaper that a [[soccer]] team from a small city in [[Siberia]] starts winning game after game.  The team even defeats the Moscow team.  Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore.  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.\n\nKnowns: The Soviet Union is a [[command economy]]: people and material are told where to go and what to do.  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.\n\nExplanation:  In a [[command economy]], people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good\u2014such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern\u2014that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.\n\n==Incorrect inference==\nAn incorrect inference is known as a [[fallacy]]. Philosophers who study [[informal logic]] have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many [[cognitive bias|biases in human reasoning]] that favor incorrect reasoning.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Inference engines===\n{{main|Reasoning system|Inference engine|expert system|business rule engine}}\n\nAI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of [[expert system]]s and later [[business rule engine]]s.  More recent work on [[automated theorem proving]] has had a stronger\nbasis in formal logic.\n\nAn inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The [[knowledge base]] (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are [[relevance|relevant]] to its task.\n\n====Prolog engine====\n[[Prolog]] (for \"Programming in Logic\") is a [[programming language]] based on a [[subset]] of [[predicate calculus]]. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called [[backward chaining]].\n\nLet us return to our [[Socrates]] [[syllogism]]. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:\n\n mortal(X) :- \tman(X).\n man(socrates). \n( Here ''''':-''''' can be read as \"if\".  Generally, if ''P {{imp}} Q'' (if P then Q)  then in Prolog we would code ''Q''':-'''P'' (Q if P).)<br />\nThis states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:\n\n ?- mortal(socrates).\n(where ''?-'' signifies a query: Can ''mortal(socrates).'' be deduced from the KB using the rules)\ngives the answer \"Yes\".\n\nOn the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:\n\n ?- mortal(plato).\n\ngives the answer \"No\".\n\nThis is because [[Prolog]] does not know anything about [[Plato]], and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called [[closed world assumption]]). Finally\n?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in \"Yes\" (and in some implementations: \"Yes\": X=socrates)<br />\n[[Prolog]] can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.\n\n===Semantic web===\nRecently automatic reasoners found in [[semantic web]] a new field of application. Being based upon [[description logic]], knowledge expressed using one variant of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.\n\n===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===\n{{main|Bayesian inference}}\n\nPhilosophers and scientists who follow the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]] for inference use the mathematical rules of [[probability]] to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features\u2014one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability \"probability logic\", following [[E. T. Jaynes]]).\n\nBayesians identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that \"it's going to rain tomorrow\" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.\n\nThrough the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see [[Bayesian decision theory]]). A central rule of Bayesian inference is [[Bayes' theorem]].\n\n===Fuzzy logic===\n\n{{main||Fuzzy logic}}\n\n{{expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Non-monotonic logic ===\n\n{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}<ref>{{cite book  |first=Andr\u00e9  |last=Fuhrmann  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209221248/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |archivedate= 9 December 2003 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |title=Nonmonotonic Logic |ref=Fuhrmann, Nonmonotonic Logic}}</ref>\n\nA relation of inference is [[monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is [[Nonmonotonic logic|non-monotonic]].\nDeductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.\n\nBy contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.\nWe know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible\u2014that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori]]''\n* [[Abductive reasoning]]\n* [[Deductive reasoning]]\n* [[Inductive reasoning]]\n* [[Entailment]]\n* [[Epilogism]]\n* [[Analogy]]\n* [[Axiom system]]\n** [[Axiom]]\n* [[Immediate inference]]\n* [[Inferential programming]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n* [[Logic]]\n* [[Logic of information]]\n* [[Logical assertion]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Rule of inference]]\n* [[List of rules of inference]]\n* [[Theorem]]\n* [[Transduction (machine learning)]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Ian  |last=Hacking\n  |title=An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic\n  |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n  |year=2011\n\n  |ref=Hacking, 2011\n  |isbn=978-0-521-77501-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Edwin Thompson\n  |last=Jaynes\n  |url=http://titles.cambridge.org/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521592712\n  |title=Probability Theory: The Logic of Science\n  |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n  |year=2003\n  |isbn=978-0-521-59271-0\n  |ref=Jaynes, 2003\n  |access-date=2004-11-29\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011085524/http://titles.cambridge.org/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521592712\n  |archive-date=2004-10-11\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=David J.C.  |last=McKay  |authorlink=David J.

One blue passion flower or hybrid even grew to large size at [[Malm\u00f6 Central Station]] in [[Sweden]].<ref>Petersen (1966)</ref>\n\nPassion flowers have been a subject of studies investigating [[extranuclear inheritance]]; [[paternal]] inheritance of [[chloroplast]] DNA has been documented in this genus.<ref>E.g. Hansen ''et al.'' (2006)</ref> The [[plastome]] of the [[two-flowered passion flower]] (''P. biflora'') has been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]].\n\nThe French name for this plant has lent itself to ''La Famille Passiflore'', a highly successful children's book series by [[Genevi\u00e8ve Huriet]], and an animated series based upon it.

A small pink fruit that wrinkles easily and a larger shiny yellow to orange fruit are traded under this name. The latter is usually considered just a [[variety (biology)|variety]] ''flavicarpa'', but seems to be more distinct in fact.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* [[Sweet granadilla]] (''P. ligularis'') is another widely grown species. In large parts of [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] it is the plant called \"passionfruit\": confusingly, in [[South Africa]]n English the latter species is more often called \"granadilla\" (without an adjective). Its fruit is somewhat intermediate between the two sold as ''P. edulis''.\n* [[Maypop]] (''P. incarnata''), a common species in the southeastern US. This is a subtropical representative of this mostly tropical family. However, unlike the more tropical cousins, this particular species is hardy enough to withstand the cold down to {{convert|-20|C|F}} before its roots die (it is native as far north as [[Pennsylvania]] and has been cultivated as far north as [[Boston]] and [[Chicago]].) The fruit is sweet, yellowish, and roughly the size of a chicken's egg; it enjoys some popularity as a native plant with edible fruit and few [[pest (organism)|pests]].\n* [[Giant granadilla]] (giant tumbo or ''badea'', ''P. quadrangularis''), [[water lemon]] (''P. laurifolia'') and [[sweet calabash]] (''P. maliformis'') are ''Passiflora'' species locally famed for their fruit, but not widely known elsewhere yet.\n* [[Wild maracuja]] are the fruit of ''P. foetida'', which are popular in [[Southeast Asia]].\n* [[Banana passionfruit]]s are the very elongated fruits of [[Passiflora tripartita|''P. tripartita'' var.

The latter is usually considered just a [[variety (biology)|variety]] ''flavicarpa'', but seems to be more distinct in fact.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* [[Sweet granadilla]] (''P. ligularis'') is another widely grown species. In large parts of [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] it is the plant called \"passionfruit\": confusingly, in [[South Africa]]n English the latter species is more often called \"granadilla\" (without an adjective). Its fruit is somewhat intermediate between the two sold as ''P. edulis''.\n* [[Maypop]] (''P. incarnata''), a common species in the southeastern US. This is a subtropical representative of this mostly tropical family. However, unlike the more tropical cousins, this particular species is hardy enough to withstand the cold down to {{convert|-20|C|F}} before its roots die (it is native as far north as [[Pennsylvania]] and has been cultivated as far north as [[Boston]] and [[Chicago]].)

{"title_page": "Software patent", "text_new": "{{short description|Patent that covers a computer program}}\n{{Computer programs, software and patent law}}\n{{Patent law}}\n\nA '''software patent''' is a [[patent]] on a piece of [[software]], such as a [[computer program]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[user interface]], or [[algorithm]].\n\n==Background==\nA patent is a set of exclusionary rights granted by a [[State (polity)|state]] to a patent holder for a limited period of time, usually 20 years. These rights are granted to patent applicants in exchange for their disclosure of the inventions. Once a patent is granted in a given country, no person may make, use, sell or import/export the claimed invention in that country without the permission of the patent holder. Permission, where granted, is typically in the form of a [[license]] which conditions are set by the patent owner: it may be free or in return for a royalty payment or lump sum fee.\n\nPatents are territorial in nature. To obtain a patent, inventors must file [[patent application]]s in each and every country in which they want a patent. For example, separate applications must be filed in [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[United States]] and [[India]] if the applicant wishes to obtain patents in those countries. However, some regional offices exist, such as the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), which act as supranational bodies with the power to grant patents which can then be brought into effect in the member states, and an international procedure also exists for filing a single international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), which can then give rise to patent protection in most countries.\n\nThese different countries and regional offices have different standards for granting patents. This is particularly true of software or computer-implemented inventions, especially where the software is implementing a business method.\n\n==Early example of a software patent==\nOn 21 May 1962, a British patent application entitled \"''A Computer Arranged for the Automatic Solution of [[linear programming|Linear Programming]] Problems''\" was filed.<ref name=\"BP-patent\">{{cite patent|GB|1039141}}</ref> The invention was concerned with [[Out-of-core algorithm|efficient memory management]] for the [[simplex algorithm]], and could be implemented by purely software means. The patent was granted on August 17, 1966 and seems to be one of the first software patents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=K|year=2000|title=Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention|location=London|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|page=4}}<br/>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2003_1/kretschmer/|title=Software as Text and Machine: The Legal Capture of Digital Innovation|first=Martin|last=Kretschmer|journal=Journal of Information Law & Technology (JILT)|place=Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management, Bournemouth University|date=4 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdictions==\nMost countries place some limits on the patenting of inventions involving software, but there is no one legal definition of a software patent. For example, U.S. patent law excludes \"abstract ideas\", and this has been used to refuse some patents involving software. In Europe, \"computer programs as such\" are excluded from patentability, thus [[European Patent Office]] policy is consequently that a program for a computer is not patentable if it does not have the potential to cause a \"technical effect\" which is by now understood as a material effect (a \"transformation of nature\").<ref>{{cite book|title=Technique et droit des brevets.

The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method  and system for assessing an individual\u2019s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|177|2015|litigants=Commissioner of Patents v RPL Central Pty Ltd |date=11 December 2015 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nIn principle, computer software is still a valid patentable subject matter in Australia. But, in circumstances where patents have been sought over software to merely implement abstract ideas or business methods, the courts and the Commissioner of Patents have resisted granting patent protection to such applications both as a matter of statutory interpretation and policy.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Software patents under Canadian patent law}}\nIn [[Canada]], courts have held that the use of a computer alone neither lends, nor reduces patentability of an invention. However, it is the position of the Canadian Patent Office that where a computer is an \"essential element\" of a patent's claims, the claimed invention is generally patentable subject matter.<ref>{{citation|title=Examination Practice Respecting Computer-Implemented Inventions \u2013 PN 2013-03|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr03627.html|publisher=Canadian Intellectual Property Office|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\nIn China, the starting time of software patent is relatively late. Because before 2006, software patents were basically not granted, and software and hardware had to be combined with applying for a patent. With the development of network technology and software technology, China's patent examination system has been constantly updated. Recently, the design idea of the software itself has been allowed to apply for patent separately, instead of requiring to be combined with hardware. However, software patent writing requirements are relatively high.\n\nSoftware patents can be written as either a product or a method, depending on the standards of review. However, no matter what form it is written in, it is difficult to highlight the creativity of the scheme, which requires specific case analysis.\n\nSoftware that can be patented mainly includes (but is not limited to) :\n\n(1) industrial control software, such as controlling the movement of mechanical equipment;\n\n(2) software to improve the internal performance of the computer, such as a software can improve the virtual memory of the computer;\n\n(3) external technical data processing software, such as digital camera image processing software.\n\nIt is fair to say that a considerable proportion of software belongs to category (3).\n\nThe patent protection measures can be seen in the patent law and the regulations on the protection of computer software.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nWithin European Union member states, the EPO and other national patent offices have issued many patents for inventions involving software since the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. {{EPC Article|52}} excludes \"programs for computers\" from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\" (Art. 52(3)).

Dr. Tangkitvanich, the IT specialist of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised his concern that Thailand is not in a good stage for a software patent as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for the infant software companies.<ref>Newsbytes, Thailand Mulls Software Patent Rules, at http: //www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/ (last visited Jul. 25, 2000).</ref> Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. \u201cMonopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open-source software\u201d, said by a group of Thai Economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, \u00a0provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: \u201cThailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers' creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand\u201d. As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Software patents2.JPG|thumb|left|Growth of software patents in US]]\n{{Main|Software patents under United States patent law}}\nThe [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] has granted patents that may be referred to as software patents since at least the early 1970s.<ref>{{US patent|3552738}}, {{US patent|3553358}} and {{US patent|3553384}} granted 5 January 1971, and {{US patent|3996564}} granted December 7, 1976 can be easily found using the [[Bessen/Hunt technique]].

Diehr, {{ussc|450|175|1981}}</ref>\n\nDue to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in 1982 the U.S. Congress created a new court (the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]) to hear patent cases. Following several landmark decisions by this court, by the early 1990s the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines stating that \"A ''practical application'' of a computer-related invention is statutory subject matter. This requirement can be discerned from the variously phrased prohibitions against the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature or natural phenomena\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons093.htm|title=Examination Guidelines for Computer-Related Inventions|publisher=United States Patent Office|date=1996-03-26|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nThe recent expansion of the [[Internet]] and [[e-commerce]] has led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software and the question of whether [[business method patent|business methods]] are statutory subject matter is a separate issue from the question of whether software is.

Furthermore, it can be executed in the medium of a new process or product or a developmental enhancement in a product or process. According to Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 7 of Patent Law in Indonesia.,<ref name=\":1\" /> an application can not be patented as an invention if the product or process contradicts or challenges the current regulations and rules, public order or ethics, and religious morality.

However, one way for the Indonesian Intellectual Property office to grant software patents in Indonesia is if the application has been patented in other nations, which have ratified the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|Patent Corporation Treaty]] (PCT). Therefore, in accordance to the regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, a software will have a regional protection among the participating entities of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.co.id/uploads/4/0/0/2/40023645/pct_regulations.pdf|title=Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAn important update was enacted on 26 August 2016, the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia.<ref name=\":0\" /> This update is geared to encourage innovation and growth by augmenting the number of patents within the public and private sector in Indonesia. This update proposes an extension of protection for simple patent, which grants application for patents for new improvements or inventions to existing processes. Intangible inventions can also be patented; under the former law, simple patent is restricted for tangible inventions, which has a positive implication for software patents in Indonesia. Furthermore, these changes provide more protection to the pharmaceutical industry and encourage public access to medical knowledge. This can boost new software ideas and processes within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. This update provides a stronger protection of traditional knowledge. In addition, a significant update is the usability of electronic filling and electronic media. Under this new law, application can be made electronically.\n\n==Purpose of patents==\n{{Main|Patentable subject matter}}\nFor the U.S., the purpose of patents is laid down in the constitutional clause that gives Congress the power \"[t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;\" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). For Europe, there is no similar definition. Commonly four patent justification theories are recognised, as laid down for instance by Machlup in 1958,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/etexts/patentsystem.pdf|title=An Economic Review of the Patent System (1958)|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> which include justice to the inventor and benefit for society by rewarding inventors. Disclosure is required in return for the exclusive right, and disclosure may promote further development. However, the value of disclosure should not be overestimated: some inventions could not be kept secret otherwise, and patents also prohibit independent reinventions to be exploited.\n\nThere is [[Software patent debate|debate]] as to whether or not these aims are achieved with software patents.\n\n==Proposals==\nIn seeking to find a balance, different countries have different policies as to where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie. In Europe, a number of different proposals for setting a boundary line were put forward during the debate concerning the proposed [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], none of which were found acceptable by the various parties to the debate. Two particular suggestions for a hurdle that software must pass to be patentable include:\n\n* A computer program that utilises \"controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results\".<ref>{{citation|title=Amendment 23 to the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|date=September 2003|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210231145/http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|archivedate=February 10, 2006}}<br/>{{citation|title=Dispositions program decision|publisher=[[Bundesgerichtshof]] (, BGH, Federal Court of Justice of Germany)|date=1976-06-22}}</ref>\n* A computer program which provides a \"technical effect\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t930059eu1.htm|work=Decision T 0059/93 () of 20 April 1994|date=20 April 1994|publisher=[[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal]]|title=Reasons, point 3.4}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, [[Ben Klemens]], a Guest Scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]], proposed that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=25 March 2006|page=A9|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114325217495908172|title=The Gravity of the U.S. Patent Swindle}}</ref> This is based on Justice [[William Rehnquist]]'s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of [[Diamond v.

Europe uses an 'Inventive step test'; see the [[Inventive step under the European Patent Convention|Inventive step requirement in Europe]] and, for instance, [[T 258/03]].\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Compatibility===\nThere are a number of high-profile examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) patent problems, and [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] to avoid [[MP3]]. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money and creates inconvenience to users.\n\n===Computer-implemented invention (CII)===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nUnder the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), and in particular its Article 52,<ref>{{EPC Article|52}}</ref> \"[[computer programs|programs for computers]]\" are not regarded as inventions for the purpose of granting European patents,<ref>{{EPC Article|52|1}}</ref> but this exclusion from patentability only applies to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such.<ref>{{EPC Article|52|3}}</ref> As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much stricter scrutiny<ref name=LaubThesis>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|first=Christoph|last=Laub|title=International Software Patent Filing: The Problem of Statutory Subject Matter in view of Legal Standards at the EPO-USPTO and Economic Implications|year=2005|origyear=Academic Year 2004/2005|type=Master's|publisher=Munich Intellectual Property Law Center |accessdate=21 March 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621083254/http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2007}}</ref> when compared to their [[USPTO|American counterpart]], that does not mean that all [[invention]]s including some [[software]] are ''[[de jure]]'' not [[patentability|patentable]].\n\n===Overlap with copyright===\n{{See also|Software copyright|Copyright infringement of software}}\nPatent and copyright protection constitute two different means of legal protection which may cover the same subject matter, such as computer programs, since each of these two means of protection serves its own purpose.<ref>{{citation|work=Decision [[T 1173/97]] (Computer program product/IBM) of 1.7.1998|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=1 July 1998|title=Reasons 2.4|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t971173ex1.htm}}</ref> Software is protected as works of literature under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]].

As of 2015, approximately 500,000 patents had issued in the 23 classes of patents covering \"computer implemented inventions\" (see table).\n\nMany software companies [[cross-licensing|cross license]] their patents to each other. These agreements allow each party to practice the other party's patented inventions without the threat of being sued for [[patent infringement]]. [[Microsoft]], for example, has agreements with [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] (now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Siemens]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Autodesk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arn.idg.com.au/index.php?taxid=620938001&id=63439861 |title=Microsoft, Autodesk in patent licensing deal |work=IDG News Service |date=2004-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222332/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/5043/microsoft_autodesk_patent_licensing_deal/?taxid=620938001 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> and recently [[Novell]]. Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.\n\nThe ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing [[Open-source software|open source]] software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, [[Red Hat]] had developed a [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of 10 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 163 pending US patent applications, and 33 pending international PCT ([[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies so that they can preserve their freedom to operate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOther patent holders are in the business of inventing new \"computer implemented inventions\" and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. [[Walker Digital]], for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the [[Priceline.com]] reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.autm.net/FY_2004_Licensing_Survey/8932.htm|title=FY 2004 U.S. Licensing Survey|publisher=Association of University Technology Managers|date=2012-09-08}}</ref>\n\nStill other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as [[Intellectual Ventures]], are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, [[Intel]], [[Google]], etc. Others, such as [[Acacia Research|Acacia Technologies]], are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders.<ref>{{citation|url=http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/overview.xhtml?ID=fffrfkrhrrxhjcxxkh|title=Acacia Technologies LLC: Company Information|publisher=Hoovers}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of acquiring patents merely to license them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as [[patent troll]]s. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g. $100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 or more) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.{{Citation needed|reason=What are median license fees and litigation costs?

'''software patent''' is a [[patent]] on a piece of [[software]], such as a [[computer program]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[user interface]], or [[algorithm]].\n\n==Background==\nA patent is a set of exclusionary rights granted by a [[State (polity)|state]] to a patent holder for a limited period of time, usually 20 years. These rights are granted to patent applicants in exchange for their disclosure of the inventions. Once a patent is granted in a given country, no person may make, use, sell or import/export the claimed invention in that country without the permission of the patent holder. Permission, where granted, is typically in the form of a [[license]] which conditions are set by the patent owner: it may be free or in return for a royalty payment or lump sum fee.\n\nPatents are territorial in nature. To obtain a patent, inventors must file [[patent application]]s in each and every country in which they want a patent. For example, separate applications must be filed in [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[United States]] and [[India]] if the applicant wishes to obtain patents in those countries. However, some regional offices exist, such as the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), which act as supranational bodies with the power to grant patents which can then be brought into effect in the member states, and an international procedure also exists for filing a single international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), which can then give rise to patent protection in most countries.\n\nThese different countries and regional offices have different standards for granting patents. This is particularly true of software or computer-implemented inventions, especially where the software is implementing a business method.\n\n==Early example of a software patent==\nOn 21 May 1962, a British patent application entitled \"''A Computer Arranged for the Automatic Solution of [[linear programming|Linear Programming]] Problems''\" was filed.<ref name=\"BP-patent\">{{cite patent|GB|1039141}}</ref> The invention was concerned with [[Out-of-core algorithm|efficient memory management]] for the [[simplex algorithm]], and could be implemented by purely software means. The patent was granted on August 17, 1966 and seems to be one of the first software patents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=K|year=2000|title=Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention|location=London|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|page=4}}<br/>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2003_1/kretschmer/|title=Software as Text and Machine: The Legal Capture of Digital Innovation|first=Martin|last=Kretschmer|journal=Journal of Information Law & Technology (JILT)|place=Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management, Bournemouth University|date=4 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdictions==\nMost countries place some limits on the patenting of inventions involving software, but there is no one legal definition of a software patent. For example, U.S. patent law excludes \"abstract ideas\", and this has been used to refuse some patents involving software. In Europe, \"computer programs as such\" are excluded from patentability, thus [[European Patent Office]] policy is consequently that a program for a computer is not patentable if it does not have the potential to cause a \"technical effect\" which is by now understood as a material effect (a \"transformation of nature\").<ref>{{cite book|title=Technique et droit des brevets.

The subject matter of an invention is patentable in Australia, if it is a ''manner of manufacture'' within the meaning of section 6 of the [[Statute of Monopolies]].<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|/pa1990109|Patents Act 1990|18}} Patentable inventions</ref> The High Court of Australia has refrained from ruling on the precise definition of manner of manufacture stating that any such attempt is bound to fail for the policy reason of encouraging national development in fields that may be unpredictable.<ref name=\"102 CLR 252\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|67|1959|litigants=National Research Development Corp v Commissioner of Patents |parallelcite=(1959) 102 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 252 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In assessing whether an invention is a manner of manufacture, the High Court has relied on the inquiry of whether  the subject of the claims defining the invention has as its end result an ''artificially created state of affairs''.<ref name=\"102 CLR 252\"/>\n\nIn a decision of the Federal Court of Australia, on the patentability of an improved method of representing curved images in computer graphics displays, it was held that the application of selected mathematical methods to computers may involve steps which are foreign to the normal use of computers and hence amount to a manner of manufacture.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|811|1991|parallelcite=105 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 388 |litigants=International Business Machines Corp v Commissioner of Patents |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In another unanimous decision by the Full Federal Court of Australia, an invention for methods of storing and retrieving Chinese characters to perform word processing was held to be an artificially created state of affairs and consequently within the concept of a manner of manufacture.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|396|1994|parallelcite=(1994) 51 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 260 |litigants=CCOM Pty Ltd v Jie-jing Pty Ltd |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] |juris=Australia}}.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, in a recent decision on the patentability of a computer implemented method of generating an index based on selection and weighing of data based on certain criterion, the Full Federal Court of Australia reaffirmed that mere methods, schemes and plans are not manners of manufacture.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\">{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|150|2014|litigants=Research Affiliates LLC v Commissioner of Patents |date=10 November 2014 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> The Full Court went on to hold that the use of a computer to implement a scheme did not contribute to the invention or the artificial effect of the invention.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\"/> The subject matter of the invention was held to be an abstract idea and not a manner of manufacture within the meaning of the term in the Patents Act. The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method  and system for assessing an individual\u2019s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|177|2015|litigants=Commissioner of Patents v RPL Central Pty Ltd |date=11 December 2015 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nIn principle, computer software is still a valid patentable subject matter in Australia. But, in circumstances where patents have been sought over software to merely implement abstract ideas or business methods, the courts and the Commissioner of Patents have resisted granting patent protection to such applications both as a matter of statutory interpretation and policy.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Software patents under Canadian patent law}}\nIn [[Canada]], courts have held that the use of a computer alone neither lends, nor reduces patentability of an invention. However, it is the position of the Canadian Patent Office that where a computer is an \"essential element\" of a patent's claims, the claimed invention is generally patentable subject matter.<ref>{{citation|title=Examination Practice Respecting Computer-Implemented Inventions \u2013 PN 2013-03|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr03627.html|publisher=Canadian Intellectual Property Office|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== '''China''' ===\nIn China, the starting time of software patent is relatively late. Because before 2006, software patents were basically not granted, and software and hardware had to be combined with applying for a patent. With the development of network technology and software technology, China's patent examination system has been constantly updated. Recently, the design idea of the software itself has been allowed to apply for patent separately, instead of requiring to be combined with hardware. However, software patent writing requirements are relatively high.\n\nSoftware patents can be written as either a product or a method, depending on the standards of review. However, no matter what form it is written in, it is difficult to highlight the creativity of the scheme, which requires specific case analysis.\n\nSoftware that can be patented mainly includes (but is not limited to) :\n\n(1) industrial control software, such as controlling the movement of mechanical equipment;\n\n(2) software to improve the internal performance of the computer, such as a software can improve the virtual memory of the computer;\n\n(3) external technical data processing software, such as digital camera image processing software.\n\nIt is fair to say that a considerable proportion of software belongs to category (3).\n\nThe patent protection measures can be seen in the patent law and the regulations on the protection of computer software.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nWithin European Union member states, the EPO and other national patent offices have issued many patents for inventions involving software since the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. {{EPC Article|52}} excludes \"programs for computers\" from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\" (Art. 52(3)). This has been interpreted to mean that any invention that makes a non-obvious \"technical contribution\" or solves a \"technical problem\" in a non-obvious way is patentable even if that technical problem is solved by running a computer program.<ref name=\"t0469/03\">{{citation|title=DECISION of 24 February 2006, Case Number: T 0469/03 \u2013 3.5.01|pages=Reasons 5.1 to 5.3|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=24 February 2006|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t030469eu1.html}}</ref>\n\nComputer-implemented inventions that ''only'' solve a business problem using a computer, rather than a technical problem, are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step (see [[T 258/03]]). Nevertheless, the fact that an invention is useful in business does not mean it is not patentable if it also solves a technical problem.\n\nA summary of the developments concerning patentability of computer programs under the European Patent Convention is given in (see [[G 3/08]]) as a response of the Enlarged Board of Appeal to questions filed by the President of the European Patent Office according to Art. 112(1)b) EPC.\n\nConcerns have been raised that the new (2015) [[Unified Patent Court]] will be much more open to patents generally and software patents in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://endsoftpatents.org/pages/unitary-patent/|title=End Software Patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/europes-unitary-patent.en.html|title=Europe's \"unitary patent\" could mean unlimited software patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://en.swpat.org/wiki/EU_unitary_patent_and_Unified_Patent_Court|title=EU unitary patent and Unified Patent Court}}</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn April 2013, the [[German Parliament]] adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2013/04/22/german-parliament-sends-message-stop-granting-software-patents|title=German Parliament Sends Message: Stop Granting Software Patents|last1=Ermert|first1=Monika|date=22 April 2013|work=Intellectual Property Watch|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{Main|Software patents under United Kingdom patent law}}\nUnited Kingdom patent law is interpreted to have the same effect as the [[European Patent Convention]] such that \"programs for computers\" are excluded from patentability to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\". Current case law in the UK states that an (alleged) invention will only be regarded as an invention if it provides a contribution that is not excluded and that is also technical. A computer program implementing a business process is therefore not an invention, but a computer program implementing an industrial process may well be.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], a clause to include software patents was quashed by the [[Indian Parliament]] in April 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/software-patents-under-ordinance-face-reversal/82155|title=Software patents under Ordinance face reversal|publisher=Financialexpress.com|date=2005-03-29|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> However, following publication of the new guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions on 19 February 2016, the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade marks accepts applications for software patents, as long as the software is claimed in conjunction with a novel hardware.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/34244396/Software_Patents_and_the_Internet_of_Things_in_Europe_the_United_States_and_India_FULL_TEXT_|title=Software Patents and the Internet of Things in Europe, the United States and India (FULL TEXT)|first=PhD|last=Guido Noto La Diega|via=www.academia.edu}}</ref> On 30 June 2017, revised guidelines on the examination of computer related inventions were published. This 2017 guidelines provides clarity on patentability of software invention in India, ie., the claimed computer-related invention needs to be ascertained whether it is of a technical nature involving technical advancement as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and is not subject to exclusion under Section 3 of the Patents Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/Revised__Guidelines_for_Examination_of_Computer-related_Inventions_CRI__.pdf|title=Guidelines for Examination of Computer Related Inventions (CRIs)}}</ref>.\nIn 2019, the Court observed,\n\u201cIn today\u2019s digital world, when most inventions are based on computer programs, it would be retrograde to argue that all such inventions would not be patentable. Innovation in the field of artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies and other digital products would be based on computer programs, however the same would not become nonpatentable inventions \u2013 simply for that reason. It is rare to see a product which is not based on a computer program. Whether they are cars and other automobiles, microwave ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, they all have some sort of computer programs in-built in them. Thus, the effect that such programs produce including in digital and electronic products is crucial in determining the test of patentability.\u201d \nPatent applications in these fields would have to be examined to see if they result in a \u201ctechnical contribution\u201d, it added.\nFurther elaborating on the usage of the term \u2018per se\u2019 in Section 3(k), the Court said,\n\u201cThe words \u2018per se\u2019 were incorporated so as to ensure that genuine inventions which are developed, based on computer programs are not refused patents.\u201d <ref>{{cite news |last1=Aditi |first1=Singh |title=A computer program which makes 'technical contribution' patentable, not hit by Sec 3(k) of Patents Act |url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/a-computer-program-which-makes-technical-contribution-patentable-not-hit-by-sec-3k-of-patents-act |accessdate=13 February 2020 |agency=Bar and Bench |date=29 December 2019}}</ref>.\n\n===Japan===\nSoftware-related inventions are patentable.

Subsequently, the JPO experienced a surge in business method patent filings. This surge was met with a dramatic decrease in the average grant rate of business method patents during the following six years; it lingered around 8 percent between 2003 and 2006 (8 percent is extremely low in comparison to the average of 50 percent across all technical fields). Since 2006, the average grant rate for business method patents has risen to the current rate of roughly 25 percent.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.worldipreview.com/article/an-important-market-software-patenting-in-japan|title=An important market: software patenting in Japan|publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Review]]|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn [[New Zealand]] computer programs are to be excluded from patentability under a 2010 Patents Bill, but guidelines permitting embedded software are to be drafted once the bill has passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+announces+way+forward+software+patents|title=Minister announces way forward for software patents|publisher=beehive.govt.nz|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920044258/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+announces+way+forward+software+patents|archivedate=2010-09-20}}<br/>{{cite news|title=New Zealand says no to software patents|date=16 July 2010|first=Sam|last=Varghese|newspaper=Government Tech Policy|url=http://www.itwire.com/it-policy-news/govenrment-tech-policy/40451-new-zealand-says-no-to-software-patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/4617/south_pacific_cousins_part_way|title=South Pacific cousins part ways over patents|publisher=Cpaglobal.com|date=2010-07-28|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826000324/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/4617/south_pacific_cousins_part_way|archivedate=2012-08-26}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/50667-new-zealand-bans-software-patents|title=New Zealand bans software patents|publisher=TG Daily|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2012-10-09}}<br/>{{cite web|author=Fairfax Media Business Group|url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/nzict-says-patents-integral-to-software-protection|title=NZICT says patents 'integral' to software protection &#124; Computerworld New Zealand|publisher=Computerworld.co.nz|date=2010-04-15|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115221652/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/nzict-says-patents-integral-to-software-protection|archivedate=2013-01-15}}</ref> From 2013 computer programs 'as such' are excluded from patentability.

''ProQuest.'' Web. 11 Apr. 2020.</ref>. The opinions are divided into two sides. Dr. Tangkitvanich, the IT specialist of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised his concern that Thailand is not in a good stage for a software patent as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for the infant software companies<ref>Newsbytes, Thailand Mulls Software Patent Rules, at http: //www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/ (last visited Jul. 25, 2000).</ref>. Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. \u201cMonopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open-source software\u201d, said by a group of Thai Economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, \u00a0provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: \u201cThailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers' creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand\u201d. As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections. \n\n===United States===\n[[File:Software patents2.JPG|thumb|left|Growth of software patents in US]]\n{{Main|Software patents under United States patent law}}\nThe [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] has granted patents that may be referred to as software patents since at least the early 1970s.<ref>{{US patent|3552738}}, {{US patent|3553358}} and {{US patent|3553384}} granted 5 January 1971, and {{US patent|3996564}} granted December 7, 1976 can be easily found using the [[Bessen/Hunt technique]].

We do not so hold.\"<ref>Gottschalk v Benson, {{ussc|409|63|1972}}</ref> In 1981, the Supreme Court stated that \"a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer\" and a [[Claim (patent)|claim]] is patentable if it contains \"a mathematical formula [and] implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect\".<ref>Diamond v. Diehr, {{ussc|450|175|1981}}</ref>\n\nDue to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in 1982 the U.S. Congress created a new court (the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]) to hear patent cases. Following several landmark decisions by this court, by the early 1990s the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines stating that \"A ''practical application'' of a computer-related invention is statutory subject matter. This requirement can be discerned from the variously phrased prohibitions against the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature or natural phenomena\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons093.htm|title=Examination Guidelines for Computer-Related Inventions|publisher=United States Patent Office|date=1996-03-26|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nThe recent expansion of the [[Internet]] and [[e-commerce]] has led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software and the question of whether [[business method patent|business methods]] are statutory subject matter is a separate issue from the question of whether software is.  Critics of the Federal Circuit believe that the non-obviousness standard is partly responsible for the large increase in patents for software and business methods.<ref>Bessen, James, and Michael J. Meurer. Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008</ref> There have been several successful enforcement trials in the United States, some of which are listed in the [[list of software patents]] article.\n\nAn issue with software patent intellectual property rights is typically revolved around deciding whether the company or inventor owns it.\n\nAs a matter of law, in the United States, the employee generally owns the IP right unless the employee\u2019s inventing skills or task to create the invention is the main specific hiring reason or a specific clause in the employment agreement assigning invention rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/|title=Home|last=Employment|first=Small Business and Training|date=2010-12-03|website=www.business.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adlilaw.com/who-owns-the-rights-to-a-patent-the-employer-or-inventor/|title=Who owns the rights to a patent?

To begin evaluation, it is necessary to distinguish whether or not the application is considered an invention. Under Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 1 of Patent Law in Indonesia<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/id/id044en.pdf|title=Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 14 Year 2001|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, application is considered as an invention if the activity is created to solve a particular conflict or problem in the technology sector. Furthermore, it can be executed in the medium of a new process or product or a developmental enhancement in a product or process. According to Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 7 of Patent Law in Indonesia.<ref name=\":1\" />, an application can not be patented as an invention if the product or process contradicts or challenges the current regulations and rules, public order or ethics, and religious morality. In addition, if the application is treated as a method or theory in the scientific or mathematics, argued to be any type of living creatures, with the exception of micro-organisms, or is considered as an essential biological measure to produce plants or animals, the application is not a patentable invention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs software contains algorithms, it is deemed to be part of the field of mathematics; hence, software cannot be protected by patents in Indonesia. However, one way for the Indonesian Intellectual Property office to grant software patents in Indonesia is if the application has been patented in other nations, which have ratified the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|Patent Corporation Treaty]] (PCT). Therefore, in accordance to the regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, a software will have a regional protection among the participating entities of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.co.id/uploads/4/0/0/2/40023645/pct_regulations.pdf|title=Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAn important update was enacted on 26 August 2016, the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia.<ref name=\":0\" /> This update is geared to encourage innovation and growth by augmenting the number of patents within the public and private sector in Indonesia. This update proposes an extension of protection for simple patent, which grants application for patents for new improvements or inventions to existing processes. Intangible inventions can also be patented; under the former law, simple patent is restricted for tangible inventions, which has a positive implication for software patents in Indonesia. Furthermore, these changes provide more protection to the pharmaceutical industry and encourage public access to medical knowledge. This can boost new software ideas and processes within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. This update provides a stronger protection of traditional knowledge. In addition, a significant update is the usability of electronic filling and electronic media. Under this new law, application can be made electronically.<br />\n==Purpose of patents==\n{{Main|Patentable subject matter}}\nFor the U.S., the purpose of patents is laid down in the constitutional clause that gives Congress the power \"[t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;\" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). For Europe, there is no similar definition. Commonly four patent justification theories are recognised, as laid down for instance by Machlup in 1958,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/etexts/patentsystem.pdf|title=An Economic Review of the Patent System (1958)|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> which include justice to the inventor and benefit for society by rewarding inventors. Disclosure is required in return for the exclusive right, and disclosure may promote further development. However, the value of disclosure should not be overestimated: some inventions could not be kept secret otherwise, and patents also prohibit independent reinventions to be exploited.\n\nThere is [[Software patent debate|debate]] as to whether or not these aims are achieved with software patents.\n\n==Proposals==\nIn seeking to find a balance, different countries have different policies as to where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie. In Europe, a number of different proposals for setting a boundary line were put forward during the debate concerning the proposed [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], none of which were found acceptable by the various parties to the debate. Two particular suggestions for a hurdle that software must pass to be patentable include:\n\n* A computer program that utilises \"controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results\".<ref>{{citation|title=Amendment 23 to the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|date=September 2003|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210231145/http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|archivedate=February 10, 2006}}<br/>{{citation|title=Dispositions program decision|publisher=[[Bundesgerichtshof]] (, BGH, Federal Court of Justice of Germany)|date=1976-06-22}}</ref>\n* A computer program which provides a \"technical effect\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t930059eu1.htm|work=Decision T 0059/93 () of 20 April 1994|date=20 April 1994|publisher=[[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal]]|title=Reasons, point 3.4}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, [[Ben Klemens]], a Guest Scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]], proposed that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=25 March 2006|page=A9|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114325217495908172|title=The Gravity of the U.S. Patent Swindle}}</ref> This is based on Justice [[William Rehnquist]]'s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of [[Diamond v.

Upholding an \"insignificant postsolution activity\" rule as per Justice [[Rehnquist]]'s ruling would also eliminate most [[business method patent]]s.\n\n==Obviousness==\nA common objection to software patents is that they relate to trivial inventions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/20/comment.comment|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Patent absurdity|date=June 20, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010|first=Richard|last=Stallman}}</ref> A patent on an invention that many people would easily develop independently of one another should not, it is argued, be granted since this impedes development.\n\nDifferent countries have different ways of dealing with the question of [[inventive step and non-obviousness]] in relation to software patents. Europe uses an 'Inventive step test'; see the [[Inventive step under the European Patent Convention|Inventive step requirement in Europe]] and, for instance, [[T 258/03]].\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Compatibility===\nThere are a number of high-profile examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) patent problems, and [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] to avoid [[MP3]]. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money and creates inconvenience to users.\n\n===Computer-implemented invention (CII)===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nUnder the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), and in particular its Article 52,<ref>{{EPC Article|52}}</ref> \"[[computer programs|programs for computers]]\" are not regarded as inventions for the purpose of granting European patents,<ref>{{EPC Article|52|1}}</ref> but this exclusion from patentability only applies to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such.<ref>{{EPC Article|52|3}}</ref> As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much stricter scrutiny<ref name=LaubThesis>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|first=Christoph|last=Laub|title=International Software Patent Filing: The Problem of Statutory Subject Matter in view of Legal Standards at the EPO-USPTO and Economic Implications|year=2005|origyear=Academic Year 2004/2005|type=Master's|publisher=Munich Intellectual Property Law Center |accessdate=21 March 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621083254/http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2007}}</ref> when compared to their [[USPTO|American counterpart]], that does not mean that all [[invention]]s including some [[software]] are ''[[de jure]]'' not [[patentability|patentable]].\n\n===Overlap with copyright===\n{{See also|Software copyright|Copyright infringement of software}}\nPatent and copyright protection constitute two different means of legal protection which may cover the same subject matter, such as computer programs, since each of these two means of protection serves its own purpose.<ref>{{citation|work=Decision [[T 1173/97]] (Computer program product/IBM) of 1.7.1998|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=1 July 1998|title=Reasons 2.4|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t971173ex1.htm}}</ref> Software is protected as works of literature under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. This allows the creator to prevent another entity from copying the program and there is generally no need to register code in order for it to be copyrighted.\n\nPatents, on the other hand, give their owners the right to prevent others from using the technology defined by the patent claims, even if the technology was independently developed and there was no copying of a software or software code involved. In fact, one of the most recent EPO decisions<ref>{{citation|title=Decision T 0424/03 (Clipboard formats I/MICROSOFT) of 23.2.2006|publisher=European Patent Office Boards of Appeal|date=23 February 2006|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t030424eu1.htm}}</ref> clarifies the distinction, stating that software is patentable, because it is basically only a technical method executed on a computer, which is to be distinguished from the program itself for executing the method, the program being merely an expression of the method, and thus being copyrighted.\n\nPatents cover the underlying methodologies embodied in a given piece of software, or the function that the software is intended to serve, independent of the particular language or code that the software is written in. Copyright prevents the direct copying of some or all of a particular version of a given piece of software, but does not prevent other authors from writing their own embodiments of the underlying methodologies. Assuming a dataset meets certain criteria, copyright can also be used to prevent a given set of data from being copied while still allowing the author to keep the contents of said set of data a [[trade secret]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/733688/Trade+Secrets/Copyright+in+Data+Compilations+Is+Thin|title=Copyright in Data Compilations is Thin|last=Bro|first=Sarah|date=September 6, 2018|work=Mondaq Business Briefing|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhether and how the [[Numerus clausus#Law|numerus clausus principle]] shall apply to the legal hybrid software<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Copyrightable functions and patentable speech|journal=Communications of the ACM|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|volume=44|issue=2|date=February 2001|pages=69\u201375|doi=10.1145/359205.359231}}</ref> to provide a judicious balance between property rights of the title holders and freedom rights of computing professionals<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiesewetter-K\u00f6binger|first=Swen|year=2010|title=Programmers' Capital|journal=Computer|volume=43|issue=2|pages=106\u2013108|doi=10.1109/MC.2010.47}}</ref> and society as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/patent_policy/en/scp_14/scp_14_7.pdf|title=Proposal from Brazil in respect of exceptions and limitations to patent rights|author=Standing Committee on the Law of Patents|date=January 20, 2010|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref> is in dispute.<ref>{{citation|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/comp/replies/planck_en.pdf|title=Stellungnahme zum Sondierungspapier der Kommission der Europaischen Gemeinschaften: Die Patentierbarkeit Computer-implementierter Erfindungen|trans-title=Opinion on the consultation paper by the Commission of the European Communities: The patentability of computer-implemented inventions|author=Max-Planck-Institut|date=20 December 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.buchhandel.de/WebApi1/GetMmo.asp?MmoId=4804929&mmoType=PDF|first=Marcus|last=Hoffmann|title=Mehrfachschutz geistigen Eigentums im deutschen Rechtssystem|trans-title=Multiple protection of intellectual property in the German legal system|year=2008|isbn=978-3-8316-0806-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Peukert|title=G\u00fcterzuordnung als Rechtsprinzip|trans-title=Goods classification as a legal principle|year=2008|isbn=978-3-16-149724-7|publisher=Mohr Siebeck}}</ref>\n\n===Debate===\n\nThere is a [[software patent debate|debate]] over the extent to which software patents should be granted, if at all.

As of 2015, approximately 500,000 patents had issued in the 23 classes of patents covering \"computer implemented inventions\" (see table).\n\nMany software companies [[cross-licensing|cross license]] their patents to each other. These agreements allow each party to practice the other party's patented inventions without the threat of being sued for [[patent infringement]]. [[Microsoft]], for example, has agreements with [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] (now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Siemens]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Autodesk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arn.idg.com.au/index.php?taxid=620938001&id=63439861 |title=Microsoft, Autodesk in patent licensing deal |work=IDG News Service |date=2004-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222332/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/5043/microsoft_autodesk_patent_licensing_deal/?taxid=620938001 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> and recently [[Novell]]. Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.\n\nThe ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing [[Open-source software|open source]] software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, [[Red Hat]] had developed a [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of 10 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 163 pending US patent applications, and 33 pending international PCT ([[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies so that they can preserve their freedom to operate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOther patent holders are in the business of inventing new \"computer implemented inventions\" and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. [[Walker Digital]], for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the [[Priceline.com]] reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.autm.net/FY_2004_Licensing_Survey/8932.htm|title=FY 2004 U.S. Licensing Survey|publisher=Association of University Technology Managers|date=2012-09-08}}</ref>\n\nStill other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as [[Intellectual Ventures]], are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, [[Intel]], [[Google]], etc. Others, such as [[Acacia Research|Acacia Technologies]], are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders.<ref>{{citation|url=http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/overview.xhtml?ID=fffrfkrhrrxhjcxxkh|title=Acacia Technologies LLC: Company Information|publisher=Hoovers}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of acquiring patents merely to license them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as [[patent troll]]s. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g. $100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 or more) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.{{Citation needed|reason=What are median license fees and litigation costs?

The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support. In general, mode selection is based on [[Respiratory therapist|clinician]] familiarity and institutional preferences, since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome.  The most frequently used forms of volume-limited mechanical ventilation are intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, Cide D, Goldwaser R, Soto L, Bugedo G, Rodrigo C, Pimentel J, Raimondi G, Tobin MJ |title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.\n#A breath is assisted if the ventilator does work on the patient. An assisted breath is one for which the ventilator does some portion of the work of breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for V<sub>T</sub> x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIf the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).

With HFPV it utilizes an open circuit to deliver its subtidal volumes by way of the patient interface known as the Phasitron.\n\n=== Volume guarantee ===\nVolume guarantee an additional parameter available in many types of ventilators that allows the ventilator to change its inspiratory pressure setting to achieve a minimum tidal volume.

PEEP is applied using either a valve that is connected to the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a mechanical ventilator.\n\nPEEP is a pressure that an exhalation has to bypass, in effect causing [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to remain open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and an increase in PEEP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"D. P. Schuster, M.

With support from the ventilator, the patient also regulates their own [[respiratory rate]] and their [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]].\n\nIn Pressure Support, the set inspiratory pressure support level is kept constant and there is a decelerating flow. The patient triggers all breaths. If there is a change in the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected.

Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for V<sub>T</sub> x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIf the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).

This is seen in High-Frequency Jet Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFJV. Also categorized under High Frequency Ventilation  is High Frequency Percussive Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFPV. With HFPV it utilizes an open circuit to deliver its subtidal volumes by way of the patient interface known as the Phasitron.\n\n=== Volume guarantee ===\nVolume guarantee an additional parameter available in many types of ventilators that allows the ventilator to change its inspiratory pressure setting to achieve a minimum tidal volume.  This is utilized most often in neonatal patients who need a pressure controlled mode with a consideration for volume control to minimize [[volutrauma]].\n\n== Spontaneous breathing and support settings ==\n\n=== Positive end-expiratory pressure ===\n[[Positive end expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is pressure applied upon expiration.  PEEP is applied using either a valve that is connected to the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a mechanical ventilator.\n\nPEEP is a pressure that an exhalation has to bypass, in effect causing [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to remain open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and an increase in PEEP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"D. P. Schuster, M.

It is a form of servo targeting.\n\nThe goal of ATC is to support the resistive work of breathing through the artificial airway\n\n====Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist====\nNeurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is adjusted by a computer (servo) and is similar to ATC but with more complex requirements for implementation.\n\nIn terms of patient-ventilator synchrony, NAVA supports both resistive and elastic work of breathing in proportion to the patient's inspiratory effort\n\n====Proportional Assist Ventilation====\nProportional assist ventilation (PAV) is another servo targeting based mode in which the ventilator guarantees the percentage of work regardless of changes in [[pulmonary compliance]] and resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Younes M |title=Proportional assist ventilation, a new approach to ventilatory support.

The amount it delivers is proportional to the percentage of assistance it is set to give.\n\nPAV, like NAVA, supports both restrictive and elastic work of breathing in proportion to the patient's inspiratory effort.\n\n=== Liquid ventilation ===\n[[Liquid ventilation]] is a technique of mechanical ventilation in which the lungs are insufflated with an oxygenated perfluorochemical liquid rather than an oxygen-containing gas mixture. The use of perfluorochemicals, rather than nitrogen, as the inert carrier of oxygen and carbon dioxide offers a number of theoretical advantages for the treatment of acute lung injury, including:\n*Reducing surface tension by maintaining a fluid interface with alveoli\n*Opening of collapsed alveoli by hydraulic pressure with a lower risk of barotrauma\n*Providing a reservoir in which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged with pulmonary capillary blood\n*Functioning as a high-efficiency heat exchanger\nDespite its theoretical advantages, efficacy studies have been disappointing and the optimal clinical use of LV has yet to be defined.<ref name=\"pmid8647601\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Degraeuwe PL, Vos GD, Blanco CE | title=Perfluorochemical liquid ventilation: from the animal laboratory to the intensive care unit. | journal=Int J Artif Organs | year= 1995 | volume= 18 | issue= 10 | pages= 674\u201383 | pmid=8647601 | doi= 10.1177/039139889501801020 }}</ref>\n\n==== Total liquid ventilation ====\nIn total liquid ventilation (TLV), the entire lung is filled with an oxygenated PFC liquid, and a liquid tidal volume of PFC is actively pumped into and out of the lungs. A specialized apparatus is required to deliver and remove the relatively dense, viscous PFC tidal volumes, and to extracorporeally oxygenate and remove carbon dioxide from the liquid.<ref name=\"pmid7780839\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Norris MK, Fuhrman BP, Leach CL | title=Liquid ventilation: it's not science fiction anymore. | journal=AACN Clin Issues Crit Care Nurs | year= 1994 | volume= 5 | issue= 3 | pages= 246\u201354 | pmid=7780839 | doi= 10.4037/15597768-1994-3004 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid8732549\">{{cite journal| author=Greenspan JS| title=Physiology and clinical role of liquid ventilation therapy. | journal=J Perinatol | year= 1996 | volume= 16 | issue= 2 Pt 2 Su | pages= S47-52 | pmid=8732549 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid8852261\">{{cite journal| author=Dirkes S| title=Liquid ventilation: new frontiers in the treatment of ARDS. | journal=Crit Care Nurse | year= 1996 | volume= 16 | issue= 3 | pages= 53\u20138 | pmid=8852261 | doi= 10.4037/ccn1996.16.3.53 }}</ref>\n\n==== Partial liquid ventilation ====\nIn partial liquid ventilation (PLV), the lungs are slowly filled with a volume of PFC equivalent or close to the FRC during gas ventilation.
