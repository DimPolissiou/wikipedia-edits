The [[Indo-Guyanese]] labour leader [[Cheddi Jagan]] became Leader of the PPP and Burnham became its chairman.<ref>[http://www.ppp-civic.org/history/historyppp.htm History of the PPP], PPP website.</ref> In 1952, Burnham became the president of the party's affiliated trade union, the British Guiana Labour Union. In 1953, the PPP won 18 of 24 seats in the first election by Universal Adult Suffrage/Franchise permitted by the British colonial government.

Jagan supported a socialist path,<ref>The Guyana story, from prehistory to independence</ref><ref>Cheddi Jagan's 'the West on trial</ref> but Burnham believed that, given the geopolitical conditions of the era, communism would be a better alternative (unbeknownst to the British and USA - who mistakenly believed him to be a proponent of moderatism). Neither the USA nor Britain wanted a communist government controlling the small South American country. The powers, therefore, supported Burnham, through misguided naivet\u00e9 (unaware of his communist leanings), leading to a disastrous economic situation in Guyana - the effects of which can still be felt today. In effect, much of Burnham\u2019s leadership saw Guyana obtain massive debts, experience stagflation, suffer a massive rise in crime, and was generally characterized by the PNC\u2019s rigging of elections (until the 1992 election overseen by former USA president Jimmy Carter). The British and USA would later formally apologize for this destabilization, albeit years later in the 2000s.<ref>http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter133.html (see also: Forbidden Freedom by Cheddi Jagan)</ref> As a result of foreign support, Burnham went on to form the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] in 1958 entering its first election under that name in 1961.\n\n== Leader of Guyana: The People's National Congress (PNC)==\n[[File:Presidential Standard of Guyana (1980-1985) under President LFS Burnham.png|right|thumb|207x207px|Forbes Burnham Presidential Standard]]\n\nIn the [[1964 British Guiana general election|1964 election]] Jagan's PPP won the highest percentage of the vote (46% to the PNC's 41%), but it did not win a majority. Burnham succeeded in forming a coalition with the United Force (TUF) (which had won the remaining 12% of the votes) and became premier of British Guiana on 14 December. On 26 May 1966, British Guiana became an independent country and was renamed \"Guyana\".\n\nDue to the (at the time) radical views of Cheddi Jagan (who leaned towards communism \u2013 both due to his socialist economic views, and his alliances with the Soviet Union and Cuba), Burnham was propped up by both the American and British Governments to assure the propagation of US/British control within the region<ref>Jagan, C. 1994. Forgotten Freedom. Hansib Publications Limited. Guyana. 3rd edition.</ref> At first, Burhnam pursued moderate policies, but in one of his first acts upon independence, he had passed a sweeping \"National Security Act\" giving the police the power to search, seize and arrest anyone virtually at will. (citation needed) \n\nHe won full power in 1968, although many{{quantify|date=October 2014}} condemned the elections as fraudulent because of a large number of irregularities (such as questionable numbers of overseas voters on the rolls).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1970, he veered sharply to the left and established strong relations with [[Cuba]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[North Korea]] and other communist countries. (citation needed) On 23 February of that year, he declared Guyana a \"co-operative republic\". (citation needed) Adopting a policy of [[autarky]], he banned all forms of imports into the country, including flour and varieties of rice that had been integral to the diet of ethnic Indian citizens. Burnham also nationalised the major industries that were foreign-owned and -controlled, reducing the private sector's share of the economy to 10 percent by 1979. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham, after attending the 1970 summit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], paid official visits to several African countries\u2014Zambia, [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Ethiopia]]\u2014over the period 12\u201330 September 1970. (citation needed) The Guyanese government remained fully involved in the African liberation movement throughout the 1970s.<ref name=Granger/> Interestingly, although Guyana provided much-needed aid to African nations in their time of need - when Guyana was in its most dire times of need (the early 1990s and late 2010s), none of these African nations offered aid to Guyana. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham sent more than a hundred Guyanese public servants to various departments of the Zambian Government. Many Guyanese doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries worked in Southern African states throughout the 1970s.<ref name=Granger/> Current census data indicates that the majority of doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries currently working in Guyana originate from India, Sri Lanka, Cuba and China. (citation needed) \n\nIn 1974 Burnham declared the PNC to be paramount and socialist.) citation needed) He won a [[1978 Guyanese constitutional referendum|1978 referendum]] which made it much easier for the government to change the constitution. Anecdotal evidence from hundreds of Indo-Guyanese (and Afro-Guyanese who were PPP supporters) claims that PNC enforcers aggressively (and often violently) denied PPP supporters of the opportunity to vote. (citation needed) Most notably, official figures showed the referendum passing with an implausible 97 percent of the vote. (citation needed) In 1980 the constitution was changed to make the presidency an [[Executive president|executive post]]. Burnham won election as president that year. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham introduced [[mass games]] to Guyana. They were first held in February 1980 to commemorate the founding of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.<ref>https://apjjf.org/2015/13/4/Moe-Taylor/4258.html</ref>\n\nBurnham remained President of Guyana until his death. He died on 6 August 1985 after undergoing throat surgery in [[Georgetown Hospital (Guyana)|Georgetown Hospital]].<ref name=GINA/>\n\nBurnham remained President of Guyana through the process of rigging elections, and squirreling ballot boxes at the Army headquarters, after which they were destroyed, without the votes being counted. (citation needed) According to Dr. Walter Rodney, Burnham's \"style of rule has many similarities with that of the late Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza\" - who not only oppressed the working class, but those in the upper echelons of the society who refused to go along with his domination. (citation needed) Walter Rodney was later assassinated, many believe because he stridently opposed Forbes Burnham and the PNC, who had a hand in his demise.

The British and USA would later formally apologize for this destabilization, albeit years later in the 2000s.<ref>http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter133.html (see also: Forbidden Freedom by Cheddi Jagan)</ref> As a result of foreign support, Burnham went on to form the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] in 1958 entering its first election under that name in 1961.\n\n== Leader of Guyana: The People's National Congress (PNC)==\n[[File:Presidential Standard of Guyana (1980-1985) under President LFS Burnham.png|right|thumb|207x207px|Forbes Burnham Presidential Standard]]\n\nIn the [[1964 British Guiana general election|1964 election]] Jagan's PPP won the highest percentage of the vote (46% to the PNC's 41%), but it did not win a majority. Burnham succeeded in forming a coalition with the United Force (TUF) (which had won the remaining 12% of the votes) and became premier of British Guiana on 14 December.  On 26 May 1966, British Guiana became an independent country and was renamed \"Guyana\".\n\nDue to the (at the time) radical views of Cheddi Jagan (who leaned towards communism \u2013 both due to his socialist economic views, and his alliances with the Soviet Union and Cuba), Burnham was propped up by both the American and British Governments to assure the propagation of US/British control within the region<ref>Jagan, C. 1994. Forgotten Freedom.  Hansib Publications Limited. Guyana. 3rd edition.</ref> At first, Burhnam pursued moderate policies, but in one of his first acts upon independence, he had passed a sweeping \"National Security Act\" giving the police the power to search, seize and arrest anyone virtually at will. (citation needed) \n\nHe won full power in 1968, although many{{quantify|date=October 2014}} condemned the elections as fraudulent because of a large number of irregularities (such as questionable numbers of overseas voters on the rolls).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  In 1970, he veered sharply to the left and established strong relations with [[Cuba]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[North Korea]] and other communist countries. (citation needed) On 23 February of that year, he declared Guyana a \"co-operative republic\".  (citation needed) Adopting a policy of [[autarky]], he banned all forms of imports into the country, including flour and varieties of rice that had been integral to the diet of ethnic Indian citizens. Burnham also nationalised the major industries that were foreign-owned and -controlled, reducing the private sector's share of the economy to 10 percent by 1979. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham, after attending the 1970 summit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], paid official visits to several African countries\u2014Zambia, [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Ethiopia]]\u2014over the period 12\u201330 September 1970. (citation needed) The Guyanese government remained fully involved in the African liberation movement throughout the 1970s.<ref name=Granger/> Interestingly, although Guyana provided much-needed aid to African nations in their time of need - when Guyana was in its most dire times of need (the early 1990s and late 2010s), none of these African nations offered aid to Guyana. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham sent more than a hundred Guyanese public servants to various departments of the Zambian Government. Many Guyanese doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries worked in Southern African states throughout the 1970s.<ref name=Granger/> Current census data indicates that the majority of doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries currently working in Guyana originate from India, Sri Lanka, Cuba and China. (citation needed) \n\nIn 1974 Burnham declared the PNC to be paramount and socialist.) citation needed) He won a [[1978 Guyanese constitutional referendum|1978 referendum]] which made it much easier for the government to change the constitution. Anecdotal evidence from hundreds of Indo-Guyanese (and Afro-Guyanese who were PPP supporters) claims that PNC enforcers aggressively (and often violently) denied PPP supporters of the opportunity to vote. (citation needed) Most notably, official figures showed the referendum passing with an implausible 97 percent of the vote. (citation needed) In 1980 the constitution was changed to make the presidency an [[Executive president|executive post]]. Burnham won election as president that year. (citation needed) \n\nBurnham introduced [[mass games]] to Guyana. They were first held in February 1980 to commemorate the founding of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.<ref>https://apjjf.org/2015/13/4/Moe-Taylor/4258.html</ref>\n\nBurnham remained President of Guyana until his death. He died on 6 August 1985 after undergoing throat surgery in [[Georgetown Hospital (Guyana)|Georgetown Hospital]].<ref name=GINA/>\n\nBurnham remained President of Guyana through the process of rigging elections, and squirreling ballot boxes at the Army headquarters, after which they were destroyed, without the votes being counted. (citation needed) According to Dr. Walter Rodney, Burnham's \"style of rule has many similarities with that of the late Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza\" - who not only oppressed the working class, but those in the upper echelons of the society who refused to go along with his domination. (citation needed) Walter Rodney was later assassinated, many believe because he stridently opposed Forbes Burnham and the PNC, who had a hand in his demise.

Having attended Mount Saint Joseph College in Roscrea, he entered [[University College Dublin]], where he obtained a BE civil engineering degree and BSc degree. He subsequently went on to get a master's degree in UCD before marrying Elizabeth Ann (Lilian) Mulleaney and emigrating to England, where he secured a job with leading construction steelmaker [[Dorman Long]].\n\nIn 1947 he secured a post as senior lecturer in [[Leeds University]], where he obtained a PhD in 1951. \nThen in 1953, he was invited to take up the newly created head of engineering post at the fledgling [[Indian Institute of Technology]] in Kharagpur, Eastern India. His teaching philosophy was always to encourage a 'practical' hands-on approach to engineering, and to this end, he encouraged his students to embark on a project to design and build a swimming pool complex on the institute's campus.\n\nFinally in 1956, he moved to the [[University of Hong Kong]] to take up the post of Taikoo Professor of Engineering. \nWithin a few years he had expanded the engineering faculty from one department to four, and later went on to be appointed dean of the joint Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. \nOutside of academia, he was a founding council member of the Hong Kong Management Association in 1960.\n \nDuring his time in the University of Hong Kong, he initiated an intensive research programme studying the effects of wind on tall buildings, attracting global interest and culminating in an International Seminar in 1961.[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/professor-sean-mackey-1.112027][https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc4fPWocyykC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=sean+mackey+hong+kong&source=bl&ots=HvmicR-qIY&sig=oWcN60ma_nfoNvvXmUHThia9-pY&hl=en&ei=frqgS8CaIoWUjAeOmbj4DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=sean%20mackey%20hong%20kong&f=false][http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27577329?selectedversion=NBD2550686] 1968 saw him help set up and become, the first president of the Hong Kong branch of the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]. \nIn 1962 he was elected president of the Hong Kong St Patrick's Society [http://www.stpatrickshk.com/history/] and was also for many years, a Steward of the prestigious [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. He also founded and chaired the Colony's 'British Engineering Week' in 1966, which was opened by the late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]. In recognition of this work, the British Government awarded Professor Mackey the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]- honorary, because he was the holder of an Irish passport.\n\nAcademically, he went on to receive fellowships of both the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]]. In 1965, Mackey achieved a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from his alma mater, [[University College Dublin]] (National University of Ireland) and in 1972, received a second DSc (Honorary) from the University of Hong Kong.<ref>http://www3.hku.hk/hongrads/index.php/archive/graduate?congregation_id=20&class_of_doctor_id=all</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace by the Colony's Legislative Council, and subsequently chaired a number of committees, including one specifically set up to investigate corruption within the Hong Kong Police Force. In 1978 as a result of his untiring voluntary work with the international [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] foundation, he was honoured by the Vatican with a Knighthood of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]].\n\nAfter nineteen years service, he retired from The University of Hong Kong in 1976, [http://www3.hku.hk/hongrads/index.php/chi/archive/graduate_detail/202] and went on to practise successfully as an independent Consulting Engineer for a further eight years, working on major projects such as the new [[Kwai Tsing Container Terminals]] and new airport [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on Chek Lap Kok Island.\n\nIn 1984 Sean Mackey fully retired and returned with his wife Lilian to his beloved Ireland, to be with his three sons and seven grandchildren, and to concentrate on his other great love \u2013 fishing. Even in retirement, he still found time to attend several meetings of the Irish Institute of Engineers.\nMackey died aged 79, in June 1997.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackey, Sean}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Geological Society of London]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the physician|Sean Mackey (physician)}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=April 2018}}\n\n'''Sean Mackey''', OBE, KGS (1918\u20131997) was an Irish engineer.\n\n==Biography==\nSean Mackey was born in [[Dolla, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]], in 1917.

His teaching philosophy was always to encourage a 'practical' hands-on approach to engineering, and to this end, he encouraged his students to embark on a project to design and build a swimming pool complex on the institute's campus.\n\nFinally in 1956, he moved to the [[University of Hong Kong]] to take up the post of Taikoo Professor of Engineering. \nWithin a few years he had expanded the engineering faculty from one department to four, and later went on to be appointed dean of the joint Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. \nOutside of academia, he was a founding council member of the Hong Kong Management Association in 1960.\n \nDuring his time in the University of Hong Kong, he initiated an intensive research programme studying the effects of wind on tall buildings, attracting global interest and culminating in an International Seminar in 1961.[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/professor-sean-mackey-1.112027][https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc4fPWocyykC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=sean+mackey+hong+kong&source=bl&ots=HvmicR-qIY&sig=oWcN60ma_nfoNvvXmUHThia9-pY&hl=en&ei=frqgS8CaIoWUjAeOmbj4DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=sean%20mackey%20hong%20kong&f=false][http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27577329?selectedversion=NBD2550686] 1968 saw him help set up and become, the first president of the Hong Kong branch of the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]. \nIn 1962 he was elected president of the Hong Kong St Patrick's Society [http://www.stpatrickshk.com/history/] and was also for many years, a Steward of the prestigious [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. He also founded and chaired the Colony's 'British Engineering Week' in 1966, which was opened by the late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]. In recognition of this work, the British Government awarded Professor Mackey the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]- honorary, because he was the holder of an Irish passport.\n\nAcademically, he went on to receive fellowships of both the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]]. In 1965, Mackey achieved a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from his alma mater, [[University College Dublin]] (National University of Ireland) and in 1972, received a second DSc (Honorary) from the University of Hong Kong.<ref>http://www3.hku.hk/hongrads/index.php/archive/graduate?congregation_id=20&class_of_doctor_id=all</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace by the Colony's Legislative Council, and subsequently chaired a number of committees, including one specifically set up to investigate corruption within the Hong Kong Police Force. In 1978 as a result of his untiring voluntary work with the international [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] foundation, he was honoured by the Vatican with a Knighthood of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]].\n\nAfter nineteen years service, he retired from The University of Hong Kong in 1976, [http://www3.hku.hk/hongrads/index.php/chi/archive/graduate_detail/202] and went on to practise successfully as an independent Consulting Engineer for a further eight years, working on major projects such as the new [[Kwai Tsing Container Terminals]] and new airport [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on Chek Lap Kok Island.\n\nIn 1984 Sean Mackey fully retired and returned with his wife Lilian to his beloved Ireland, to be with his three sons and seven grandchildren, and to concentrate on his other great love \u2013 fishing. Even in retirement, he still found time to attend several meetings of the Irish Institute of Engineers.\nMackey died aged 79, in June 1997.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackey, Sean}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Geological Society of London]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Mac the life", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Mackey"}

He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.\n\nIn his ''Memoirs''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&dq=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pp=204\u201307 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I.

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope.

Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 \u2013 20 July 1903) was head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>\n\n===Papal conclave, 1878===\n{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}\nPope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.\n\nIn the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church\u2013state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;\u2013 On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]\n\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>\n\nLeo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope.
