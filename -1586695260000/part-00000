Bazilian''' (born July 21, 1953), is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, arranger and producer, best known for being a founding member of the rock band [[The Hooters]] and for writing \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]],\" made famous by [[Joan Osborne]] in 1995.\n\n==Early life==\nEric Michael Bazilian was born at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Hospital in [[Philadelphia]] to a father who was a [[psychiatrist]] and a mother who was a concert pianist. He is Jewish.\n\nHe began playing the piano at age five, and his uncle taught him guitar at nine. He never took formal musical lessons. At the age of 10, while watching [[The Beatles]] on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], Bazilian realized that playing and creating music was what he wished to pursue with his life.\n\nAt 16 years old, while attending [[Germantown Friends School]], Bazilian started writing songs for his first band, Evil Seed. This band played all original music at \"Be-ins\" at Belmont Plateau in [[Fairmount Park]].\n\nBy the mid 1970s, while attending the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [[Physics]], Bazilian met [[Rob Hyman]] and [[Rick Chertoff]], with whom he formed a band called Baby Grand. They would release two albums during their tenure.\n\n==Tenure with The Hooters==\nAfter Baby Grand disbanded, Hyman and Bazilian decided to try something new by combining [[reggae]], [[ska]], and [[rock'n'roll]] to create [[The Hooters]] in 1980.\n\n''[[Nervous Night (album)|Nervous Night]]'', [[The Hooters]]' 1985 debut on [[Columbia Records]], sold more than 2 million copies and included ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top 40 hits \"Day By Day\" (#18), \"[[And We Danced (The Hooters song)|And We Danced]]\" (#21) and \"Where Do The Children Go\" (#38).\n\nAfter releasing six albums, [[The Hooters]] obtained a large global following throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, they were asked to open three major musical events of the late 20th century: [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1985, [[Amnesty International]] Concert at [[Giants Stadium]] in 1986, and [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin]] in 1990.  In 1995, The Hooters went on hiatus, although Hyman and Bazilian would continue to collaborate on musical projects for other artists.\n\nBazilian reunited with The Hooters on successful headlining European summer tours in 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n\n2007 saw the release of ''[[Time Stand Still]]'', their first album of new material since 1993.\n\nIn 2009, they released \"[[Both Sides Live]]\", a double CD which featured a concert at Philadelphia's Electric Factory as well as a special acoustic performance recorded at [[Rob Hyman]]'s Elm Street Studios.\n\nIn 2010, to celebrate 30 years as a band, they released a five song EP entitled \"[[Five By Five]]\", produced by [[Nick Jameson]]. The EP featured the only \"official\" studio recordings by the band of Rob Hyman's \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and Bazilian's \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]\".\n\nThe Hooters continue to tour successfully in Germany and Scandinavia and perform special concert events in their native [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==\"One of Us\"==\nBazilian has become recognized internationally for being a songwriter, [[session musician]], arranger, and producer for many artists.\n\nIn 1995, he played all those roles for [[Joan Osborne]]'s major-label debut album ''[[Relish (album)|Relish]],'' which was nominated for six [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the No. 4 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]],\" which Bazilian wrote.\n\n\"One of Us\" has since been covered by many artists throughout the world, among them being [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Doctor Evil]] in ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', [[Martyn Joseph]], Scott Bradoka, Sharla Jackson Band, Wildside, Jackie \"O\", [[DJ Irene]], [[Outta Control]], and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]].\n\nIn 2003, \"One of Us\" was used as the [[theme song]] for the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. It has also appeared on the soundtracks of numerous movies, including ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001), ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'', (2003) and ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (film)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'' (2005).\n\nIn more recent years, [[The Hooters]] have also performed \"One of Us\" in their live shows.\n\n==Recognitions==\nOn November 17, 2000, Bazilian was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame on the [[Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia|Avenue of the Arts]].<ref>[http://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk_names.htm#b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727173419/http://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk_names.htm |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2004, Bazilian won an [[ASCAP]] Film and Television Music Award for \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]\" as the [[theme song]] for the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo career===\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''The Optimist'' (2000)\n| title1          = Driving in England\n| length1         = 4:19\n| title2          = Until You Dare\n| length2         = 4:17\n| title3          = Gemini Yo Yo\n| length3         = 4:32\n| title4          = Bye Bye Baby\n| length4         = 5:24\n| title5          = U.G.L.Y.\n| length5         = 3:45\n| title6          = When I Was the Man\n| length6         = 3:54\n| title7          = Kid from Outer Space\n| length7         = 5:03\n| title8          = By My Woman\n| length8         = 4:46\n| title9          = Fiddlesticks\n| length9         = 4:03\n| title10         = Hopelessly, Relentlessly\n| length10        = 5:11\n| title11         = Mind Going Down\n| length11        = 3:27\n| title12         = The Optimist / One of Us (Demo) [hidden track]\n| length12        = 9:30\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''A Very Dull Boy'' (2002)\n| title1          = A Very Dull Boy\n| length1         = 5:03\n| title2          = Lucky to Be\n| length2         = 2:27\n| title3          = Insomnia\n| length3         = 3:26\n| title4          = Since You Ask\n| length4         = 2:47\n| title5          = Feeling Your Pain\n| length5         = 3:22\n| title6          = A Pocket Full of Nothing\n| length6         = 3:33\n| title7          = Ella Fitzgerald\n| length7         = 3:35\n| title8          = Too Much of My Time\n| length8         = 4:38\n| title9          = Lump of Clay\n| length9         = 3:25\n| title10         = Hallelujah and Amen\n| length10        = 3:24\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''What Shall Become of the Baby?''

They would release two albums during their tenure.\n\n==Tenure with The Hooters==\nAfter Baby Grand disbanded, Hyman and Bazilian decided to try something new by combining [[reggae]], [[ska]], and [[rock'n'roll]] to create [[The Hooters]] in 1980.\n\n''[[Nervous Night (album)|Nervous Night]]'', [[The Hooters]]' 1985 debut on [[Columbia Records]], sold more than 2 million copies and included ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top 40 hits \"Day By Day\" (#18), \"[[And We Danced (The Hooters song)|And We Danced]]\" (#21) and \"Where Do The Children Go\" (#38).\n\nAfter releasing six albums, [[The Hooters]] obtained a large global following throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, they were asked to open three major musical events of the late 20th century: [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1985, [[Amnesty International]] Concert at [[Giants Stadium]] in 1986, and [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin]] in 1990.  In 1995, The Hooters went on hiatus, although Hyman and Bazilian would continue to collaborate on musical projects for other artists.\n\nBazilian reunited with The Hooters on successful headlining European summer tours in 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n\n2007 saw the release of ''[[Time Stand Still]]'', their first album of new material since 1993.\n\nIn 2009, they released \"[[Both Sides Live]]\", a double CD which featured a concert at Philadelphia's Electric Factory as well as a special acoustic performance recorded at [[Rob Hyman]]'s Elm Street Studios.\n\nIn 2010, to celebrate 30 years as a band, they released a five song EP entitled \"[[Five By Five]]\", produced by [[Nick Jameson]]. The EP featured the only \"official\" studio recordings by the band of Rob Hyman's \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and Bazilian's \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]\".\n\nThe Hooters continue to tour successfully in Germany and Scandinavia and perform special concert events in their native [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==\"One of Us\"==\nBazilian has become recognized internationally for being a songwriter, [[session musician]], arranger, and producer for many artists.\n\nIn 1995, he played all those roles for [[Joan Osborne]]'s major-label debut album ''[[Relish (album)|Relish]],'' which was nominated for six [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the No. 4 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]],\" which Bazilian wrote.\n\n\"One of Us\" has since been covered by many artists throughout the world, among them being [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Doctor Evil]] in ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', [[Martyn Joseph]], Scott Bradoka, Sharla Jackson Band, Wildside, Jackie \"O\", [[DJ Irene]], [[Outta Control]], and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]].\n\nIn 2003, \"One of Us\" was used as the [[theme song]] for the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. It has also appeared on the soundtracks of numerous movies, including ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001), ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'', (2003) and ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (film)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'' (2005).\n\nIn more recent years, [[The Hooters]] have also performed \"One of Us\" in their live shows.\n\n==Recognitions==\nOn November 17, 2000, Bazilian was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame on the [[Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia|Avenue of the Arts]].<ref>[http://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk_names.htm#b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727173419/http://www.philadelphiamusicalliance.org/walk_names.htm |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2004, Bazilian won an [[ASCAP]] Film and Television Music Award for \"[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]\" as the [[theme song]] for the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo career===\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''The Optimist'' (2000)\n| title1          = Driving in England\n| length1         = 4:19\n| title2          = Until You Dare\n| length2         = 4:17\n| title3          = Gemini Yo Yo\n| length3         = 4:32\n| title4          = Bye Bye Baby\n| length4         = 5:24\n| title5          = U.G.L.Y.\n| length5         = 3:45\n| title6          = When I Was the Man\n| length6         = 3:54\n| title7          = Kid from Outer Space\n| length7         = 5:03\n| title8          = By My Woman\n| length8         = 4:46\n| title9          = Fiddlesticks\n| length9         = 4:03\n| title10         = Hopelessly, Relentlessly\n| length10        = 5:11\n| title11         = Mind Going Down\n| length11        = 3:27\n| title12         = The Optimist / One of Us (Demo) [hidden track]\n| length12        = 9:30\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''A Very Dull Boy'' (2002)\n| title1          = A Very Dull Boy\n| length1         = 5:03\n| title2          = Lucky to Be\n| length2         = 2:27\n| title3          = Insomnia\n| length3         = 3:26\n| title4          = Since You Ask\n| length4         = 2:47\n| title5          = Feeling Your Pain\n| length5         = 3:22\n| title6          = A Pocket Full of Nothing\n| length6         = 3:33\n| title7          = Ella Fitzgerald\n| length7         = 3:35\n| title8          = Too Much of My Time\n| length8         = 4:38\n| title9          = Lump of Clay\n| length9         = 3:25\n| title10         = Hallelujah and Amen\n| length10        = 3:24\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''What Shall Become of the Baby?''

''Adventure Island'' was released in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in September of 1988 and in the [[PAL region]] in 1992 under the title of '''''Adventure Island Classic'''''.\n\n''Adventure Island'' is an adaptation of the arcade game ''[[Wonder Boy (video game)|Wonder Boy]]'', developed by [[Westone Bit Entertainment|Escape]] for [[Sega]]. ''Adventure Island'' was followed by a series of sequels with no connection to the ''[[Wonder Boy]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe player controls Master Higgins (known as Master Wigins in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Matt|last=Yeo|title=Things that Make You Go Boom!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=May 1997|page=42}}</ref> and as [[Takahashi Meijin]] in Japanese versions), a young man who ventured to Adventure Island in the South Pacific after hearing that the Evil Witch Doctor kidnapped Princess Tina. To rescue her, Higgins must survive a series of 32 stages. There are eight worlds called \"areas\", which are divided into four stages or \"rounds\" each, which are further divided into four checkpoints. When the player reaches the fourth round of each area, he must confront a boss at the end to continue to the next area. The game is completed when the player saves the girl after defeating the eighth and final form of the evil lord.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Adventure Island (NES) gameplay.gif|left|thumb|The first stage in the NES version.]]\nMaster Higgins (the player character) loses a life whenever he touches an enemy, an enemy's attack, a fire roast, or when he falls into a pitfall or a body of water. The player also has a health gauge that starts out with 11 points, which gradually depletes over time or whenever Higgins trips on a rock in his path. When Higgins' health gauge reaches zero, he will lose a life. If Higgins still has extra lives, he will revive at the last checkpoint he passed through. The game ends when all of Higgins' lives run out. To replenish his health, Higgins can pick up fruit or a milk bottle and has a maximum health of up to 16 points. When the player's score reaches 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and 200,000 points, Higgins will receive an extra life. Finding a bee-like fairy known as Honey Girl will grant Higgins invincibility for about ten seconds and allow him to kill enemies with a single touch. Also hidden in each stage is a special pot, which doubles the player's end-of-stage bonus.\n\nHiggins starts off each life without the ability to attack and can only gain the ability to attack by picking up a stone axe, which can be found in specific spots in each stage. When Higgins is wielding the stone axe, he can trade it for magical fireballs that have longer range and are capable of destroying rocks and rolling stones (which are invulnerable to the stone axe).\n\nTo break an egg, the player must touch it or hit it with a weapon twice. In addition to weapons, there are numerous bonus items inside. There is also the possibility of receiving a negative item, the eggplant, which drains Higgins' life meter. Some of the eggs are not immediately visible in plain sight. The locations of these \"hidden eggs\" are usually indicated when a weapon thrown by a player disappears before falling to the ground and are uncovered by jumping at the indicated spot. Some of these hidden spots do not contain hidden eggs, but instead a cloud that will warp the player to a bonus stage, which is instead uncovered by standing still for a short period of time. During bonus stages, the player can collect a series of fruits (each worth 500 points regardless of the type) until Higgins falls into a pitfall. However, instead of losing a life, he will return to the regular stage at the next checkpoint.\n\nAt the fourth round of each area, Higgins will confront a different form of the Evil Witch Doctor, the game's [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]]. He has the ability to change his head by up to eight different types. Higgins must defeat him by striking his head a specific number of times with his weapon. The number of hits required to defeat him increases with each area (his first form requires eight hits and every subsequent form requires two additional hits until the eighth and final form, which requires 22 hits). When the Evil Witch Doctor is defeated, he will change his head and escape to the next area. He uses the same attack in each form, with the only changes being his durability, speed and the speed of his fireball attacks. When Higgins defeats his final form, the Evil Witch Doctor will fall into a pit and the girl will be rescued.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Relation to ''Wonder Boy''===\n''Adventure Island'' began development as a direct port of the [[Sega]] arcade game ''[[Wonder Boy]]'', the partial rights to which Hudson Soft obtained from developer Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). However, the developer had already signed away ownership of the Wonder Boy name and characters to Sega<ref>{{cite web |title=The Legend of Wonder Boy |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/14/the-legend-of-wonder-boy |website=IGN |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>, so Hudson created a new protagonist modeled and named after Hudson Soft's spokesman [[Takahashi Meijin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/master-higgins-speaks_2?pager.offset=1|title=Master Higgins Speaks from 1UP.com|quote=Around 1986, there was an arcade game called Wonder Boy that we at Hudson all liked, and there was a suggestion within the company to turn that into a Famicom game. So the vice president and I went to take a look at the development of the character and the game, and as we were looking at the character being built, the character already somewhat resembled me. The vice president was looking at it and went, \"Y'know, that character sort of looks like you, and you are a celebrity \u2013 it doesn't make any sense for us not to make this game about you.\" So they decided to turn me into that character, and that's how Adventure Island was born.|access-date=2011-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020015030/http://www.1up.com/features/master-higgins-speaks_2?pager.offset=1|archive-date=2012-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the western version of ''Adventure Island'', the Takahashi Meijin character was renamed Master Higgins.\n\nWhile the ''Wonder Boy'' series adopted an action RPG system for its sequels (beginning with ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster Land]]''), most of the ''Adventure Island'' sequels stuck to the game system of the original ''Wonder Boy''. Moreover, Hudson Soft also obtained the rights to port all of the ''Wonder Boy'' sequels to the [[TurboGrafx-16]], changing the title and character designs of each game (with the exception of ''[[Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair]]''). Incidentally, the Japanese version of ''Dragon's Curse'' (the TurboGrafx-16 adaptation of ''[[Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap]]'') was titled ''Adventure Island''.\n\nThe rights to the ''Adventure Island'' series are currently owned by [[Konami]], who absorbed Hudson Soft in 2012.\n\n===Re-releases===\nThe NES version of ''Adventure Island'' was re-released in Japan for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as a [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini]] title on May 21, 2004.<ref>https://www.cnet.com/products/famicom-mini-adventure-island-game-boy-advance/specs/</ref> It was later re-released internationally for the [[Virtual Console]] service in 2008 for the [[Wii]] and in 2014 for the [[Wii U]].<ref>http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/adventure_island</ref><ref>http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/adventure-island-wii-u</ref>\n\nA remake was also developed for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] titled ''Hudson Selection Volume 4: Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima'', which was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 2003.\n\n===Sequels===\nTwo sequels were produced for the NES, ''[[Adventure Island II]]'' and ''[[Adventure Island 3]]'', as well as a fourth game for the Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan titled ''[[Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima IV]]''.<ref>http://ca.ign.com/games/adventure-island-ii/nes-6023</ref><ref>http://ca.ign.com/games/adventure-island-3/nes-6024</ref> In addition to the standalone Famicom Mini re-release of the first game, all four games were re-released in a compilation for the Game Boy Advance titled ''Hudson Best Collection Vol 6: B\u014dken Jima Collection'', released in Japan on January 19, 2006.<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/hudson-best-collection-vol-6-bouken-jima-collect/</ref>\n\nSequels were also released on other platforms, such as ''Adventure Island'' and ''Adventure Island II'' for the [[Game Boy]] (based on the second and third NES games respectively), ''[[Super Adventure Island]]'' and ''[[Super Adventure Island II]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[New Adventure Island]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], ''[[Adventure Island: The Beginning]]'' for the [[Wii]], ''Gacha wa shi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima'' in 2007 for mobile, and ''Adventure Island Quest by Takahashi Meijin'' in 2010 for mobile.\n\n===Appearances in other games===\nTakahashi Meijin appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'', released in Japan for [[GameCube]] on December 13, 2003.\n\nTakahashi Meijin also appears in the sport mobile game ''Gachapin & Mukku no Dai Undoukai'' (\"Gachapin & Mukku's Big Sports Day\") in 2008, and crosses over with [[Katamari]] franchise in the mobile game ''Takahashi Meijin and Katamari Damacy'' in 2010.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            =

''Adventure Island'' was released in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in September of 1988 and in the [[PAL region]] in 1992 under the title of '''''Adventure Island Classic'''''.\n\n''Adventure Island'' is an adaptation of the arcade game ''[[Wonder Boy (video game)|Wonder Boy]]'', developed by [[Westone Bit Entertainment|Escape]] for [[Sega]]. ''Adventure Island'' was followed by a series of sequels with no connection to the ''[[Wonder Boy]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe player controls Master Higgins (known as Master Wigins in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Matt|last=Yeo|title=Things that Make You Go Boom!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=May 1997|page=42}}</ref> and as [[Takahashi Meijin]] in Japanese versions), a young man who ventured to Adventure Island in the South Pacific after hearing that the Evil Witch Doctor kidnapped Princess Tina. To rescue her, Higgins must survive a series of 32 stages. There are eight worlds called \"areas\", which are divided into four stages or \"rounds\" each, which are further divided into four checkpoints. When the player reaches the fourth round of each area, he must confront a boss at the end to continue to the next area. The game is completed when the player saves the girl after defeating the eighth and final form of the evil lord.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Adventure Island (NES) gameplay.gif|left|thumb|The first stage in the NES version.]]\nMaster Higgins (the player character) loses a life whenever he touches an enemy, an enemy's attack, a fire roast, or when he falls into a pitfall or a body of water. The player also has a health gauge that starts out with 11 points, which gradually depletes over time or whenever Higgins trips on a rock in his path. When Higgins' health gauge reaches zero, he will lose a life. If Higgins still has extra lives, he will revive at the last checkpoint he passed through. The game ends when all of Higgins' lives run out. To replenish his health, Higgins can pick up fruit or a milk bottle and has a maximum health of up to 16 points. When the player's score reaches 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and 200,000 points, Higgins will receive an extra life. Finding a bee-like fairy known as Honey Girl will grant Higgins invincibility for about ten seconds and allow him to kill enemies with a single touch. Also hidden in each stage is a special pot, which doubles the player's end-of-stage bonus.\n\nHiggins starts off each life without the ability to attack and can only gain the ability to attack by picking up a stone axe, which can be found in specific spots in each stage. When Higgins is wielding the stone axe, he can trade it for magical fireballs that have longer range and are capable of destroying rocks and rolling stones (which are invulnerable to the stone axe).\n\nTo break an egg, the player must touch it or hit it with a weapon twice. In addition to weapons, there are numerous bonus items inside. There is also the possibility of recieving a negative item, the eggplant, which drains Higgins' life meter. Some of the eggs are not immediately visible in plain sight. The locations of these \"hidden eggs\" are usually indicated when a weapon thrown by a player disappears before falling to the ground and are uncovered by jumping at the indicated spot. Some of these hidden spots don't contain hidden eggs, but instead a cloud that will warp the player to a bonus stage, which is instead uncovered by standing still for a short period of time. During bonus stages, the player can collect a series of fruits (each worth 500 points regardless of the type) until Higgins falls into a pitfall. However, instead of losing a life, he will return to the regular stage at the next checkpoint.\n\nAt the fourth round of each area, Higgins will confront a different form of the Evil Witch Doctor, the game's [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]]. He has the ability to change his head by up to eight different types. Higgins must defeat him by striking his head a specific number of times with his weapon. The number of hits required to defeat him increases with each area (his first form requires eight hits and every subsequent form requires two additional hits until the eighth and final form, which requires 22 hits). When the Evil Witch Doctor is defeated, he will change his head and escape to the next area. He uses the same attack in each form, with the only changes being his durability, speed and the speed of his fireball attacks. When Higgins defeats his final form, the Evil Witch Doctor will fall into a pit and the girl will be rescued.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Relation to ''Wonder Boy''===\n''Adventure Island'' began development as a direct port of the [[Sega]] arcade game ''[[Wonder Boy]]'', the partial rights to which Hudson Soft obtained from developer Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). However, the developer had already signed away ownership of the Wonder Boy name and characters to Sega<ref>{{cite web |title=The Legend of Wonder Boy |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/14/the-legend-of-wonder-boy |website=IGN |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>, so Hudson created a new protagonist modeled and named after Hudson Soft's spokesman [[Takahashi Meijin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/master-higgins-speaks_2?pager.offset=1|title=Master Higgins Speaks from 1UP.com|quote=Around 1986, there was an arcade game called Wonder Boy that we at Hudson all liked, and there was a suggestion within the company to turn that into a Famicom game. So the vice president and I went to take a look at the development of the character and the game, and as we were looking at the character being built, the character already somewhat resembled me. The vice president was looking at it and went, \"Y'know, that character sort of looks like you, and you are a celebrity \u2013 it doesn't make any sense for us not to make this game about you.\" So they decided to turn me into that character, and that's how Adventure Island was born.|access-date=2011-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020015030/http://www.1up.com/features/master-higgins-speaks_2?pager.offset=1|archive-date=2012-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the western version of ''Adventure Island'', the Takahashi Meijin character was renamed Master Higgins.\n\nWhile the ''Wonder Boy'' series adopted an action RPG system for its sequels (beginning with ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster Land]]''), most of the ''Adventure Island'' sequels stuck to the game system of the original ''Wonder Boy''. Moreover, Hudson Soft also obtained the rights to port all of the ''Wonder Boy'' sequels to the [[TurboGrafx-16]], changing the title and character designs of each game (with the exception of ''[[Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair]]''). Incidentally, the Japanese version of ''Dragon's Curse'' (the TurboGrafx-16 adaptation of ''[[Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap]]'') was titled ''Adventure Island''.\n\nThe rights to the ''Adventure Island'' series are currently owned by [[Konami]], who absorbed Hudson Soft in 2012.\n\n===Re-releases===\nThe NES version of ''Adventure Island'' was re-released in Japan for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as a [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini]] title on May 21, 2004.<ref>https://www.cnet.com/products/famicom-mini-adventure-island-game-boy-advance/specs/</ref> It was later re-released internationally for the [[Virtual Console]] service in 2008 for the [[Wii]] and in 2014 for the [[Wii U]].<ref>http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/adventure_island</ref><ref>http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/adventure-island-wii-u</ref>\n\nA remake was also developed for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] titled ''Hudson Selection Volume 4: Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima'', which was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 2003.\n\n===Sequels===\nTwo sequels were produced for the NES, ''[[Adventure Island II]]'' and ''[[Adventure Island 3]]'', as well as a fourth game for the Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan titled ''[[Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima IV]]''.<ref>http://ca.ign.com/games/adventure-island-ii/nes-6023</ref><ref>http://ca.ign.com/games/adventure-island-3/nes-6024</ref> In addition to the standalone Famicom Mini re-release of the first game, all four games were re-released in a compilation for the Game Boy Advance titled ''Hudson Best Collection Vol 6: B\u014dken Jima Collection'', released in Japan on January 19, 2006.<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/hudson-best-collection-vol-6-bouken-jima-collect/</ref>\n\nSequels were also released on other platforms, such as ''Adventure Island'' and ''Adventure Island II'' for the [[Game Boy]] (based on the second and third NES games respectively), ''[[Super Adventure Island]]'' and ''[[Super Adventure Island II]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[New Adventure Island]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], ''[[Adventure Island: The Beginning]]'' for the [[Wii]], ''Gacha wa shi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima'' in 2007 for mobile, and ''Adventure Island Quest by Takahashi Meijin'' in 2010 for mobile.\n\n===Appearances in other games===\nTakahashi Meijin appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'', released in Japan for [[GameCube]] on December 13, 2003.\n\nTakahashi Meijin also appears in the sport mobile game ''Gachapin & Mukku no Dai Undoukai'' (\"Gachapin & Mukku's Big Sports Day\") in 2008, and crosses over with [[Katamari]] franchise in the mobile game ''Takahashi Meijin and Katamari Damacy'' in 2010.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            =

He is remembered for being made the butt of satires by [[Andrew Marvell]] in 1681 and by [[John Dryden]] in ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' in 1682.\n\n==Life==\nLittle is known of Flecknoe's life. He was probably of English birth, from Northamptonshire, though he may have been of Irish heritage. He was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and may have been ordained a lay-priest by the [[Jesuit]]s while abroad.<ref>''The Poems of Andrew Marvell'', edited by Nigel Smith, Pearson Education 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AF1dZ81TNtgC&lpg=PA166&ots=X-BHEgc-5u&dq=Richard%20Flecknoe%20%20%22John%20Oldham%22&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q=Richard%20Flecknoe%20%20%22John%20Oldham%22&f=false pp.166-8]</ref> There was once a suggestion that he may have been the nephew of the Jesuit William Flecknoe or Flexney of Oxford, though there is no evidence of this.<ref>''Bibliographical Dictionary of the English Catholics'', vol. ii., 1885</ref> Much of his early life seems to have been spent outside England. He attended [[Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Li\u00e8ge|St Omer English Jesuit School]] from 1619 to 1624, where he may have taken part in the annual drama productions: in 1623 the play was ''[[Guy of Warwick]]''.

Their ranks consisted of both [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] people, and they raided the entire [[Border country]] without regard to their victims' nationality. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the [[House of Stuart]] in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[House of Tudor]] in the [[Kingdom of England]]\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Dryhope Tower - geograph.org.uk - 195093.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Dryhope Tower]] built in the 1500s for protection against the reivers]]\nScotland and England were frequently at war during the late [[Middle Ages]]. During these wars, the livelihood of the people on the Borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not formally at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in either or both kingdoms was often weak, particularly in remote locations. The difficulty and uncertainties of basic human survival meant that communities and/or people kindred to each other would seek security through group strength and cunning. They would attempt to improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense, enemies who were frequently also just trying to survive. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for [[Raid (military)|depredations]] rather than conferring any security.\n\nThere were other factors which promoted a [[Predation|predatory]] mode of living in the Borders. A system of inheritance called [[gavelkind]] meant that estates, and particularly land, were divided equally between all sons on a man's death; although this was considered more fair than [[primogeniture]], it also meant that many people owned insufficient land to survive.<ref name=Durham5>Durham & McBride, p.5</ref> Also, much of the border region is mountainous or open moorland, unsuitable for arable farming but good for grazing. Livestock was easily rustled and driven back to raiders' territory by mounted reivers who knew the country well. The raiders also often removed easily portable household goods or valuables, and took prisoners for ransom.\n\nThe attitudes of the English and Scottish governments towards the border families alternated from indulgence and even encouragement, as these fierce families served as the first line of defence against invasion across the border, to draconian and indiscriminate punishment when their lawlessness became intolerable to the authorities.\n\n''Reive'', a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) ''reifen.'' The verb ''reave'' meaning \"plunder, rob\", a closely related word, comes from the Middle English ''reven''. There also exists a [[Northumbrian English|Northumbrian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''reifen.''  All three derive from [[Old English]] ''r\u0113afian'' which means \"to rob, plunder, pillage\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Reiver merriam-webster.com]</ref> The corresponding verb in Dutch is \"(be)roven\", and \"(be)rauben\" in German.\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:WatHarden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Walter Scott of Harden|Auld Wat of Harden]]'' by [[Tom Scott (painter)|Tom Scott]]. A romanticised image of a notorious raider, Walter Scott of Harden.]]\nThe reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]], and Scottish raids were known as far south as [[Yorkshire]]. The largest of these was [[The Great Raid of 1322]], during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], where it reached as far south as [[Chorley]]. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.38</ref>\n\nWhen raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: [[Galloway pony]], [[Hobelar]]). The original dress of a [[Northumbrian tartan|shepherd's plaid]] was later replaced by light armour such as [[brigandine]]s or [[Jack of plate|jacks of plate]] (a type of sleeveless [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as [[burgonet]]s or [[Morion (helmet)|morions]]; hence their nickname of the \"steel bonnets\". They were armed with light lances and small shields, and sometimes also with [[longbow]]s, or light [[crossbow]]s, known as \"latches\", or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried [[sword]]s and [[dirk]]s.\n\n==Borderers as soldiers==\nBorder reivers were sometimes in demand as [[mercenaries|mercenary soldiers]], owing to their recognized skills as light [[cavalry]].  Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the [[Low Countries]] and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] and [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]]. After meeting one reiver (the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|''Bold Buccleugh'']]), [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is quoted as having said that \"with ten thousand such men, [[James VI and I|James VI]] could shake any throne in Europe.\" \n\nThese borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly-behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as [[Battle of Ancrum Moor|Ancrum Moor]] in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in 1547, an observer ([[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]]) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.<ref>Moffat</ref>\n\n==Dwellings and fortifications==\n[[File:Black Middens Bastle - geograph.org.uk - 1224658.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black Middens Bastle House]], a surviving bastle house near [[Kielder Water]] in Northumberland]]\n\nThe inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]]s.\n\nIn the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The [[bastle house]] was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.24</ref> Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.\n\n[[Peel tower]]s (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. [[Smailholm Tower]] is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.23</ref>\n\nPeel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.\n\n==Law and order==\n[[File:Late-medieval jack, National Museum of Scotland collection.jpg|thumb|A leather jack of the kind worn by reivers in the 16th century]]\nDuring periods of nominal peace, a special body of [[customary law]], known as [[March law (Anglo-Scottish border)|March law]] or Border law, grew up to deal with the situation. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This \"hot trod\" had to proceed with \"hound and horne, hew and cry\",<ref>Durham & McBride, p. 20.</ref> making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a [[sleuth hound]] (also known as a \"slew dogge\") to follow raiders' tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least).<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The \"cold trod\" mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of \"following the trod\".<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p. 215 fn.</ref>\n\nBoth sides of the border were divided into [[Scottish Marches|Marches]], each under a [[Lord Warden of the Marches|march warden]]. The march wardens' various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. On occasion, march wardens could make ''warden roades'' to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials.\n\nThe march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms' march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as \"Days of Truce\", were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days.\n\nMarch wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as [[Sir John Forster]], who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp.139\u2013140</ref>\n\nBy the death of [[Elizabeth I of England]], things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.210</ref> When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as \"Ill Week\", resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.360</ref> Upon his accession to the English throne, [[James I of England|James VI]] of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term \"Borders\" in favour of \"Middle [[Shire]]s,\" and dealing out stern justice to reivers.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent [[Union of the Crowns]] was enacted; it was [[long title]]d ''An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come''. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n226/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.195</ref> Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1 c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled ''An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.''

Under section two of the act, the [[benefit of clergy]] was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.&nbsp;581</ref>\n\nGenerally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent \"theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\", these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years.

Its holder, the Keeper of Liddesdale, usually had equal status to the Scottish Wardens of the Marches.]]\nThe Border families can be referred to as clans, as the [[Scot]]s themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] of 1587 there is the description of the \"Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris\" \u2013 thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said \"By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan\". Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the [[MacDonald]] family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOther terms were also used to describe the Border families, such as the \"Riding Surnames\" and the \"Graynes\" thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their [[Sept (social)|sept]]s. e.g. [[Clan Donald]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Sleat]], can be compared with the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Scotts of Buccleuch]] and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, and had territories in which most of their kindred lived. Border families did practice customs similar to those of the [[Gaels]], such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of [[manrent]]. Although feudalism existed, loyalty to kin was much more important and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===Marches===\n\nIn 1587 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a statute: \"For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.\"<ref>Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466\u2013467 (1587)</ref> Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands.

It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.\n\nRiders did not wear identifying [[tartan]]s. The tradition of family tartans dates from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era and was inspired by the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The typical dress of reivers included [[trews]], [[Jack of plate]], steel bonnets ([[helmet]]s), and [[riding boot]]s.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossing the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels.jpg|thumb|310px|left|Skills of horsemanship are kept alive in the Borders: fording the [[River Tweed]] on Braw Lad's Day, [[Galashiels]] 2011]]\n[[File:Galashiels Reiver Statue 02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Reiver statue at Galashiels]]\nLong after they were gone, the reivers were romanticised by writers such as [[Sir Walter Scott]] (''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''), although he made mistakes; the term [[Moss-trooper]], which he used, refers to one of the robbers that existed after the real Reivers had been put down. Nevertheless, Scott was a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad. The stories of legendary border reivers like [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the \"Dish of Spurs\" which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to acquire more plunder. Scottish author [[Nigel Tranter]] revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels.  Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869\u20131963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including ''The reiver's heart'' (1903), ''The raiders'' (1904), ''Whaup o' the rede: a ballad of the border raiders'' (1909), ''[[Kirkhope Tower]]'' (1913), and ''Ho! for the blades of Harden''.\n\nThe names of the [[Reiver]] families are still very much apparent amongst the inhabitants of the [[Scottish Borders]], Northumberland and [[Cumbria]] today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as 'annual re-runs of the bloody [[Battle of Otterburn]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.\n\n[[Hawick]] in Scotland holds an annual Reivers' festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of [[Duns]] is headed by the \"Reiver\" and \"Reiver's Lass\", a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency's first two leaflets from the 'Scots Legacy' series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.\n\nBorderers (particularly those banished by [[James VI of Scotland]]) took part in the [[plantation of Ulster]] becoming the people known as [[Ulster-Scots]] ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster with names such as Elliot, Armstrong, Beattie, Bell, Carruthers, Hume and Heron, Rutledge, and Turnbulls amongst others.\n\nBorder surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of [[Scots-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] settlement in the United States, and particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the [[Upland South]]. Author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, [[Neil Armstrong]], was the first person to set foot on the moon. In 1972 Armstrong was made a [[Freedom of the city|freeman]] of the town of [[Langholm]] in Scotland, the home of his ancestors.\n\nThe artist [[Gordon Young (artist)|Gordon Young]] created a public art work in Carlisle: ''Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement'', a nod to [[Gavin Dunbar (archbishop of Glasgow)|Gavin Dunbar]], the Archbishop of Glasgow's 1525 ''Monition of Cursing''.  Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects [[Tullie House Museum]] to [[Carlisle Castle]] under a main road, and part of the bishop's curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|title=Cursing Stone & Reiver Pavement / Carlisle, 2001|publisher=Gordon Young|accessdate=23 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227133140/http://gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Debatable Lands]]\n* [[History of Northumberland]]\n* ''[[The Borderers]]'' (Television series)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Carey|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth|title=The Stirring World of Robert Carey, Robert Carey's Memoirs 1577\u20131625|publisher=RippingYarns.com|isbn=1-904466-29-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Durham|first=Keith|author2=McBride, Angus|title=The Border Reivers: The story of the Anglo-Scottish borderlands|year=1995|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-85532-417-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781855324176}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Garth|title=War Stories: Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-4012-1039-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York}}\n* {{cite book|last=Howker|first=Janni|authorlink=Janni Howker|title=Martin Farrell|year=1997|publisher=Red Fox|isbn=978-0-09-918161-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=MacDonald Fraser|first=George|authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser|title=The Steel Bonnets|year=1971|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-272746-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Reivers|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-674-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Rob|title=The Border Reivers: A stain on the image of Tudor England|publisher=[[Medieval History Magazine]]|volume=4|date=December 2003}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moss|first=Tom|title=Deadlock and Deliverance: The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong|year=2007|publisher=Rose Cottage Publications|isbn=978-0-9558016-0-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tait|first=Jon|title=Dick the Devil's Bairns: Breaking the Border Mafia|year=2018|publisher=Tredition|isbn=978-3-7482-2361-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.borderreivers.co.uk The Border Reivers Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090126155155/http://nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm The Border Reivers]\n* [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/ Border Reivers DNA Project]\n* [http://the-border-reivers.co.uk Yet Another Border Reivers Website]\n* [http://www.everymansprey.com The Routledge Reivers]\n* [http://www.reivershistory.co.uk The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074111/http://www.go-britain.com/html/borders_map.htm#borders Borders Map with surnames]\n\n{{Scottish clans}}\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Scottish border]]\n[[Category:History of Europe]]\n[[Category:Border Reivers| ]]\n[[Category:Cavalry]]\n[[Category:History of Cumberland]]\n[[Category:History of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:History of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Military history of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:History of the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Tudor England]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{redirect|Reivers|the actor|David Reivers|articles with similar names|The Reivers (disambiguation)}}\n{{engvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Reivers raid on Gilnockie Tower.jpg|thumb|Reivers at [[Gilnockie Tower]], from a 19th-century print|alt=|366x366px]]\n[[File:Wat o' Harden's horn.JPG|thumb|273x273px|Notorious raider, [[Walter Scott of Harden]]'s horn, noted in a poem called the \"The Reiver's Wedding\" by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]:\n\n\n\"He took a bugle frae his side,\n\nWith names carved o'er and o'er,\n\nFull many a chief of meikle pride,\n\nThat Border bugle bore.\"\n\n\n(A fragment of the full poem.)]]\n'''Border reivers''' were [[Cattle raiding|raiders]] along the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] from the late 13th century to the beginning of the 17th century. Their ranks consisted of both [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] people, and they raided the entire [[Border country]] without regard to their victims' nationality. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the [[House of Stuart]] in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[House of Tudor]] in the [[Kingdom of England]]\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Dryhope Tower - geograph.org.uk - 195093.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Dryhope Tower]] built in the 1500s for protection against the reivers]]\nScotland and England were frequently at war during the late [[Middle Ages]]. During these wars, the livelihood of the people on the Borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not formally at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in either or both kingdoms was often weak, particularly in remote locations. The difficulty and uncertainties of basic human survival meant that communities and/or people kindred to each other would seek security through group strength and cunning. They would attempt to improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense, enemies who were frequently also just trying to survive. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for [[Raid (military)|depredations]] rather than conferring any security.\n\nThere were other factors which promoted a [[Predation|predatory]] mode of living in the Borders. A system of inheritance called [[gavelkind]] meant that estates, and particularly land, were divided equally between all sons on a man's death; although this was considered more fair than [[primogeniture]], it also meant that many people owned insufficient land to survive.<ref name=Durham5>Durham & McBride, p.5</ref> Also, much of the border region is mountainous or open moorland, unsuitable for arable farming but good for grazing. Livestock was easily rustled and driven back to raiders' territory by mounted reivers who knew the country well. The raiders also often removed easily portable household goods or valuables, and took prisoners for ransom.\n\nThe attitudes of the English and Scottish governments towards the border families alternated from indulgence and even encouragement, as these fierce families served as the first line of defence against invasion across the border, to draconian and indiscriminate punishment when their lawlessness became intolerable to the authorities.\n\n''Reive'', a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) ''reifen.'' The verb ''reave'' meaning \"plunder, rob\", a closely related word, comes from the Middle English ''reven''. There also exists a [[Northumbrian English|Northumbrian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''reifen.''  All three derive from [[Old English]] ''r\u0113afian'' which means \"to rob, plunder, pillage\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Reiver merriam-webster.com]</ref> The corresponding verb in Dutch is \"(be)roven\", and \"(be)rauben\" in German.\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:WatHarden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Walter Scott of Harden|Auld Wat of Harden]]'' by [[Tom Scott (painter)|Tom Scott]]. A romanticised image of a notorious raider, Walter Scott of Harden.]]\nThe reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]], and Scottish raids were known as far south as [[Yorkshire]]. The largest of these was [[The Great Raid of 1322]], during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], where it reached as far south as [[Chorley]]. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.38</ref>\n\nWhen raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: [[Galloway pony]], [[Hobelar]]). The original dress of a [[Northumbrian tartan|shepherd's plaid]] was later replaced by light armour such as [[brigandine]]s or [[Jack of plate|jacks of plate]] (a type of sleeveless [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as [[burgonet]]s or [[Morion (helmet)|morions]]; hence their nickname of the \"steel bonnets\". They were armed with light lances and small shields, and sometimes also with [[longbow]]s, or light [[crossbow]]s, known as \"latches\", or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried [[sword]]s and [[dirk]]s.\n\n==Borderers as soldiers==\nBorder reivers were sometimes in demand as [[mercenaries|mercenary soldiers]], owing to their recognized skills as light [[cavalry]].  Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the [[Low Countries]] and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] and [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]]. After meeting one reiver (the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|''Bold Buccleugh'']]), [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is quoted as having said that \"with ten thousand such men, [[James VI and I|James VI]] could shake any throne in Europe.\" \n\nThese borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly-behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as [[Battle of Ancrum Moor|Ancrum Moor]] in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in 1547, an observer ([[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]]) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.<ref>Moffat</ref>\n\n==Dwellings and fortifications==\n[[File:Black Middens Bastle - geograph.org.uk - 1224658.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black Middens Bastle House]], a surviving bastle house near [[Kielder Water]] in Northumberland]]\n\nThe inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]]s.\n\nIn the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The [[bastle house]] was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.24</ref> Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.\n\n[[Peel tower]]s (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. [[Smailholm Tower]] is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.<ref>Durham & McBride, p.23</ref>\n\nPeel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.\n\n==Law and order==\n[[File:Late-medieval jack, National Museum of Scotland collection.jpg|thumb|A leather jack of the kind worn by reivers in the 16th century]]\nDuring periods of nominal peace, a special body of [[customary law]], known as [[March law (Anglo-Scottish border)|March law]] or Border law, grew up to deal with the situation. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This \"hot trod\" had to proceed with \"hound and horne, hew and cry\",<ref>Durham & McBride, p. 20.</ref> making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a [[sleuth hound]] (also known as a \"slew dogge\") to follow raiders' tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least).<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The \"cold trod\" mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of \"following the trod\".<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p. 215 fn.</ref>\n\nBoth sides of the border were divided into [[Scottish Marches|Marches]], each under a [[Lord Warden of the Marches|march warden]]. The march wardens' various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. On occasion, march wardens could make ''warden roades'' to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials.\n\nThe march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms' march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as \"Days of Truce\", were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days.\n\nMarch wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as [[Sir John Forster]], who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, pp.139\u2013140</ref>\n\nBy the death of [[Elizabeth I of England]], things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.210</ref> When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as \"Ill Week\", resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor.<ref>George MacDonald Fraser, p.360</ref> Upon his accession to the English throne, [[James I of England|James VI]] of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term \"Borders\" in favour of \"Middle [[Shire]]s,\" and dealing out stern justice to reivers.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent [[Union of the Crowns]] was enacted; it was [[long title]]d ''An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come''. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n226/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.195</ref> Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1 c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled ''An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.'' To deal with cross-border flight, the act allowed the trial of an Englishman in Scotland if the felony was committed there, and he was later arrested in England; it became effective after a similar act had been passed in Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n248/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.216]</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and long-running lawlessness by [[Moss-trooper|Moss troopers]] nearly six decades later, parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1662 (13 & 14 Cha. 2. c. 22) for the border area; it was [[long title]]d ''An Act for preventing of Theft and Rapine upon the Northern Borders of England.'' Section seven of the act revives both previous acts passed under James I.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp417-418 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.417</ref> With the 1662 act about to expire, the sixth session of [[Cavalier Parliament]] passed the Moss Troopers Act 1666 (18 Cha. 2 c. 3), long titled ''An Act to continue a former Act for preventing of Thefte and Rapine upon the Northerne Borders of England.'' Under section two of the act, the [[benefit of clergy]] was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.&nbsp;581</ref>\n\nGenerally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent \"theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\", these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years. The initial acts include the Moss Trooper Acts of 1677 (29 & 30 Cha. 2 c. 2),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge29britgoog#page/n447/mode/2up \"An act for continuance of two former acts for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\"]</ref> 1685 (1 Jas. 2 c.  14),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge29britgoog#page/n485/mode/2up \"An act for the continuance of three former acts for preventing of theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\"]</ref> 1695 (7 & 8 Will. 3 c.  17),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge38britgoog#page/n441/mode/2up \"An act for the continuing four former acts for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England\"]</ref> 1700 (12 & 13 Will. 3 c. 6),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge31britgoog#page/n411/mode/2up \"An act for continuing the acts therein mentioned for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England\"]</ref> and 1712 (12 Ann. c. 10).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge69britgoog#page/n58/mode/2up \"An act for continuing the acts therein mentioned, for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\"]</ref> Starting in 1732, although the 'Moss trooper' [[short title]] was dropped, the enforcement acts were continued by other variously named acts, most of which continued the established descriptive phrase \"for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England\", as the first item included.  These later acts include the Perpetuation of Various Laws Act 1732 (6 Geo. 2 c.  37),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge03britgoog#page/n484/mode/2up \u201cAn act ... and for continuing an act made in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the reign of King Charles the Second, for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; and for reviving and continuing certain clauses in two other acts made for the same purpose\"]</ref> the Universities (Wine Licences) Act 1743 (17 Geo. 2 c. 40),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge01britgoog#page/n318/mode/2up \"An act to continue the several laws therein mentioned for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; ...\"]</ref> and the Continuance of Acts, 1750 (24 Geo. 2 c. 57),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge67britgoog#page/n342/mode/2up \"An act to continue the several laws therein mentioned; for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; ...\"]</ref> which continued previous acts until 1 September 1757 \"and from thence to the end of the then next session of parliament\".\n\n==Border surnames and clan status==\n[[File:Hermitage Castle 06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hermitage Castle]], the strength of [[Liddesdale]] and an important stronghold for the Scottish Marches. Its holder, the Keeper of Liddesdale, usually had equal status to the Scottish Wardens of the Marches.]]\nThe Border families can be referred to as clans, as the [[Scot]]s themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] of 1587 there is the description of the \"Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris\" \u2013 thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said \"By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan\". Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the [[MacDonald]] family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOther terms were also used to describe the Border families, such as the \"Riding Surnames\" and the \"Graynes\" thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their [[Sept (social)|sept]]s. e.g. [[Clan Donald]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Sleat]], can be compared with the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Scotts of Buccleuch]] and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, and had territories in which most of their kindred lived. Border families did practice customs similar to those of the [[Gaels]], such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of [[manrent]]. Although feudalism existed, loyalty to kin was much more important and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===Marches===\n\nIn 1587 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a statute: \"For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.\"<ref>Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466\u2013467 (1587)</ref> Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands. The Borders portion listed 17 'clannis' with a Chief and their associated Marches:\n[[File:Marches_map.JPG|right|thumb|Regions of the Scottish marches]]\n'''''Middle March'''''\n*[[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], Nixon, Crozier\n'''''West March'''''\n*Scott, Bates, Little, [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]], Glendenning, Irvine, Bell, [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], [[Graham (surname)|Graham]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], Jardine, Moffat and Latimer.\n\nOf the Border Clans or Graynes listed on this roll, [[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], [[Clan Scott|Scott]], [[Clan Irvine|Irvine]], [[Clan Graham|Graham]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Clan Jardine|Jardine]] and [[Clan Moffat|Moffat]] are registered with the Court of Lord Lyon in Edinburgh as Scottish Clans (with a Chief), others such as [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], [[Clan Little|Little]] and Bell are [[armigerous]] clans with no Chief, while such as [[Clan Blackadder]], also an [[armigerous]] clan in the Middle Ages, later died out or lost their lands, and are unregistered with the Lyon Court.\n\nThe historic riding surnames recorded by George MacDonald Fraser in ''The Steel Bonnets'' (1989)<ref>George McDonald Fraser, pp.&nbsp;56\u201365</ref> are:\n\n'''''East March'''''\n* Scotland: [[Clan Home|Hume]], [[Clan Trotter|Trotter]], [[Dixon Baronets|Dixon]], [[Bromfield (surname)|Bromfield]], [[Craw (surname)|Craw]], [[Clan Cranstoun|Cranston]].\n* England: [[Forster (surname)|Forster]], [[Selby family|Selby]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], [[Dunn (surname)|Dunn]].\n'''''Middle March'''''\n* Scotland: Burns, [[Clan Kerr|Kerr]], [[Clan Young|Young]], [[Clan Pringle|Pringle]], Davison, Gilchrist, [[Tait (surname)|Tait]] of East Teviotdale.

Charlton, Robson, Dodd, Dodds, Milburn, Yarrow, [[Stapleton (surname)|Stapleton]] of Tynedale. Also Fenwick, [[Ogle family|Ogle]], Heron, Witherington, Medford (later [[Mitford family|Mitford]]), Collingwood, Carnaby, Shaftoe, Ridley, Stokoe, Stamper, Wilkinson, Hunter, [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]], Jamieson.\n'''''West March'''''\n* Scotland: Bell, [[Clan Irvine|Irvine]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Clan Maxwell|Maxwell]], Carlisle, Beattie, [[Clan Little|Little]], [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], Glendenning, Routledge, [[Clan Moffat|Moffat]].\n* England: Graham, [[Hetherington]], Musgrave, Storey, Lowther, Curwen, [[Salkeld]], Dacre, Harden, [[Hodgson]], Routledge, Tailor, Noble.\n\nRelationships between the Border clans varied from uneasy alliance to open, deadly [[feud]]. It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.\n\nRiders did not wear identifying [[tartan]]s. The tradition of family tartans dates from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era and was inspired by the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The typical dress of reivers included [[trews]], [[Jack of plate]], steel bonnets ([[helmet]]s), and [[riding boot]]s.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossing the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels.jpg|thumb|310px|left|Skills of horsemanship are kept alive in the Borders: fording the [[River Tweed]] on Braw Lad's Day, [[Galashiels]] 2011]]\n[[File:Galashiels Reiver Statue 02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Reiver statue at Galashiels]]\nLong after they were gone, the reivers were romanticised by writers such as [[Sir Walter Scott]] (''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''), although he made mistakes; the term [[Moss-trooper]], which he used, refers to one of the robbers that existed after the real Reivers had been put down. Nevertheless, Scott was a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad. The stories of legendary border reivers like [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the \"Dish of Spurs\" which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to acquire more plunder. Scottish author [[Nigel Tranter]] revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels.  Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869\u20131963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including ''The reiver's heart'' (1903), ''The raiders'' (1904), ''Whaup o' the rede: a ballad of the border raiders'' (1909), ''[[Kirkhope Tower]]'' (1913), and ''Ho! for the blades of Harden''.\n\nThe names of the [[Reiver]] families are still very much apparent amongst the inhabitants of the [[Scottish Borders]], Northumberland and [[Cumbria]] today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as 'annual re-runs of the bloody [[Battle of Otterburn]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.\n\n[[Hawick]] in Scotland holds an annual Reivers' festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of [[Duns]] is headed by the \"Reiver\" and \"Reiver's Lass\", a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency's first two leaflets from the 'Scots Legacy' series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.\n\nBorderers (particularly those banished by [[James VI of Scotland]]) took part in the [[plantation of Ulster]] becoming the people known as [[Ulster-Scots]] ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster with names such as Elliot, Armstrong, Beattie, Bell, Carruthers, Hume and Heron, Rutledge, and Turnbulls amongst others.\n\nBorder surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of [[Scots-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] settlement in the United States, and particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the [[Upland South]]. Author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, [[Neil Armstrong]], was the first person to set foot on the moon. In 1972 Armstrong was made a [[Freedom of the city|freeman]] of the town of [[Langholm]] in Scotland, the home of his ancestors.\n\nThe artist [[Gordon Young (artist)|Gordon Young]] created a public art work in Carlisle: ''Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement'', a nod to [[Gavin Dunbar (archbishop of Glasgow)|Gavin Dunbar]], the Archbishop of Glasgow's 1525 ''Monition of Cursing''.  Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects [[Tullie House Museum]] to [[Carlisle Castle]] under a main road, and part of the bishop's curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|title=Cursing Stone & Reiver Pavement / Carlisle, 2001|publisher=Gordon Young|accessdate=23 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227133140/http://gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Debatable Lands]]\n* [[History of Northumberland]]\n* ''[[The Borderers]]'' (Television series)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Carey|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth|title=The Stirring World of Robert Carey, Robert Carey's Memoirs 1577\u20131625|publisher=RippingYarns.com|isbn=1-904466-29-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Durham|first=Keith|author2=McBride, Angus|title=The Border Reivers: The story of the Anglo-Scottish borderlands|year=1995|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-85532-417-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781855324176}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Garth|title=War Stories: Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Vertigo|isbn=1-4012-1039-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York}}\n* {{cite book|last=Howker|first=Janni|authorlink=Janni Howker|title=Martin Farrell|year=1997|publisher=Red Fox|isbn=978-0-09-918161-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=MacDonald Fraser|first=George|authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser|title=The Steel Bonnets|year=1971|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-272746-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moffat|first=Alistair|title=The Reivers|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-674-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Rob|title=The Border Reivers: A stain on the image of Tudor England|publisher=[[Medieval History Magazine]]|volume=4|date=December 2003}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moss|first=Tom|title=Deadlock and Deliverance: The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong|year=2007|publisher=Rose Cottage Publications|isbn=978-0-9558016-0-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tait|first=Jon|title=Dick the Devil's Bairns: Breaking the Border Mafia|year=2018|publisher=Tredition|isbn=978-3-7482-2361-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.borderreivers.co.uk The Border Reivers Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090126155155/http://nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm The Border Reivers]\n* [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/ Border Reivers DNA Project]\n* [http://the-border-reivers.co.uk Yet Another Border Reivers Website]\n* [http://www.everymansprey.com The Routledge Reivers]\n* [http://www.reivershistory.co.uk The Capture and Rescue of Kinmont Willie Armstrong]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074111/http://www.go-britain.com/html/borders_map.htm#borders Borders Map with surnames]\n\n{{Scottish clans}}\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Scottish border]]\n[[Category:History of Europe]]\n[[Category:Border Reivers| ]]\n[[Category:Cavalry]]\n[[Category:History of Cumberland]]\n[[Category:History of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:History of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Military history of Northumberland]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:History of the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Tudor England]]\n", "name_user": "Graham87", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDwellings and fortifications:fix precision", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_reivers"}

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\nParagraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:\n{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}\n\nLater, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL \u2013 UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\n==== U.N. map of ceasefire line ====\nTitle of [[U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2 which illustrates the CFL as per the Karachi Agreement reads:\n\n<blockquote>Map of the State of Jammu and Kashmir showing the Cease Fire Line as Agreed Upon in the Karachi Agreement, Ratified by the Governments of India and Pakistan on 29 and 30 July Respectively.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\nParagraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:\n{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}\n\nLater, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL \u2013 UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\n==== U.N. map of ceasefire line ====\nTitle of [[U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2 which illustrates the CFL as per the Karachi Agreement reads:\n\n<blockquote>Map of the State of Jammu and Kashmir showing the Cease Fire Line as Agreed Upon in the Karachi Agreement, Ratified by the Governments of India and Pakistan on 29 and 30 July Respectively.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The film started life as a part of a 90-minute TV special for [[CBS]], entitled '''''Orson's Bag''''', consisting of Welles' 40-minute condensation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|The Merchant of Venice]]'', and assorted sketches around Europe. This was abandoned in 1969 when CBS withdrew their funding over Welles' long-running disputes with US authorities regarding his tax status, he continued to fashion the footage in his own style.\n\nThe film features contributions from British comedians [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Graeme Garden]], and [[Bill Oddie]], before the trio became known as [[The Goodies]].\n\n==Segments==\nThe film consists of five segments, all of them comic: ''Churchill'', ''Swinging London'', ''Four Clubmen'', ''Stately Homes'' and  ''Tailors''.\n\n===1. Churchill===\nThe first segment is filmed entirely in silhouette. Welles plays [[Winston Churchill]] fielding press questions and then exchanging ''bons mots'' with [[Nancy Astor]] ([[Oja Kodar]]). Each line spoken by Churchill is a well-known witticism commonly attributed to him. [[Graeme Garden]] provides narration.\n\n===2. Swinging London===\nThe longest segment of the film (9 mins) has a bowler-hatted reporter ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) wandering through \"[[Swinging London]]\", searching for [[Carnaby Street]] with limited success. Most of the supporting roles are played by Welles in a variety of disguises: a British policeman, an old lady selling [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|\"dirty postcards\"]], a Chinaman luring customers into a [[strip club]], and the omnipresent [[one-man band]]. The song \"One Man Band\" was written by [[Bill Oddie]] (who had joined Brooke-Taylor and Garden for the second season of the TV sketch series ''Broaden Your Mind''). Garden appears briefly as a rude workman and as a [[Morris dancer]]. This segment is noteworthy for what reviewers have called its \"[[Monty Python|Python]]esque\" style<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/02/02/WEEKEND2814.dtl|title=The elder Welles: A waste of talent?|website=Sfgate.com|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> - which is significant as it was filmed before ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' first aired in October 1969. A shortened, not restored version of ''Swinging London'' appeared in the documentary ''Orson Welles: One-Man Band'' on the 2005 [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] DVD of ''[[F for Fake]]''.\n\n===3. Four Clubmen===\nApart from Welles' introduction, the soundtrack has been lost for this segment. It is set in a [[gentlemen's club (traditional)|London club]] in which Welles plays four different members, all under heavy make-up, plus a noisy waiter who drops things.\n\n===4. Stately Homes, a.k.a. Lord Plumfield versus Welles===\nThis segment features Welles as a journalist wandering around the stately home of Lord Plumfield. Welles also plays the eccentric, penniless Plumfield; [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] has a cameo as Plumfield's moronic son; and [[Graeme Garden]] plays Plumfield's feeble butler \"Blemish\" who does chicken impressions. (Plumfield says, \"I'd give him the sack except we need the eggs.\") Garden also provides some narration.\n\n===5. Tailors===\nWelles plays a shy American tourist being measured by two rude English tailors ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]]) who are dismissive of his ignorance of tailoring, and keep mocking his weight.\n\n==Production==\n\nIn 1969, Orson Welles was in London and got in touch with writer/performers [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Graeme Garden]]. Brooke-Taylor recalled, \n\n{{cquote|Graeme Garden and I made two series of a sketch show called ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' in 1968 and '69. We were watching the first programme of the second series in Graeme's flat. As it ended Graeme's phone rang.

He'd seen some of the first series and got our phone numbers.

The 1971 sequences are noticeable because Welles had grown a long beard by then, whereas he was clean-shaven in all the parts he played in 1968-9. The film was left unfinished in Welles' lifetime.\n\nAfter Welles' death in 1985, all of his unfinished films were bequeathed to his long-term companion and mistress [[Oja Kodar]], and she in turn donated many of them (including ''One Man Band'') to the [[Munich Film Museum]] for preservation and restoration. In 1999 the Munich Film Museum then edited together the complete footage into a 29-minute cut, which has subsequently been screened at numerous film festivals.\n\nThe full restored footage has never been released on video or DVD, although an unrestored print is used in Vassili Slovic's 1995 documentary ''Orson Welles: the One Man Band'', which includes the segments ''Churchill'', ''Stately Homes'' and ''Tailors'' in their entirety, as well as clips from ''Four Clubmen'' and ''One Man Band''.\n\nThe non-London sketch segments of ''Orson's Bag'' were edited by the Munich Film Museum into the 9 minute short ''[[Vienna (film)|Vienna]]''.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Orson Welles]] as Presenter / [[Winston Churchill]] / [[One-man band]] / Policeman / [[Morris dancer]] / Old lady / Chinaman / Four clubmen /  Journalist / Lord Plumfield / American tourist\n*[[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] as Reporter / Young aristocrat\n*[[Graeme Garden]] as \"Churchill\" narrator / Butler / Morris Dancer\n*[[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as Tailor\n*[[Jonathan Lynn]] as Tailor's Assistant / Waiter \n*[[Oja Kodar]] as [[Nancy Astor]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|title=London|id=0289993}}\n* [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/731754 ''Orson Welles' London''] on [[British Film Institute]]\n\n{{Orson Welles}}\n\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Short films directed by Orson Welles]]\n[[Category:1971 short films]]\n[[Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = One Man Band<br>a.k.a.
