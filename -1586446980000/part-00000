Originally a [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city, [[Scupi]] became the capital of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] in the second century BC. On the eve of the 1st century AD, the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&pg=PA129&dq=scupi%20dardania%20roman#v=onepage&q=scupi%20dardania%20roman&f=false|title=The Provincial at Rome: And, Rome and the Balkans 80BC-AD14|last2=Birley|first2=Anthony|date=1 January 1999|publisher=University of Exeter Press|first1=Ronald|last1=Syme|via=Google Books|isbn=9780859896320}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=scupi%20dardania%20roman#v=onepage&q=scupi%20&f=false|title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia: A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire|last=M\u00f3csy|first=Andr\u00e1s|date=1 January 1974|publisher=Routledge & K.

During much of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, the town was contested between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], whose capital it was between 972 and 992.\n\nFrom 1282, the town was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371. In 1392, Skopje was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]]s who called it ''\u00dcsk\u00fcb'', with this name also being in use in English for a time. The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years, serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp and later the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1912, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] during the [[Balkan Wars]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&pg=PA40&dq=serbia++annexed++1912&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=oDX8UJnLDovE4gSwnIHgDg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=serbia%20%20annexed%20%201912&f=false 40]}} During the First World War the city was seized by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and after this war, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] becoming the capital of the [[Vardarska banovina]]. In the Second World War the city was again captured by Bulgaria and in 1944 became the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], then a [[federated state]] of [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The city developed rapidly, but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a [[1963 Skopje earthquake|disastrous earthquake]].\n\nSkopje is located on the upper course of the [[Vardar|Vardar River]], and is located on a major north-south [[Balkans|Balkan]] route between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]]. It is a center for metal-processing, chemical, timber, textile, leather, and printing industries. Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade, logistics, and banking sectors, as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation, culture and sport. According to the last official count from 2002, Skopje had a population of 506,926 inhabitants; according to official estimates, the city had a population of 544,086 inhabitants, as of 30 June 2015, meaning slightly more than a quarter of all North Macedonia's population lives in the city and its immediate surrounding area.<ref>http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/2.4.16.10.pdf</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nSkopje is located in the north of the country, in the center of the [[Balkan peninsula]], and halfway between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]].

The summers are long, hot and relatively dry with low humidity. Skopje's average July high is {{convert|31|\u00b0C|0}}. On average Skopje sees 88 days above {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0}} each year, and 10.2 days above {{convert|35.0|\u00b0C|0}} every year. Winters are short, relatively cold and wet. Snowfalls are common in the winter period, but heavy snow accumulation is rare and the snowcover lasts only for a few hours or a few days if heavy. In summer, temperatures are usually above {{convert|31|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and sometimes above {{convert|40|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. In spring and autumn, the temperatures range from {{convert|15|to|24|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. In winter, the day temperatures are roughly in the range from {{convert|5-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, but at nights they often fall below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and sometimes below {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Typically, temperatures throughout one year range from \u221213&nbsp;\u00b0C to 39&nbsp;\u00b0C.

However, it is threatened by the intensification of agriculture and the urban extension. The largest protected area within the city limits is Mount Vodno, which is a popular leisure destination. A cable car connects its peak to the downtown, and many pedestrian paths run through its woods. Other large natural spots include the [[Matka Canyon]].<ref name=\"nature\"/>\n\nThe city itself comprises several parks and gardens amounting to 4,361 hectares. Among these are the City Park (Gradski Park), built by the Ottoman Turks at the beginning of the 20th century; \u017dena Borec Park, located in front of the Parliament; the University arboretum; and Gazi Baba forest. Many streets and boulevards are planted with trees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkovi.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=585010091E61F94A93252F30545D68B9|title=\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e|publisher=\u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e|accessdate=19 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115085154/http://www.parkovi.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=585010091E61F94A93252F30545D68B9|archivedate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nSkopje experiences many environmental issues which are often overshadowed by the economic poverty of the country.

Concentrations of certain types of [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM2 and PM10) are regularly over twelve times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommended maximum levels. In winter, smoke regularly obscures vision and can lead to problems for drivers.

Central heating is often not affordable, and so households often burn firewood, as well as used car tyres, various plastic garbage, [[petroleum]] and other possible flammable waste, which emits toxic chemicals harmful to the population, especially to children and the elderly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/skopje-europe-polluted-capital-city-190312092012504.html|title=Inside Skopje, the Europe's most polluted capital city|last=Lee and Mickute|first=Joi and Viktorija|date=19 March 2019|website=Al Jazeera|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe city's smog has reduced its air quality and affected the health of many of its citizens, many of which have died from pollution-related illnesses. \n\nAn [[Application software|application]] called ''MojVozduh'' ('My Air') has been launched to help citizens track pollution levels.

It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. \u0160uto Orizari, located on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with [[Romani language|Romani]] as its local official language.

After the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], power was centralised and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: [[Gjor\u010de Petrov municipality|Gjor\u010de Petrov]] and [[\u0160uto Orizari municipality|\u0160uto Orizari]]. After the [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces]] in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate [[Saraj municipality]] into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom Municipality]] separated itself from Kisela Voda, and [[Butel municipality]] from \u010cair.<ref name=\"local\"/>\n\nMunicipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years.

Architecture of that time is very similar to the one of [[Central Europe]], but some buildings are more creative, such as the [[Moorish Revival architecture|Neo-Moorish]] Arab House and the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] train station, both built in 1938.<ref name=\"colophon\"/> [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]] appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by [[Milan Zlokovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"colophon\"/> However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese [[Kenzo Tange]] who designed the new train station.<ref name=\"colophon\"/> Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: [[Georgi Konstantinovski]] designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Del\u010dev in 1975, while [[Janko Konstantinov]] designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974\u20131989).

Originally a [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city, [[Scupi]] became the capital of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] in the second century BC. On the eve of the 1st century AD, the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&pg=PA129&dq=scupi%20dardania%20roman#v=onepage&q=scupi%20dardania%20roman&f=false|title=The Provincial at Rome: And, Rome and the Balkans 80BC-AD14|last2=Birley|first2=Anthony|date=1 January 1999|publisher=University of Exeter Press|first1=Ronald|last1=Syme|via=Google Books|isbn=9780859896320}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=scupi%20dardania%20roman#v=onepage&q=scupi%20&f=false|title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia: A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire|last=M\u00f3csy|first=Andr\u00e1s|date=1 January 1974|publisher=Routledge & K.

During much of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, the town was contested between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], whose capital it was between 972 and 992.\n\nFrom 1282, the town was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371. In 1392, Skopje was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]]s who called it ''\u00dcsk\u00fcb'', with this name also being in use in English for a time. The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years, serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp and later the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1912, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] during the [[Balkan Wars]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&pg=PA40&dq=serbia++annexed++1912&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=oDX8UJnLDovE4gSwnIHgDg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=serbia%20%20annexed%20%201912&f=false 40]}} During the First World War the city was seized by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and after this war, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] becoming the capital of the [[Vardarska banovina]]. In the Second World War the city was again captured by Bulgaria and in 1944 became the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], then a [[federated state]] of [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The city developed rapidly, but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a [[1963 Skopje earthquake|disastrous earthquake]].\n\nSkopje is located on the upper course of the [[Vardar|Vardar River]], and is located on a major north-south [[Balkans|Balkan]] route between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]]. It is a center for metal-processing, chemical, timber, textile, leather, and printing industries. Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade, logistics, and banking sectors, as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation, culture and sport. According to the last official count from 2002, Skopje had a population of 506,926 inhabitants; according to official estimates, the city had a population of 544,086 inhabitants, as of 30 June 2015, meaning slightly more than a quarter of all North Macedonia's population lives in the city and its immediate surrounding area.<ref>http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/2.4.16.10.pdf</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nSkopje is located in the north of the country, in the center of the [[Balkan peninsula]], and halfway between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]].

After the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], power was centralised and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: [[Gjor\u010de Petrov municipality|Gjor\u010de Petrov]] and [[\u0160uto Orizari municipality|\u0160uto Orizari]]. After the [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces]] in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate [[Saraj municipality]] into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom Municipality]] separated itself from Kisela Voda, and [[Butel municipality]] from \u010cair.<ref name=\"local\"/>\n\nMunicipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years.

Architecture of that time is very similar to the one of [[Central Europe]], but some buildings are more creative, such as the [[Moorish Revival architecture|Neo-Moorish]] Arab House and the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] train station, both built in 1938.<ref name=\"colophon\"/> [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]] appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by [[Milan Zlokovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"colophon\"/> However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake.
