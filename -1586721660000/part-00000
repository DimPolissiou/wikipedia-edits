Henrique|GCIH]], [[Order of Public Instruction (Portugal)|GCIP]]}} (born 25 June 1933), is a Portuguese [[architect]], and [[architectural educator]]. He is internationally known as '''\u00c1lvaro Siza''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8a\u026bv\u0250\u027eu \u02c8siz\u0250}}) and in Portugal as '''Siza Vieira''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8siz\u0250 \u02c8vjej\u027e\u0250}}).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSiza was born in [[Matosinhos]], a small coastal town near [[Porto]].  He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the [[University of Porto]], the current [[Porto School of Architecture|FAUP]] &ndash; ''Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto''. \n\n==Career==\nSiza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with [[Fernando T\u00e1vora]], he soon became one of the references of the [[Porto School of Architecture]] where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], e.g. on Portugal's [[Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98|flagship pavilions]] at [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon and [[Expo 2000]] in Hannover, as well as on the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Pavillon]] 2005.

Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/arts/a-portuguese-wins-pritzker-award.html |title= A Portuguese Wins Pritzker Award |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= 27 April 1992}}</ref> In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of [[\u00c9vora]] commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town.

Henrique|GCIH]], [[Order of Public Instruction (Portugal)|GCIP]]}} (born 25 June 1933), is a Portuguese [[architect]], and [[architectural educator]]. He is internationally known as '''\u00c1lvaro Siza''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8a\u026bv\u0250\u027eu \u02c8siz\u0250}}) and in Portugal as '''Siza Vieira''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8siz\u0250 \u02c8vjej\u027e\u0250}}).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSiza was born in [[Matosinhos]], a small coastal town near [[Porto]].  He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the [[University of Porto]], the current [[Porto School of Architecture|FAUP]] &ndash; ''Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto''. \n\n==Career==\nSiza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with [[Fernando T\u00e1vora]], he soon became one of the references of the [[Porto School of Architecture]] where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], e.g. on Portugal's [[Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98|flagship pavilions]] at [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon and [[Expo 2000]] in Hannover, as well as on the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Pavillon]] 2005. Siza's work is often described as \"poetic [[modernism]]\";<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/08/alvaro.siza.riba.prize Jonathan Glancey: ''A Gold Medal for Siza? About time''] in ''The Guardian'', 8 October 2008</ref> he himself has contributed to publications on [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]].\n\nAmong Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named [[Piscinas de Mar\u00e9s]]) he created in the 1960s for Le\u00e7a da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/arts/a-portuguese-wins-pritzker-award.html |title= A Portuguese Wins Pritzker Award |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= 27 April 1992}}</ref> In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of [[\u00c9vora]] commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (''Servi\u00e7o de Apoio Ambulat\u00f3rio Local''), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards.<ref name=\"Pritzker\"/> He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.\n\nMost of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the [[FAUP|Faculty of Architecture]] (1987\u201393), and the [[Serralves Foundation|Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art]] (1997).

A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Popular among London theatregoers, the play was frequently revived during Christmas season over the next four decades.]]\n\nThe first full major production of 'Alice' books during Carroll's lifetime was ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', an 1886 [[musical theatre|musical play]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] by H. Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling.

Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M.

[[Julia Belle Swain]] |format=[[ogg]]}}\nA '''calliope''' (see [[#Pronunciation|below]] for pronunciation) is a [[musical instrument]] that produces sound by sending a gas, originally [[steam]] or, more recently, [[compressed air]], through large [[whistle]]s\u2014originally locomotive whistles.\n\nA calliope is typically very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There is no way to vary [[timbre (music)|tone]] or [[dynamics (music)|loudness]]. Musically, the only [[musical expression|expression]] possible is the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], and [[duration (music)|duration]] of the notes.\n\nThe steam calliope is also known as a '''steam [[Pipe organ|organ]]''' or '''steam piano'''. The air-driven calliope is sometimes called a '''calliaphone''', the name given to it by [[Norman Baker (inventor)|Norman Baker]], but the \"Calliaphone\" name is registered by the Miner Company for instruments produced under the Tangley name.\n\nIn the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|age of steam]], the steam calliope was particularly used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was readily available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive [[carousel]]s, or supplied with steam from a [[traction engine]]. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but the presence of other steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.\n\nCalliopes can be played by a player at a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] or mechanically. Mechanical operation may be by a drum similar to a [[music box]] drum, or by a [[Piano roll|roll]] similar to that of a [[player piano]]. Some instruments have both a keyboard and a mechanism for automated operation, others only one or the other.  Some calliopes can also be played via a [[MIDI]] interface.\n\nThe whistles of a calliope are tuned to a [[chromatic scale]], although this process is difficult and must be repeated often to maintain quality sound.  Since the pitch of each note is largely affected by the temperature of the steam, accurate tuning is nearly impossible; however, the off-pitch notes (particularly in the upper register) have become something of a trademark of the steam calliope.  A calliope may have anywhere from 25 to 67 whistles, but 32 is traditional for a steam calliope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/music/musichistory/natchezcalliope.html |title=The Steam Calliope on Steamboat Natchez |publisher=Neworleansonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Calliope on the Minnie-Ha-Ha.jpg|thumb|right|Calliope on the Minne-Ha-Ha, a [[paddle steamer|stern-wheeler]] on Lake George, NY]]\n[[Image:Kitch Greenhouses Calliope.jpg|thumb|right|Kitch Greenhouse Steam Calliope at the Ohio Historical Society \u2013 July, 2006]]\n[[Image:SteamTractorCarnival18Feb2007Rubensteins.jpg|thumb|right|Fairground calliope trailer being hauled by a U.S.-built [[traction engine]] \u2013 New Orleans Mardi Gras 2007]]\n[[File:Kratz Steam Calliope.jpg|thumbnail|Steam calliope (c. 1901) built by George Kratz and used on the showboat French's ''New Sensation'' at The [[Mariners' Museum]]]]\n\n[[Joshua C.

In 1851, William Hoyt of Dupont, Indiana claimed to have conceived of a device similar to Stoddard's calliope, but he never patented it. Later, an employee of Stoddard's American Music, Arthur S. Denny, attempted to market an \"Improved Kalliope\" in Europe, but it did not catch on. In 1859, he demonstrated this instrument in [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], London. Unlike other calliopes before or since, Denny's Improved Kalliope let the player control the steam pressure, and therefore the volume of the music, while playing.\n\nWhile Stoddard originally intended the calliope to replace bells at churches, it found its way onto riverboats during the [[Paddle steamer|paddlewheel]] era. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the ''[[Delta Queen]]'', the ''Belle of Louisville'', and ''[[President (1924 steamboat)|President]]''. Their calliopes are played regularly on river excursions. Many surviving calliopes were built by '''Thomas J. Nichol''', [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], who built calliopes from 1890 until 1932. The Thomas J. Nichol calliopes featured rolled sheet copper (as used in roofing) for the resonant tube (the bell) of the whistle, lending a sweeter tone than cast bronze or brass, which were the usual materials for steam whistles of the day. David Morecraft pioneered a resurgence in the building of authentic steam calliopes of the Thomas J. Nichol style beginning in 1985 in [[Peru, Indiana]]. These calliopes are featured in Peru's annual Circus City Parade.  Morecraft died on December 5, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahlinger |first1=Fred |title=Passing of Dave Morecraft, Steam Calliope Builder |url=https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/201612/2016.12.06.01.html |website=Mechanical Music Archives |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nStoddard's original calliope was attached to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork [[music box]]. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles.  Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.\n\nStarting in the 1900s, calliopes began using [[music roll]]s instead of a live musician. The music roll operated in a similar manner to a [[piano roll]] in a [[player piano]], mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.\n\nMost calliopes disappeared in the mid-20th century, as steam power was replaced with other power sources. Without the demand for technicians that mines and railroads supplied, no support was available to keep boilers running. Only a few calliopes have survived, and these are rarely played.\n\n=={{anchor|Pronunciation}}Pronunciation==\n\nThe pronunciation of the word has long been disputed, and often it is pronounced differently inside and outside the groups that use it. The [[Calliope|Greek muse]] by the same name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|\u02c8|l|a\u026a|\u0259|p|i}} {{respell|k\u0259|LY|\u0259|pee}}, but the instrument was usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|l|i|o\u028a|p}} {{respell|KAL|ee|ohp}} by people who played it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} A nineteenth century magazine, ''[[Reedy's Mirror]]'', attempted to settle the dispute by publishing this rhyme:<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Guillaum\n  | first =Ted\n  | title =MQ Calliope Press Release-Part 2\n  | date = 2003-01-18\n  | url =http://www.steamboats.org/talkshop/messages/2175.html\n  | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref>\n{{poemquote|Proud folk stare after me,\nCall me Calliope;\nTooting joy, tooting hope,\nI am the calliope.}}\n\nThis, in turn, came from a poem by [[Vachel Lindsay]], called \"The Kallyope {{sic}} Yell\",<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =The Kallyope Yell\n  | date = 2003-01-18\n  | url =http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/amv13_3.html\n  | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref>\nin which Lindsay uses both pronunciations.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lehmann\n |first       = Gary\n |title       = Vachel Lindsay: A Madman Who Burst His Rivets on a Head of Steam\n |date        = Fall 2005\n |url         = http://www.jmww.150m.com/Lindsay.html\n |accessdate  = 2007-02-20\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515073540/http://www.jmww.150m.com/Lindsay.html\n |archivedate = 2007-05-15\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the song \"[[Blinded by the Light]]\", written in 1972, [[Bruce Springsteen]] used the four-syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|\u02c8|l|a\u026a|\u0259|p|i}}) pronunciation when referring to a fairground organ, and this was repeated by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] in their 1976 [[Cover version|cover]].\n\n==Related instruments==\n\n===Pyrophone===\nThe calliope is similar to the [[pyrophone]]. The difference between the two is that the calliope is an external combustion instrument and the pyrophone is an internal combustion instrument.\n\nAt 1998's [[Burning Man]], a pyrophone referred to as ''Satan's Calliope'' was powered by ignition of propane inside resonant cavities.  This device was incorrectly referred to as a \"calliope\", since a calliope is an external combustion instrument.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hell's Bells: An engineer's devilish art car produces great balls of fire at Burning Man|author=Sarah Phelan|work= Metroactive|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/08.22.01/burningman-0134.html}}</ref>\n\n===Calliaphone===\nThe Calliaphone is an invention of [[Norman G.

Kastner installed several such instruments in Paris.\n\n==Popular culture==\n[[The Beatles]], in recording \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" from the album ''[[Sgt.

John had said that he wanted to 'smell the sawdust on the floor', wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus.  I said to him, 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.{{'\"}} Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]] marches. \"[I] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had [[Geoff Emerick]] throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last=Lewisohn\n| first=Mark\n| year=1988\n| authorlink=Mark Lewisohn\n| title=The Beatles Recording Sessions\n| publisher=[[Harmony Books]]\n| location=New York\n| isbn=0-517-57066-1\n| ref=harv\n}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[The Tears of a Clown]]\" from [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]], first released in 1967 and whose music was composed by [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Henry Cosby|Hank Cosby]], features a distinctive circus calliope motif, which inspired Smokey Robinson with the lyrical theme of the sad clown.\n\nThe [[art rock]]ers of the [[The United States of America (band)|United States of America]] used the instrument on several tracks of their [[The United States of America (album)|eponymous]] 1968 album (recorded 1967).\n\nAmerican rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] used a calliope on their song 'Flaming Youth' from their 1976 album Destroyer.\n\n[[Tom Waits]]' 2002 release ''[[Blood Money (Tom Waits album)|Blood Money]]'' features a track written for trumpet and calliope.\n\n[[Vernian Process]]' 2011 single \"[[Something Wicked (That Way Went)]]\" features a sampled calliope throughout.\n\nIn the ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' episode \"Percy and the Calliope\", [[Percy the Small Engine]] saves a calliope from the [[wrecking yard|scrapyard]].<ref name=\"Youtube upload of the episode.\">{{cite web|title=Percy and the Calliope \u2013 UK |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjT7Bz0icSM |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707052453/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjT7Bz0icSM |archivedate=July 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' by King Crimson, the main theme of the title song is played on a calliope towards the end of the piece.\n\nDuring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[The Girlie Show World Tour|The Girlie Show]] tour, during the encore for \"Holiday\", the credits include the statement, \"contains excerpts from ''Holiday for Calliope'',\" which was, in general, the hook for \"Holiday\" played with a calliope. Additionally, a generalized circus theme was played with a calliope sound through part of the song.\n\nIn the web series ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'', there is a theoretical system (similar to [[string theory]]) humorously dubbed the \"Space Time Calliope\" in which an infinite number of universes and timelines exist. The name is possibly referencing the mechanical complexity of calliopes.\n\nThe [[Bruce Springsteen]] song more popularly covered by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] \"[[Blinded by the Light]]\" contains the line \"the calliope crashed to the ground\".\n\nThe [[Barclay James Harvest]] song \"Medicine Man\" uses the lyric \"And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope to call the tune\". This song was a great concert favourite and concerned a sinister travelling fair and carousel.\n\nAt one point in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"Free Samples\", SpongeBob uses a calliope to lure potential customers to his free samples stand.

Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but the presence of other steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.\n\nCalliopes can be played by a player at a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] or mechanically. Mechanical operation may be by a drum similar to a [[music box]] drum, or by a [[Piano roll|roll]] similar to that of a [[player piano]]. Some instruments have both a keyboard and a mechanism for automated operation, others only one or the other.  Some calliopes can also be played via a [[MIDI]] interface.\n\nThe whistles of a calliope are tuned to a [[chromatic scale]], although this process is difficult and must be repeated often to maintain quality sound.  Since the pitch of each note is largely affected by the temperature of the steam, accurate tuning is nearly impossible; however, the off-pitch notes (particularly in the upper register) have become something of a trademark of the steam calliope.  A calliope may have anywhere from 25 to 67 whistles, but 32 is traditional for a steam calliope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/music/musichistory/natchezcalliope.html |title=The Steam Calliope on Steamboat Natchez |publisher=Neworleansonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Calliope on the Minnie-Ha-Ha.jpg|thumb|right|Calliope on the Minne-Ha-Ha, a [[paddle steamer|stern-wheeler]] on Lake George, NY]]\n[[Image:Kitch Greenhouses Calliope.jpg|thumb|right|Kitch Greenhouse Steam Calliope at the Ohio Historical Society \u2013 July, 2006]]\n[[Image:SteamTractorCarnival18Feb2007Rubensteins.jpg|thumb|right|Fairground calliope trailer being hauled by a U.S.-built [[traction engine]] \u2013 New Orleans Mardi Gras 2007]]\n[[File:Kratz Steam Calliope.jpg|thumbnail|Steam calliope (c. 1901) built by George Kratz and used on the showboat French's ''New Sensation'' at The [[Mariners' Museum]]]]\n\n[[Joshua C.

In 1851, William Hoyt of Dupont, Indiana claimed to have conceived of a device similar to Stoddard's calliope, but he never patented it. Later, an employee of Stoddard's American Music, Arthur S. Denny, attempted to market an \"Improved Kalliope\" in Europe, but it did not catch on. In 1859, he demonstrated this instrument in [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], London. Unlike other calliopes before or since, Denny's Improved Kalliope let the player control the steam pressure, and therefore the volume of the music, while playing.\n\nWhile Stoddard originally intended the calliope to replace bells at churches, it found its way onto riverboats during the [[Paddle steamer|paddlewheel]] era. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the ''[[Delta Queen]]'', the ''Belle of Louisville'', and ''[[President (1924 steamboat)|President]]''. Their calliopes are played regularly on river excursions. Many surviving calliopes were built by '''Thomas J. Nichol''', [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], who built calliopes from 1890 until 1932. The Thomas J. Nichol calliopes featured rolled sheet copper (as used in roofing) for the resonant tube (the bell) of the whistle, lending a sweeter tone than cast bronze or brass, which were the usual materials for steam whistles of the day. David Morecraft pioneered a resurgence in the building of authentic steam calliopes of the Thomas J. Nichol style beginning in 1985 in [[Peru, Indiana]]. These calliopes are featured in Peru's annual Circus City Parade.  Morecraft died on December 5, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahlinger |first1=Fred |title=Passing of Dave Morecraft, Steam Calliope Builder |url=https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/201612/2016.12.06.01.html |website=Mechanical Music Archives |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nStoddard's original calliope was attached to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork [[music box]]. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles.  Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.\n\nStarting in the 1900s, calliopes began using [[music roll]]s instead of a live musician. The music roll operated in a similar manner to a [[piano roll]] in a [[player piano]], mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.\n\nMost calliopes disappeared in the mid-20th century, as steam power was replaced with other power sources. Without the demand for technicians that mines and railroads supplied, no support was available to keep boilers running. Only a few calliopes have survived, and these are rarely played.\n\n=={{anchor|Pronunciation}}Pronunciation==\n\nThe pronunciation of the word has long been disputed, and often it is pronounced differently inside and outside the groups that use it.

The difference between the two is that the calliope is an external combustion instrument and the pyrophone is an internal combustion instrument.\n\nAt 1998's [[Burning Man]], a pyrophone referred to as ''Satan's Calliope'' was powered by ignition of propane inside resonant cavities.  This device was incorrectly referred to as a \"calliope\", since a calliope is an external combustion instrument.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hell's Bells: An engineer's devilish art car produces great balls of fire at Burning Man|author=Sarah Phelan|work= Metroactive|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/08.22.01/burningman-0134.html}}</ref>\n\n===Calliaphone===\nThe Calliaphone is an invention of [[Norman G.

Kastner installed several such instruments in Paris.\n\n==Popular culture==\n[[The Beatles]], in recording \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" from the album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]],'' used tapes of calliope music to create the atmosphere of a circus. Beatles producer [[George Martin]] recalled, \"When we first worked on 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' John had said that he wanted to 'smell the sawdust on the floor', wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus.  I said to him, 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.{{'\"}} Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]] marches. \"[I] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had [[Geoff Emerick]] throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last=Lewisohn\n| first=Mark\n| year=1988\n| authorlink=Mark Lewisohn\n| title=The Beatles Recording Sessions\n| publisher=[[Harmony Books]]\n| location=New York\n| isbn=0-517-57066-1\n| ref=harv\n}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[The Tears of a Clown]]\" from [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]], first released in 1967 and whose music was composed by [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Henry Cosby|Hank Cosby]], features a distinctive circus calliope motif, which inspired Smokey Robinson with the lyrical theme of the sad clown.\n\nThe [[art rock]]ers of the [[The United States of America (band)|United States of America]] used the instrument on several tracks of their [[The United States of America (album)|eponymous]] 1968 album (recorded 1967).\n\nAmerican rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] used a calliope on their song 'Flaming Youth' from their 1976 album Destroyer.\n\n[[Tom Waits]]' 2002 release ''[[Blood Money (Tom Waits album)|Blood Money]]'' features a track written for trumpet and calliope.\n\n[[Vernian Process]]' 2011 single \"[[Something Wicked (That Way Went)]]\" features a sampled calliope throughout.\n\nIn the ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' episode \"Percy and the Calliope\", [[Percy the Small Engine]] saves a calliope from the [[wrecking yard|scrapyard]].<ref name=\"Youtube upload of the episode.\">{{cite web|title=Percy and the Calliope \u2013 UK |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjT7Bz0icSM |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707052453/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjT7Bz0icSM |archivedate=July 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' by King Crimson, the main theme of the title song is played on a calliope towards the end of the piece.\n\nDuring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[The Girlie Show World Tour|The Girlie Show]] tour, during the encore for \"Holiday\", the credits include the statement, \"contains excerpts from ''Holiday for Calliope'',\" which was, in general, the hook for \"Holiday\" played with a calliope. Additionally, a generalized circus theme was played with a calliope sound through part of the song.\n\nIn the web series ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'', there is a theoretical system (similar to [[string theory]]) humorously dubbed the \"Space Time Calliope\" in which an infinite number of universes and timelines exist. The name is possibly referencing the mechanical complexity of calliopes.\n\nThe [[Bruce Springsteen]] song more popularly covered by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] \"[[Blinded by the Light]]\" contains the line \"the calliope crashed to the ground\".\n\nThe [[Barclay James Harvest]] song \"Medicine Man\" uses the lyric \"And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope to call the tune\". This song was a great concert favourite and concerned a sinister travelling fair and carousel.\n\nAt one point in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"Free Samples\", SpongeBob uses a calliope to lure potential customers to his free samples stand.

Under the terms of the [[One China Policy]] stipulated by the PRC, such countries may not have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, as the PRC denies the status of ROC as a [[sovereign state]] and claims Taiwan as part of its territory. As a result, these countries do not allow the ROC to establish an \"official\" embassy or consulate but instead allow the ROC to establish these representative offices to conduct unofficial government relations with the host countries.\n\nExcept in the United States and Japan, these establishments use the term \"[[Taipei]]\" instead of \"[[Taiwan]]\", \"ROC\" or even the term \"Nationalist China\" (named after the ruling party [[Kuomintang]]) since the term \"Taipei\" avoids implying that Taiwan is a different country on a par with the PRC or that there are \"[[Two Chinas]]\", the PRC and the ROC, both of which would cause difficulties for their host countries.{{citation needed|reason=This whole paragraph needs a citation.|date=May 2018}}\n\nTECROs state that their aim is \"to promote bilateral trade, investment, culture, science and technology exchanges and cooperation, as well as better understanding\", although they perform many of the same functions as an [[embassy]] or [[consulate general]], such as issuing visas and [[Republic of China passport|passports]].

Under the terms of the [[One China Policy]] stipulated by the PRC, such countries may not have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, as the PRC denies the status of ROC as a [[sovereign state]] and claims Taiwan as part of its territory. As a result, these countries do not allow the ROC to establish an \"official\" embassy or consulate but instead allow the ROC to establish these representative offices to conduct unofficial government relations with the host countries.\n\nExcept in the United States and Japan, these establishments use the term \"[[Taipei]]\" instead of \"[[Taiwan]]\", \"ROC\" or even the term \"Nationalist China\" (named after the ruling party [[Kuomintang]]) since the term \"Taipei\" avoids implying that Taiwan is a different country on a par with the PRC or that there are \"[[Two Chinas]]\", the PRC and the ROC, both of which would cause difficulties for their host countries.{{citation needed|reason=This whole paragraph needs a citation.|date=May 2018}}\n\nTECROs state that their aim is \"to promote bilateral trade, investment, culture, science and technology exchanges and cooperation, as well as better understanding\", although they perform many of the same functions as an [[embassy]] or [[consulate general]], such as issuing visas and [[Republic of China passport|passports]].

These ancestors emigrated from Ku\u010di either in the 17th or 18th century. One part of the family went to [[Dupilo]] in [[Crmnica]], and the other to the mountains of [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], of which the Medunjani descend from. The family in Dupilo, because of a blood revenge (krvna osveta, or [[Gjakmarrja|gjakmarrje]]), emigrated north, but a part of the family (known as the [[Petrovi\u0107]] at that time) decided to stay. The descendants of these Petrovi\u0107s claim that the [[Metropolitan of Cetinje]] told them that they couldn't be known as Petrovi\u0107 any longer, so they instead adopted the name '''Hrstoderi''' (later '''Hrastoderi''') because they avenged and hung a man on an oak tree (''hrast''), hence their surname.\n\nAnother saying, not too different from the previous one, says that the ancestors of the Rastoders emigrated to Radmanci and converted to [[Islam]]. They didn't have enough food when they arrived in Radmanci, so they peeled off the bark of oak trees (''hrastovi'') in order to enlarge the amount of flour for bread. It is not excluded that by that only oak valley came the surname ''Hrastoder''.\n\nA third story, more of a legend, says that before the coming of the Turks, there lived some ''Rasodijeri'', however, it is not certain whether if they were [[Bogomils]] or others, maybe even [[paganism|Pagans]], but later converted to Islam. They were recorded in books in mosques as ''Hrastoderi'' rather than ''Rasodijeri''.\n\nThe surname without the H (Rastoder) was realised during and after the period of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]], in the registers, instead of being located in mosques, were located in local town and the Hrastoderi were recorded as Rastoderi as the registrars were Montenegrins and even today, the phoneme ''H'' isn't pronounced by Montenegrins and wasn't either at that time.\n\nSome descendants of Rastoder families of Bihor have changed their surnames, such as the [[Kr\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Nurkovi\u0107]] in [[Ro\u017eaje]], as well as [[Medunjanin]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}\n\n==People==\n*[[Rifat Rastoder]], Montenegrin Bosniak politician and deputy speaker of the [[Parliament of Montenegro]]\n*[[\u0160erbo Rastoder]], Montenegrin Bosniak historian and activist for Bosniak rights in Montenegro.\n*[[Osman Rastoder]], (1882\u20131946) Montenegrin Bosniak religious leader and pro-Nazi collaborator.

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

As with all radio, this is done by the [[modem|modulating and demodulation]] of [[carrier wave]]s. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth.

These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]].

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices. In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]] in the US. [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 [[dBm]] (100&nbsp;mW).\n\nTo reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network (PAN) applications.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a [[waveguide]]. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Interference can be caused by overlapping channels. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap (no [[adjacent-channel interference]]). The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing. Channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amount-much less than reusing channels (which causes [[co-channel interference]])-if transmitters are at least a few metres apart.<ref name=\"vilegas\">Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs - Eduard Garcia Villegas, Elena Lopez-Aguilera, Rafael Vidal, Josep Paradells (2007) {{DOI|10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549783}}</ref> In Europe and Japan where channel 13 is available, using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|802.11n]] is [[IEEE 802.11#Channels and international compatibility|recommended]].\n\nHowever, many 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, can prevent access and interfere with other devices' use of other access points as well as with decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) between access points.

Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements.

An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known [[MAC address]]es to join the network,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |title       = Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks\n |last        = Mateti\n |first       = Prabhaker\n |year        = 2005\n |publisher   = [[Wright State University]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering\n |location    = Dayton, Ohio\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100305180937/http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |archivedate = 2010-03-05\n |url-status  = live\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-28\n}}</ref> but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by [[MAC spoofing|spoofing]] an authorized address.\n\n[[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used. In 2018, [[WPA3]] was announced as a replacement for WPA2, increasing security;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|title=WPA3 protocol will make public Wi-Fi hotspots a lot more secure|last=Thubron|first=Rob|date=2018-01-09|website=Techspot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116023123/https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|archive-date=2018-11-16|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> it rolled out on June 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|title=Wi-Fi security is starting to get its biggest upgrade in over a decade|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2018-06-26|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220012909/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|archive-date=2019-02-20|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Piggybacking ===\n{{Main|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}\n{{Further|Legality of piggybacking}}\n{{Further|Wi-Fi Protected Setup#Physical security issues}}\nPiggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.\n\nDuring the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.\n\nRecreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth. Additionally, they have gained the ability to [[Link aggregation|aggregate]] (or 'bond') channels together to gain still more throughput where the bandwidth is available. 802.11n allows for double radio spectrum/bandwidth (40 MHz- 8 channels) compared to [[IEEE 802.11a-1999|802.11a]] or 802.11g (20&nbsp;MHz). 802.11n can also be set to limit itself to 20 MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|title=802.11n Data Rates Dependability and scalability|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Cisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705034144/http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/Aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|archive-date=2017-07-05|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> In the 5 GHz band, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz bandwidth signals are permitted with some restrictions, giving much faster connections.\n\n=== Communication stack ===\n[[File:802.11_frame.png|alt=|right|frameless|622x622px|Generic 802.11 Frame]]\n{{Main|IEEE 802|IEEE 802.11}}\nWi-Fi is part of the IEEE 802 protocol family.

They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had many subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|title=What Does WiFi Stand For and How Does Wifi Work?|last=Stobing|first=Chris|date=2015-11-17|website=GadgetReview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201045951/http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|archivedate=December 1, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nIn addition to 802.11 the IEEE 802 protocol family has specific provisions for Wi-Fi. These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The device sends information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document]]\nIn infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications goes through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called [[wireless ad hoc network|''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission]]. Different types of ad hoc network exist. In the simplest case network nodes must talk directly to each other.

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW.

In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band.

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing.

On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, will not permit a network on that band.\n\nThese bands can be used by low power transmitters without a license, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/mobile-wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|title=Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown|last=Brown|first=Bob|date=2016-03-10|website=[[Network World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227033935/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|archive-date=2019-02-27|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Throughput ===\n[[File:Throughputenvelope80211g.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11g]]\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11n with 40 MHz]]\n\nVarious layer 2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements (the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation), is with a specific packet size (small or large), and with a specific data rate (10 kbit/s \u2013 100 Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. This text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references.

Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.\n\nA Wi-Fi device is a [[short-range device|short-range]] [[wireless]] device. Wi-Fi devices are [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on [[RF CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] ([[RF circuit]]) chips.<ref name=\"Happich\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Veendrick |first1=Harry J.

The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in ever more devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|title=Free WiFi Analyzer-Best Channel Analyzer Apps For Wireless Networks|last=|first=|date=2017-06-08|website=The Digital Worm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808000116/https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|archivedate=2017-08-08|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDifferent competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as \"Wi-Fi Certified\" by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backward compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Access point ===\n[[File:Apple-Airport-Extreme-80211g-WiFi-Card.jpg|thumb|An [[AirPort]] wireless G Wi-Fi adapter from an Apple [[MacBook]].]]\n\nA wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used.

Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health concerns ==\n{{Further|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says, \"no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks\", but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/\n |title       = Electromagnetic fields and public health -
