Around 1878, Frank Lambert invented a machine that used a voice recorded on a lead cylinder to call out the hours. Lambert used lead in place of Edison's soft tinfoil.

On its first day, February 14, 1933, more than 140,000 calls were received. London began a similar service three years later.

There are over 150 tabletop clocks and 50 types of watches that talk. Manufacturers of such clocks include Sharp, [[Panasonic]], [[RadioShack]], and [[Reizen]].  In addition, one manufacturer purportedly produced a clock that would announce the time upon detecting a user's whistling signal.{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Branding/Advertising ===\n\nMany companies have used talking clocks as a novelty item to promote their brand. In 1987, the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] released a clock with the figure of \"Mr. Aristocrat\", a tomato with a motif similar to [[Mr. Peanut]]. At alarm time, the clock said, \"It's time to get up; get up right away! Wait any longer and it's 'ketchup' all day! Remember, Heinz is the thick rich one.\" At roughly the same time, [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] created a similar clock with the character of Little Sprout. In recent years, the Coca-Cola polar bear, the Red and Yellow M&M's characters, the Pillsbury Doughboy, a Campbell's Soup girl, and others have at one time appeared on a talking clock. One of the more interesting branded clocks was produced by [[Energizer]] and was a soft, battery-shaped clock whose alarm was turned off by punching it or throwing it against a hard surface.\n\n=== Entertainment/conversation pieces ===\n[[Image:Jesus talking clock.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Talking Jesus Clock. {{audio|Last_supper_clock.ogg|listen}}]]\nThe inexpensiveness of modern speech technology has allowed manufacturers to include talking clock capabilities into a wide range of products. Many of these are intended as conversation pieces or speak merely for the entertainment of hearing sounds or words spoken by an inanimate object. Such timepieces include Darth Vader clocks, calculators with time features, and even a painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]] that announces the time on the hour along with a quote from Jesus.\n\nOther themes of talking timepieces include fortune-telling, astrology, clocks with moving lips, animated creatures, sports and athletes, and movies, among others.\n\n== Technology ==\n\nMost modern talking clocks are based on speech-synthesis [[integrated circuits]] that generate speech from sampled, stored data. The rapid technological progress of the 1980s enabled today's high-quality talking products. Early talking clocks employed chips that linked phonemes to generate speech.  These products could generate unlimited speech, but it was of relatively poor quality that sounded robotic, at worst, unintelligible. Today's higher-quality speech is produced by sampled-data systems that take elements of an actual human voice. Modern voice synthesis technologies can produce synthesized vocabularies that retain the style of the speaker exactly and are not limited to just perfect English, but can be as varied as Scottish accents, Japanese, and even the voice of a young child. Such voices are all generated using tiny, inexpensive voice chips that are readily available. \n\nAlmost all of the latest voice-chipped talking clocks incorporate the female human voice to announce the time. Dr. Mark McKinley, the president of the International Society of Talking Clock Collectors, proposes three possible explanations for this phenomenon. The female voice may be considered more soothing psychologically; it may be a relic of the female voice being historically associated with secretarial (Administrative Assistant) functions; or a feminine voice may possibly simply be softer in a less intrusive way.<ref>McKinley, Mark B.

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abagail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abagail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abigail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abigail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abigail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abigail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abigail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s.

However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]]. King wrote a new screenplay (toned down slightly for television). The [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|miniseries]] was broadcast in 1994, directed by [[Mick Garris]], and starred such actors as [[Gary Sinise]], [[Adam Storke]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Laura San Giacomo]], [[Jamey Sheridan]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], and [[Shawnee Smith]], with notable cameos including [[John Landis]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Sam Raimi]], and King himself.

In 2004, he was elected as Senator under the senatorial ticket of President Arroyo. He ran for [[President of the Philippines|President]] in the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 Philippine elections]] as the standard-bearer of [[Bagumbayan-VNP|Bagumbayan - Volunteers for a New Philippines]], but was unsuccessful in his bid.

He stayed in Ateneo and completed his tertiary education, earning a degree of Bachelor of Arts, major in History and Government, in 1966. After serving as a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention, he successfully pursued a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree at the [[University of the Philippines]] [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]] in the year 1975.

Gordon gave way for the Aquino appointed Officer-In-Charge after a formal written directive from the Executive Secretary representing Aquino was issued. In the same year, he joined Philippine [[Vice-President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Salvador Laurel]] in reorganizing the [[Nacionalista Party]] around the country. They campaigned for a \"No\" vote on 1987 Constitution framed by the Aquino appointed constitutional convention. In 1988, he was elected as mayor with the help of the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], a breakaway of the Nacionalista Party under [[Danding Cojuangco|Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco]].\n\nOn September 1991 Gordon led a nationwide rally for the retention of the U.S. Bases in the Philippines. The U.S. naval base in [[Subic Bay]] was a major income generating client of Olongapo City. In the same year, Olongapo experienced the greatest volcanic cataclysm of the century when Mt. Pinatubo erupted and dumped 14&nbsp;inches of wet ash on the City. However, on September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate voted 12-11 to reject the extension of a bases treaty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manila Senate Rejects U.S. Pact|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-16/news/mn-1690_1_subic-bay-naval-base|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Wallace|first=Charles|date=September 16, 1991|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Subic===\nThe looming withdrawal of the Americans from the U.S. naval base in Subic meant the loss of over 40,000 jobs for Filipinos who were employed in the said base.<ref name=\"economist-chairman-sbma\">{{citation|title=The chairman of Subic Bay, Inc|publisher=The Economist|date=October 7, 1995}}</ref> Also, $8 million worth of infrastructure left behind by the Americans in the base and was in danger of being looted from outsiders, as evidenced by the looting that occurred in 1991 at the Clark Air Base due to the aftermath of the Pinatubo eruption.<ref name=\"nytimes-subic-success\">{{cite news|title=Subic Bay, Minus U.S., Becomes Surprise Success|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/23/world/subic-bay-minus-us-becomes-surprise-success.html|publisher=New York Times|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=November 23, 1996|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTo address the problems beforehand, Gordon led the citizens of Olongapo to mobilize and lobby for the inclusion of a free port concept into the national legislation for the conversion of the U.S. bases. The effort was successful, with the inclusion of the establishment of the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]] (also known as the Subic Special Economic Zone) in Section 12 of Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the Bases Conversion and Development Act, which was approved on March 13, 1992.

In 1993, a citizen questioned Gordon's dual duty as mayor of Olongapo City and as chairman of the [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]]. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decided that Gordon must hold one position. Gordon decided to vacate his position as Mayor and assumed the position of SBMA chairman in full capacity. In the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 local elections]], his wife Katherine, a three-term Congresswoman, was elected mayor of Olongapo. In the 1996 [[APEC]] Summit, 18 world leaders were impressed with the facility and Subic became a new investment hub in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"nytimes-subic-success\" /> Bluechip companies like [[FedEx Express]], [[Enron]], Coastal Petroleum now [[El Paso Corporation]], Taiwan computer giant [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] and France telecoms company [[Thomson SA]] invested US$2.1 Billion in the freeport reinvigorating the economy and creating 200,000 jobs replacing those lost during the US Navy withdrawal.\n\nIn 1998 Gordon resigned as Chairman of the SBMA in order to run for president in the national elections held during that year. However, he eventually backed out from pursuing his candidacy. He was later re-appointed by outgoing President Fidel Ramos as chairman of the SBMA for a new six-year term.<ref name=\"gordon-quits-sbma\">{{cite web|title=Defiant Orbos is Rene veep|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_VYbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-0oEAAAAIBAJ&dq=felicito%20payumo&pg=6477%2C962186|publisher=Manila Standard Today|date=February 10, 1998|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"jo-commerce-petitionjunked\">{{citation|title=Battered Subic chief loses appeal to stay|publisher=Journal of Commerce|date=September 2, 1998}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s Gordon was a fierce critic of Joseph Estrada due to their difference of opinions regarding the US Naval Base.

Gordon refused to step down, stating that his re-appointment from the Ramos administration gave him civil service protection.<ref name=\"jo-commerce-petitionjunked\"/> The removal process was not easy. Hundreds of volunteers and paid people barricaded the gates of SBMA and Gordon locked himself inside the SBMA Administrative Office Building 229. After this, he was dubbed a dictator because of the fact that he rebelled against an executive order.  The issue sparked the interest local and foreign press known as the {{YouTube|A-w9gAX6j_Y|Showdown at Subic}}.\n\nGordon filed for a temporary restraining order before the local court. The local court of Olongapo granted Gordon's request but Payumo's party filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA).
