The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]], to form the DSA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n''The New York Times'' reported on the Convention for three other days:\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721228-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members.

This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left-wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

The statement called the [[United States embargoes|sanctions placed on Venezuela]] by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] unjust and illegal.

A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/democratic_socialists_of_america_condemns_the_u_s_bombing_of_syria|title=Democratic Socialists of America Condemns the U.S. Bombing of Syria|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/2019-convention-a-world-to-win/|title=2019 Convention: A World to Win|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/demsocialists/status/899489883428982784?lang=en|title=DSA \ud83c\udf39 on Twitter|website=Twitter}}</ref> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]].

This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/lesbian_gay_bisexual_transgender_queer_and_intersex_rights|title=Statement on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Rights|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements. The DSA further says that socialist feminism must include the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.<ref name=\"dsausa.org6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/uniting_to_build_a_socialist_feminist_movement|title=Uniting to Build a Socialist Feminist Movement|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ===\n{{see also|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\nThe DSA is opposed to [[Zionism]] and the current form of the [[State of Israel]].

The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States.

In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingunion.wordpress.com|title=Talking Union: A Project of the DSA Labor Network|publisher=Talkingunion.wordpress.com|date=|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1195/walking-the-tightrope/|title=Walking the tightrope - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left-wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\".

She was christened Ana Maria de las Nieves (Ana Maria of the Snows) due to the unusual snowstorm that took place on the day of her birth.  However, throughout her life and public activity she used different variants of her name, which she explained as follows:  Ana Maria Romero, was her maiden name; Ana Maria Romero de Campero her married name, and the one registered on her identity card; Ana Maria Campero, her journalistic name; and Anamar, her nom de guerre.<ref>Baudoin, Magela. \u201cMujeres de Costado\u201d. Plural Editores, 2010.</ref>\n\nShe lived part of her childhood with her siblings under the care of her paternal grandmother, a woman whose strong character, tenacity and severe discipline definitely influenced her education.  At the same time, her childhood was deeply impacted by the vicissitudes of Bolivian politics.  Her father, Gonzalo Romero, was a leading figure of the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB) party, a political movement that joined the opposition after the April 1952 Revolution, and was subject to political persecution by the ruling regime.\n\nHer paternal family came from the town of [[Nor Cinti Province|Cinti]], in the rural area of southern Bolivia, where she often traveled during her childhood and which she liked to evoke due to the beauty of its landscape.  Both her paternal grandfather and her great-grandfather had also been involved in diplomacy, journalism and politics.\n\nAna Maria Romero was educated at the Sacred Heart School in the city of [[La Paz (Bolivia)|La Paz]] and at the Irish Catholic School in [[Cochabamba]], where she lived for a year when her father went into exile.  Possessing strong convictions and great charisma, she showed leadership skills from her college days when she was elected president of the Catholic University's Journalism Student Center, between 1968 and 1970.\n\nIn 1961, Ana Maria Romero married Fernando A. Campero Prudencio, a marriage that lasted for 49 years until her death. She frequently portrayed her husband as a self-reliant person, who was ahead of his time and who supported her to grow professionally and intellectually. Her marriage and subsequent motherhood to three children did not prevent her from completing her university studies, developing a renowned career in journalism and excelling in public life, even at a time when these activities were primarily male-dominated.\n\n== University studies and journalism ==\n\nAna Maria Romero was a precocious reader in the great library of her paternal family, which included not only literature but also politics and philosophy, and which helped to later define her inclination towards journalism.  Encouraged by the domestic climate and by her uncle, the lawyer and journalist Carlos Romero, she began her career in journalism after her first two children were born.\n\nShe practiced journalism for three decades, occupying a variety of functions and positions throughout her career.  She worked as a reporter, columnist and international press correspondent in Bolivia as well as abroad.  Romero graduated as a journalist from the Catholic University of Bolivia in 1976.  Later, she took courses in theology at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington DC]], in the US (1985).\n\nAt the age of 25, Romero joined the weekly magazine of the El Diario newspaper as chronicler.  While working as a journalist at the Fides News Agency and at Radio Fides (until 1979), she met key figures in the history of Bolivia, including the journalist Jesuit Luis Espinal, assassinated in March 1980.  In May 1980, Ana Maria Romero founded the weekly magazine Apertura (Opening) along with her mentor Jos\u00e9 Gramunt de Moragas S.J. and other journalists.  Apertura, which started as a space for the defense of democracy, survived for 10 weeks and was then forced to close as a result of the regime of terror and despotism imposed by the dictator [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza Tejada|Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]] and his then Interior Minister, [[Luis Arce G\u00f3mez]].\n\nFor seven years she led as Chief Editor and Executive Director one of her country's most influential newspapers, the national daily Presencia, owned by the [[Catholic Church]], where earlier she had also acted as its Deputy Director and Head of Press.  In 1998 she was conferred the National Journalism Award \u201cfor a work conducted with recognized ethics and professional excellence\u201d.\n\nAmong the agencies and national and international media organizations for which she reported are the magazines [[TIME]] (US) and Proceso ([[M\u00e9xico]]); the news agencies Fides ([[Bolivia]]), [[Inter Press Service]] ([[Italy]]), and the German Press Agency [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]; and the newspapers [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] ([[Spain]]), Hoy ([[Ecuador]]), La Rep\u00fablica ([[Uruguay]]), El Diario ([[Bolivia]]), Presencia ([[Bolivia]]) and La Raz\u00f3n ([[Bolivia]])\n\nAna Maria Romero also maintained an active guild participation.   The first woman to preside over the Association of Journalists, she also founded and led the Circle of Women Journalists.  During her tenure (1988-1990), the organization established the National Journalism Award.  She was later elected President of the National Press Association.  She also acted as Secretary General of the Latin American Catholic Press Association (UCLAP), was Member of the Permanent Council of International Catholic Union of the Press (UCIP) and Vice President of the International Federation of Newspapers.\n\n== Ombudswoman and Human Rights ==\n\nIn 1998 she was appointed by the Bolivian National Congress as the country's first Defensor del Pueblo (an office broadly translating its intent into English as \u201cHuman Rights Ombudsman\u201d), after being nominated by the major news organizations in the country and receiving more than two-thirds of the election votes at the National Congress.\n\nHer ideals of freedom and inclusion, along with her purposeful defense of universal human rights, were rapidly taken up during a tenure that made history for making visible sectors that had been historically marginalized within Bolivian society.  Also, her position acquired great public importance by giving the Ombudsman Office a role of mediator in many of the social and political conflicts facing the country.\nAs Ombudswoman she denounced the violations against human rights that were taking place in the Chapare region as a result of the clashes between security forces and coca growers.  Similarly, she worked against human traffic networks and in favor of discriminated groups, such as domestic workers, renal patients, AIDS victims, prisoners, and indigenous workers, among many others.  She elicited public respect for her dedication to her work, accompanied by a moderate use of her public voice, always taking care to choose the most appropriate tone to issue warnings, claims and judgments.\n\nHaving become a respected figure who was at the same time feared by the political spectrum, her continuation as Ombudswoman began to be questioned by a sector of the ruling party, the [[Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario]] (MNR), and their representation in Congress.  In September 2003, President [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]] refused to re-elect Ana Maria Romero into office and ordered the bench of the MNR to block the vote in her favor in Congress.  This provoked a confrontation with Vice President [[Carlos Mesa]] Gisbert, who tried unsuccessfully to prevent this move, given the excellent reputation of the departing Ombudswoman.  In 2003, Ana Maria Romero completed her constitutional mandate as Ombudswoman, with a record that earned her widespread recognition and numerous national and international awards.\n\nIn 2004 Romero created the UNIR Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n UNIR), a non-governmental organization that has since been working in the construction of mediation processes and promotion of a culture of peace in Bolivia through initiatives of dialogue, negotiation during conflicts, information and deliberation, which she directed until 2008.  During the political crisis of 2007 and 2008, generated by the opposition of Bolivia's eastern Departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija to the Government of the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) and the Presidency of Evo Morales, the UNIR Foundation sponsored several workshops and initiatives for dialogue in these Departments, as well as in La Paz and El Alto, to bring these politically confrontational sectors, which held entrenched positions, closer together.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda Romero headed the UNIR Foundation until December 2008, when she retired to take a break and devote her time to writing a novel, which she would not be able to finish due to her entry into politics and her subsequent illness.\n\n== Political life ==\n\nAna Maria Romero was an active advocate of democracy and human rights in her country.  In 1979 she interrupted her career as journalist to take up the post of Minister of Press and Information, during the brief Government of Walter Guevara.  Guevara became Bolivia's President by constitutional succession in August 1979 but was overthrown by a military coup led by Colonel [[Alberto Natusch]] in November of that year in the so-called \"All Saints Massacre\", where more than 100 people were killed in a massive deployment of violence that showed outstanding brutality.\n\nDuring this period, Ana Maria Romero was given the task of coordinating with the national press and more than 100 international journalists that had arrived in the country to cover the Ninth General Assembly of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).  Bolivia obtained a major diplomatic victory during this gathering by approving a declaration which recognized \"the Bolivian maritime claim as a matter of hemispheric interest\".\n\nWhen she assumed the Ministry of Press and Information portfolio, her father, Gonzalo Romero, was already Bolivia's Ambassador to the OAS.  Father and daughter met in public service, where he gave an outstanding performance as mastermind and chief promoter of the OAS resolution in 1979 which urged [[Chile]] to give [[Bolivia]] a sovereign and useful outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nBut Romero's most decisive performance as Minister was as the head of the democratic resistance to the military coup.   On 1 November 1979, as Colonel [[Alberto Natusch|Natusch]] took power by force, Ana Maria Romero bravely defended the democratic Government in radio speeches throughout that bloody day.  It was she who performed the function of discrediting the versions of Guevara's resignation being put forward by the de facto regime, announcing the existence of a clandestine Constitutional Government and defending the rule of law.\n\nYears later, on 11 October 2003, the Bolivian army forces, on the orders of the Government of [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]], fired on an angry crowd from the city of [[El Alto, La Paz|El Alto]].  The crowd had been trying to stop a convoy carrying fuel and food into the City of La Paz, which needed these supplies after several days of blockages by social movements unified around the premise of the nationalization of hydrocarbons and the convening of a new Constituent Assembly to refound Bolivia.  The shooting left 29 people dead and countless wounded.<ref>Latin American Social Observatory. \u201cLa Guerra del Gas en Bolivia\u201d. Year IV, No. 12, September\u2013December 2003. [http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/osal/osal12/d1mamani.pdf]</ref>  In reaction to these events, Ana Maria Romero led a hunger strike calling for peace and the resignation of Sanchez de Lozada.  With indigenous leaders, intellectuals, students, teachers and representatives of civil society, she spoke strongly against the violence that took place in El Alto and in defense of the large number of victims of what came to be known as the [[Bolivian gas conflict|\"Gas War\".]]\n\nThanks to her influence and steep rise in influence, Romero received numerous invitations to be a candidate for president and vice president, both from parties of the right and left, which she rejected consistently, respecting the provisions of the Ombudsman Act of Bolivia that prevents those who occupy this function to apply for any elective public office during the five years following the termination of their mandate. Despite the fact that this law violated her civil and political rights, Romero unreservedly complied, because \"it was important to establish that the institution should not serve as a political springboard into politics, as was the case in other countries\".<ref>In the article: \"My civil and political rights\", September 13, 2009, Ana Maria Romero de Campero stated: \"When exercising the functions as Ombudswoman, between 1998 and 2003, Dr. Ren\u00e9 Blatmann, remarkable jurist and now judge of the International Criminal Court, suggested an appeal of unconstitutionality against the Ombudsman Act on the grounds that it violated my civil and political rights and of those who would hold this Office in the future. In his opinion, it was unacceptable to require any officer to refrain from opting for elective office during the five years following the termination of his/her mandate as Ombudsperson (...)

But the horror that we may end up dividing our country and the concern that the process which could enable us to build an equitable and just country might become frustrated, have sunk-in in me during this time of my retirement and I have decided to take the step forward.   I am acting under the conviction that I cannot deny offering my efforts to build bridges and to seek agreements \u2013which is what President Morales has asked me to help with.

It is a biannual award, granted on the [[International Day of Peace]] (September 21st) and is organized by a number of institutions along with the UNIR Foundation. In its first edition in 2012, the award was given to the Priest Gregorio Iriarte.\n\n::* The Bolivian organization \"Training and Citizen Rights\" (CDC by their Spanish initials) and its network of professional lawyers in human rights, created the national human rights award \"Ana Maria Romero de Campero\", with the purpose of recognizing citizens who have distinguished themselves in the promotion, recognition and defense of [[human rights]], as well as in the promotion of democratic values.\n\nIn a different expression of recognition for her work, at the spontaneous initiative of a group of parents of the San Miguel Urbanization in 7th District of the city of El Alto, a new educational unit was named after the Bolivian journalist in that area.  It serves elementary school children that live with high levels of marginalization.\n\nAlso, the newspaper \u201cOpinion\u201d of Cochabamba, Bolivia published a special edition of its Special Report supplement: the article \"Anamar - Loved by People and Feared by Politicians.\"  This report reviews Ana Maria Romero's life, work and contribution to journalism, the defense of human rights, and the history of her country.

She was christened Ana Maria de las Nieves (Ana Maria of the Snows) due to the unusual snowstorm that took place on the day of her birth.  However, throughout her life and public activity she used different variants of her name, which she explained as follows:  Ana Maria Romero, was her maiden name; Ana Maria Romero de Campero her married name, and the one registered on her identity card; Ana Maria Campero, her journalistic name; and Anamar, her nom de guerre.<ref>Baudoin, Magela. \u201cMujeres de Costado\u201d. Plural Editores, 2010.</ref>\n\nShe lived part of her childhood with her siblings under the care of her paternal grandmother, a woman whose strong character, tenacity and severe discipline definitely influenced her education.  At the same time, her childhood was deeply impacted by the vicissitudes of Bolivian politics.  Her father, Gonzalo Romero, was a leading figure of the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB) party, a political movement that joined the opposition after the April 1952 Revolution, and was subject to political persecution by the ruling regime.\n\nHer paternal family came from the town of [[Nor Cinti Province|Cinti]], in the rural area of southern Bolivia, where she often traveled during her childhood and which she liked to evoke due to the beauty of its landscape.  Both her paternal grandfather and her great-grandfather had also been involved in diplomacy, journalism and politics.\n\nAna Maria Romero was educated at the Sacred Heart School in the city of [[La Paz (Bolivia)|La Paz]] and at the Irish Catholic School in [[Cochabamba]], where she lived for a year when her father went into exile.  Possessing strong convictions and great charisma, she showed leadership skills from her college days when she was elected president of the Catholic University\u2019s Journalism Student Center, between 1968 and 1970.\n\nIn 1961, Ana Maria Romero married Fernando A. Campero Prudencio, a marriage that lasted for 49 years until her death. She frequently portrayed her husband as a self-reliant person, who was ahead of his time and who supported her to grow professionally and intellectually. Her marriage and subsequent motherhood to three children did not prevent her from completing her university studies, developing a renowned career in journalism and excelling in public life, even at a time when these activities were primarily male-dominated.\n\n== University studies and journalism ==\n\nAna Maria Romero was a precocious reader in the great library of her paternal family, which included not only literature but also politics and philosophy, and which helped to later define her inclination towards journalism.  Encouraged by the domestic climate and by her uncle, the lawyer and journalist Carlos Romero, she began her career in journalism after her first two children were born.\n\nShe practiced journalism for three decades, occupying a variety of functions and positions throughout her career.  She worked as a reporter, columnist and international press correspondent in Bolivia as well as abroad.  Romero graduated as a journalist from the Catholic University of Bolivia in 1976.  Later, she took courses in theology at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington DC]], in the US (1985).\n\nAt the age of 25, Romero joined the weekly magazine of the El Diario newspaper as chronicler.  While working as a journalist at the Fides News Agency and at Radio Fides (until 1979), she met key figures in the history of Bolivia, including the journalist Jesuit Luis Espinal, assassinated in March 1980.  In May 1980, Ana Maria Romero founded the weekly magazine Apertura (Opening) along with her mentor Jos\u00e9 Gramunt de Moragas S.J. and other journalists.  Apertura, which started as a space for the defense of democracy, survived for 10 weeks and was then forced to close as a result of the regime of terror and despotism imposed by the dictator [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza Tejada|Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]] and his then Interior Minister, [[Luis Arce G\u00f3mez]].\n\nFor seven years she led as Chief Editor and Executive Director one of her country's most influential newspapers, the national daily Presencia, owned by the [[Catholic Church]], where earlier she had also acted as its Deputy Director and Head of Press.  In 1998 she was conferred the National Journalism Award \u201cfor a work conducted with recognized ethics and professional excellence\u201d.\n\nAmong the agencies and national and international media organizations for which she reported are the magazines [[TIME]] (US) and Proceso ([[M\u00e9xico]]); the news agencies Fides ([[Bolivia]]), [[Inter Press Service]] ([[Italy]]), and the German Press Agency [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]; and the newspapers [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] ([[Spain]]), Hoy ([[Ecuador]]), La Rep\u00fablica ([[Uruguay]]), El Diario ([[Bolivia]]), Presencia ([[Bolivia]]) and La Raz\u00f3n ([[Bolivia]])\n\nAna Maria Romero also maintained an active guild participation.   The first woman to preside over the Association of Journalists, she also founded and led the Circle of Women Journalists.  During her tenure (1988-1990), the organization established the National Journalism Award.  She was later elected President of the National Press Association.  She also acted as Secretary General of the Latin American Catholic Press Association (UCLAP), was Member of the Permanent Council of International Catholic Union of the Press (UCIP) and Vice President of the International Federation of Newspapers.\n\n== Ombudswoman and Human Rights ==\n\nIn 1998 she was appointed by the Bolivian National Congress as the country\u2019s first Defensor del Pueblo (an office broadly translating its intent into English as \u201cHuman Rights Ombudsman\u201d), after being nominated by the major news organizations in the country and receiving more than two-thirds of the election votes at the National Congress.\n\nHer ideals of freedom and inclusion, along with her purposeful defense of universal human rights, were rapidly taken up during a tenure that made history for making visible sectors that had been historically marginalized within Bolivian society.  Also, her position acquired great public importance by giving the Ombudsman Office a role of mediator in many of the social and political conflicts facing the country.\nAs Ombudswoman she denounced the violations against human rights that were taking place in the Chapare region as a result of the clashes between security forces and coca growers.  Similarly, she worked against human traffic networks and in favor of discriminated groups, such as domestic workers, renal patients, AIDS victims, prisoners, and indigenous workers, among many others.  She elicited public respect for her dedication to her work, accompanied by a moderate use of her public voice, always taking care to choose the most appropriate tone to issue warnings, claims and judgments.\n\nHaving become a respected figure who was at the same time feared by the political spectrum, her continuation as Ombudswoman began to be questioned by a sector of the ruling party, the [[Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario]] (MNR), and their representation in Congress.  In September 2003, President [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]] refused to re-elect Ana Maria Romero into office and ordered the bench of the MNR to block the vote in her favor in Congress.  This provoked a confrontation with Vice President [[Carlos Mesa]] Gisbert, who tried unsuccessfully to prevent this move, given the excellent reputation of the departing Ombudswoman.  In 2003, Ana Maria Romero completed her constitutional mandate as Ombudswoman, with a record that earned her widespread recognition and numerous national and international awards.\n\nIn 2004 Romero created the UNIR Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n UNIR), a non-governmental organization that has since been working in the construction of mediation processes and promotion of a culture of peace in Bolivia through initiatives of dialogue, negotiation during conflicts, information and deliberation, which she directed until 2008.  During the political crisis of 2007 and 2008, generated by the opposition of Bolivia\u2019s eastern Departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija to the Government of the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) and the Presidency of Evo Morales, the UNIR Foundation sponsored several workshops and initiatives for dialogue in these Departments, as well as in La Paz and El Alto, to bring these politically confrontational sectors, which held entrenched positions, closer together.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda Romero headed the UNIR Foundation until December 2008, when she retired to take a break and devote her time to writing a novel, which she would not be able to finish due to her entry into politics and her subsequent illness.\n\n== Political life ==\n\nAna Maria Romero was an active advocate of democracy and human rights in her country.  In 1979 she interrupted her career as journalist to take up the post of Minister of Press and Information, during the brief Government of Walter Guevara.  Guevara became Bolivia\u2019s President by constitutional succession in August 1979 but was overthrown by a military coup led by Colonel [[Alberto Natusch]] in November of that year in the so-called \"All Saints Massacre\", where more than 100 people were killed in a massive deployment of violence that showed outstanding brutality.\n\nDuring this period, Ana Maria Romero was given the task of coordinating with the national press and more than 100 international journalists that had arrived in the country to cover the Ninth General Assembly of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).  Bolivia obtained a major diplomatic victory during this gathering by approving a declaration which recognized \"the Bolivian maritime claim as a matter of hemispheric interest\".\n\nWhen she assumed the Ministry of Press and Information portfolio, her father, Gonzalo Romero, was already Bolivia\u2019s Ambassador to the OAS.  Father and daughter met in public service, where he gave an outstanding performance as mastermind and chief promoter of the OAS resolution in 1979 which urged [[Chile]] to give [[Bolivia]] a sovereign and useful outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nBut Romero\u2019s most decisive performance as Minister was as the head of the democratic resistance to the military coup.   On 1 November 1979, as Colonel [[Alberto Natusch|Natusch]] took power by force, Ana Maria Romero bravely defended the democratic Government in radio speeches throughout that bloody day.  It was she who performed the function of discrediting the versions of Guevara\u2019s resignation being put forward by the de facto regime, announcing the existence of a clandestine Constitutional Government and defending the rule of law.\n\nYears later, on 11 October 2003, the Bolivian army forces, on the orders of the Government of [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]], fired on an angry crowd from the city of [[El Alto, La Paz|El Alto]].  The crowd had been trying to stop a convoy carrying fuel and food into the City of La Paz, which needed these supplies after several days of blockages by social movements unified around the premise of the nationalization of hydrocarbons and the convening of a new Constituent Assembly to refound Bolivia.  The shooting left 29 people dead and countless wounded.<ref>Latin American Social Observatory. \u201cLa Guerra del Gas en Bolivia\u201d. Year IV, No. 12, September\u2013December 2003. [http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/osal/osal12/d1mamani.pdf]</ref>  In reaction to these events, Ana Maria Romero led a hunger strike calling for peace and the resignation of Sanchez de Lozada.  With indigenous leaders, intellectuals, students, teachers and representatives of civil society, she spoke strongly against the violence that took place in El Alto and in defense of the large number of victims of what came to be known as the [[Bolivian gas conflict|\"Gas War\".]]\n\nThanks to her influence and steep rise in influence, Romero received numerous invitations to be a candidate for President and Vice President, both from parties of the right and left, which she rejected consistently, respecting the provisions of the Ombudsman Act of Bolivia that prevents those who occupy this function to apply for any elective public office during the five years following the termination of their mandate. Despite the fact that this law violated her civil and political rights, Romero unreservedly complied, because \"it was important to establish that the institution should not serve as a political springboard into politics, as was the case in other countries\".<ref>In the article: \"My civil and political rights\", September 13, 2009, Ana Maria Romero de Campero stated: \"When exercising the functions as Ombudswoman, between 1998 and 2003, Dr. Ren\u00e9 Blatmann, remarkable jurist and now judge of the International Criminal Court, suggested an appeal of unconstitutionality against the Ombudsman Act on the grounds that it violated my civil and political rights and of those who would hold this Office in the future. In his opinion, it was unacceptable to require any officer to refrain from opting for elective office during the five years following the termination of his/her mandate as Ombudsperson (...) I agreed with him as to that this article in the Act clearly implied restriction of a constitutional right, but I said that as the first Ombudswoman I considered it important to establish that this Institution should not serve as a springboard into politics, as happened in other countries.

It is a biannual award, granted on the [[International Day of Peace]] (September 21st) and is organized by a number of institutions along with the UNIR Foundation. In its first edition in 2012, the award was given to the Priest Gregorio Iriarte.\n\n::* The Bolivian organization \"Training and Citizen Rights\" (CDC by their Spanish initials) and its network of professional lawyers in human rights, created the national human rights award \"Ana Maria Romero de Campero\", with the purpose of recognizing citizens who have distinguished themselves in the promotion, recognition and defense of [[human rights]], as well as in the promotion of democratic values.\n\nIn a different expression of recognition for her work, at the spontaneous initiative of a group of parents of the San Miguel Urbanization in 7th District of the city of El Alto, a new educational unit was named after the Bolivian journalist in that area.  It serves elementary school children that live with high levels of marginalization.\n\nAlso, the newspaper \u201cOpinion\u201d of Cochabamba, Bolivia published a special edition of its Special Report supplement: the article \"Anamar - Loved by People and Feared by Politicians.\"  This report reviews Ana Maria Romero\u2019s life, work and contribution to journalism, the defense of human rights, and the history of her country.  This journalistic piece was awarded the 2012 National Journalism Award for printed media, the country's highest award of its kind, granted by the Association of Journalists of La Paz.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Mesa de Jose, Gisbert Teresa, Mesa Gisbert Carlos, ''Historia de Bolivia'' (La Paz: Ed.

The elder Reagan commented in his [[White House]] diary on this day that Ron's performance was reminiscent of [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/white-house-diaries/diary-entry-05181981/ |title=White House Diaries: Monday, May 18, 1981|accessdate= July 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Careers==\nReagan became more politically active after his father left the White House in 1989. In contrast to his father, the younger Reagan's views were unabashedly liberal. In a 2009 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, Ron said that he did not speak out politically during his father's term because the press \"never cared about my opinions ''as such,'' only as they related to ''him''\", adding that he did not want to create the impression that he and his father were on bad terms because of political differences. In 1991, Reagan hosted ''The Ron Reagan Show'', a syndicated late-night talk show addressing political issues of the day, which was canceled after a brief run since it was unable to compete with the higher ratings of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nReagan has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist, and has hosted talk shows on cable TV networks such as the [[Animal Planet]] network. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], he is best known for having co-presented ''[[Record Breakers]]'' (based on ''[[The Guinness Book of Records]]'') for the [[BBC]]. Reagan presented a report from the United States each week.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/571186/index.html Profile], screenonline.org.uk; accessed September 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nHe has served on the board of the [[Creative Coalition]], an organization founded in 1989 by a group that included [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Christopher Reeve]], to politically mobilize entertainers and artists, generally for [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, and causes such as arts advocacy and public education. From February to December 2005, Reagan co-hosted the talk show ''[[Connected: Coast to Coast]] with [[Monica Crowley]]'' on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|713985}}</ref>\n\nUntil its demise in 2010, [[Air America Media]] aired ''The Ron Reagan Show.''

In 1991, Reagan hosted ''The Ron Reagan Show'', a syndicated late-night talk show addressing political issues of the day, which was canceled after a brief run since it was unable to compete with the higher ratings of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nReagan has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist, and has hosted talk shows on cable TV networks such as the [[Animal Planet]] network.

The choir was simply the east part of the nave, and was fenced off by a screen or low railing, called ''cancelli'', which is where the English word [[chancel]] comes from. The development of the architectural feature known as the choir is the result of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] development brought about by the end of persecutions under [[Constantine the Great]] and the rise of [[monasticism]].

[[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Honorius of Autun]] write that the term is derived from the \"corona\", the circle of clergy or singers who surrounded the altar.\n\nWhen first introduced, the choir was attached to the [[Bema#Christianity|bema]], the elevated platform in the center of the nave on which were placed seats for the higher clergy and a [[lectern]] for scripture readings. This arrangement can still be observed at the [[Basilica]] of [[St. Mary Major]] in Rome. Over time, the bema (or [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]]) and choir moved eastward to their current position. In some churches, such as [[Westminster Cathedral]], the choir is arranged in the [[apse]] behind the [[altar]].\n\nThe architectural details of the choir developed in response to its function as the place where the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] was chanted by the monastic brotherhood or the [[chapter house|chapter]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]]. The chancel was regarded as the clergy's part of the church, and any choirboys from a choir school counted as part of the clergy for this purpose. After the Reformation, when the number of clergy present even in large churches and cathedrals tended to reduce, and lay singing choirs became more frequent, there were often objections to placing them in the traditional choir stalls in the chancel. The [[pulpit]] and [[lectern]] are also usually found at the front of the choir, though both Catholic and Protestant churches have sometimes moved the pulpit to the nave for better audibility. The [[organ (instrument)|organ]] may be located here, or in a loft elsewhere in the church. Some [[cathedral]]s have a retro-choir behind the High Altar, opening eastward towards the [[chapel]]s ([[chantry|chantries]]) in the eastern extremity.\n\nAfter the Reformation Protestant churches generally moved the altar (now often called the [[communion table]]) forward, typically to the front of the chancel, and often used lay choirs who were placed in a gallery at the west end. The choir and rear of deep chancels became little used in churches surviving from the Middle Ages, and new churches very often omitted one. With the emphasis on sermons, and their audibility, some churches simply converted their chancels to seat part of the congregation. In 19th-century England one of the battles of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], the architectural wing of the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s in the [[Church of England]], was to restore the chancel, including the choir, as a necessary part of a church. By pushing the altar back to its medieval position and having the choir used by a lay choir, they were largely successful in this, although the harder end of the [[High Church]] objected to allowing a large group of laity into the chancel.<ref>White, James F., ''The Cambridge Movement: The Ecclesiologists and the Gothic Revival'', 93\u201397, 1962 (2004 reprint), Wipf and Stock Publishers, {{ISBN|1592449379}}, 9781592449378, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zDhLAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94 google books]</ref> Different approaches to worship in the 20th century again tended to push altars in larger churches forward, to be closer to the congregation, and the chancel again risks being a less used area of the church.\n\n==Seating==\n[[Image:Stalles.eglise.Anellau.png|thumb|Illustration showing monk's stalls at Anellau, France, 14th century]]\nThe choir area is occupied by sometimes finely carved and decorated wooden seats known as ''choir stalls'', where the clergy sit, stand or kneel during services.

There may be several rows of seating running parallel to the walls of the church.\n\nThe use of choir stalls (as opposed to benches) is more traditional in [[monasteries]] and [[collegiate church]]es. Monastic choir stalls are often fitted with seats that fold up when the [[Monasticism|monastics]] stand and fold down when they sit. Often the hinged seat will have a [[misericord]] (small wooden seat) on the underside on which he can lean while standing during the long services. The upper part of the monk's stall is so shaped as to provide a headrest while sitting, and arm rests when standing.
