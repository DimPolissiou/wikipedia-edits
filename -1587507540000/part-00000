The line was connected to the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER) nearby.{{sfn|Conolly|1998|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Jowett|1989|loc=Map 52}} The station is sometimes referred to as \"Brayton Gates\" or plain \"Selby\", though it was around a mile from the much larger {{rws|Selby}} station.\n\n==The station buildings==\nThe line originally had three stations, Selby (Brayton Gates), {{rws|Wistow}} and {{rws|Cawood}}. The Brayton Gates terminus was temporary and wooden, with a shelter. It closed in 1904 when trains were diverted to the NER's main {{rws|Selby}} station. It had been the CW&SLR's aim to run to the main Selby station from the outset, but this was thwarted by the NER, ostensibly because they were planning a significant upgrade. In contrast, Cawood's and Wistow's permanent, brick-built station buildings were similar, but clearly differed from the NER's typical rural station. The main difference between the two was that Wistow station building stood alongside the platform, parallel to the track, whilst the Cawood building stood at right angles to it.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=33}} In 1899 the company obtained parliamentary approval to build an extension to [[Church Fenton]]; this never happened, but had it done so the Cawood station building would have had to be demolished or bipassed.\n\nNo photograph or track diagram of the Brayton Gates station has been published. Its exact location is unclear, even on the 1906 25\" OS Map.<ref>[http://maps.nls.uk/view/125642854 The former station area on the 1906 25\" OS map] ''National Library of Scotland''</ref>\n\n==The line and traffic==\nThe line had an exceptionally low [[route availability]] of \"two\". Operators could easily supply very light goods engines which did not need [[Railway brake#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]], but had precious few very light passenger locomotives. The founding company hired a loco - \"Cawood\" - and two coaches specifically for the job. When the NER took over they modified at least one steam locomotive for the line. After trains were diverted to the main Selby station the NER developed a pioneering pair of [[1903 Petrol Electric Autocar|Petrol-electric Autocars]] which were sent to Selby in 1908 to run the Cawood service, among others.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=24}}\n\nThe autocars ceased working the line in the early 1920s, when it reverted to steam haulage, with trains composed of a single \"Bogie Brake third\" coach worked by a [[NER Class E]] [[0-6-0T]] or, occasionally, [[NER Bogie Tank Passenger|BTP]] [[0-4-4T]] No. 189.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=26}}\n\nOn 9 July 1923 a quite different form of [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion-powered]] provision was deployed on some services in the form of the unique \"Leyland\" petrol railbus, a converted 26-seater NER road bus of conventional appearance for the period.<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/IC/ner_petrol_bus.php The LNER petrol rail bus] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> This ran a wide-ranging diagram including the Cawood branch{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=48}} which came to a sudden end on 11 November 1926 when the railbus was destroyed by fire while refuelling at Selby.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=9, 11 & 26-27}}\n\nOn 1 May 1928 Selby received its first [[British steam railcars#Sentinel\u2013Cammell|Sentinel steam railcars]].{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=}}<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/Railcar/sentinel.php The LNER Sentinel Railcars] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> No. 220 \"Water Witch\" may have been the first to work to Cawood, but it was destroyed in a collision near Doncaster on 9 June 1929.

A handful of ancient [[0-6-0T]]s were regularly in charge, notably [[LNER Class J71|J71]]s 68285 and 68286 and veteran \"Ironclad\" [[LNER Class J77|J77]] 68406, with a [[LNER Class J72|J72]] appearing more often in the late 1950s.

The journey time was 17 minutes.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}} By July 1899 the timings had been adjusted and one train had been removed on Tuesdays to Saturdays. On Monday - Selby's Market Day - an extra train was provided out and back mid-morning and an extra from Brayton Gates at teatime, which returned empty.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=17-18}} By 1910 the unbalanced teatime Market Train had been withdrawn and timings had been adjusted, but the pattern of four a day plus a Market Day extra remained, with the added benefit that the first train from Cawood in the morning ran through to York. The journey time remained 17 minutes despite the extra mile to reach Selby's main station instead of Brayton Gates.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby April 1910 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|April 1910 Railway timetable]]\n\nBy 1914 there were two Market Day extras and four daily trains,{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=46}} but by 1923, whilst the Market Day extras remained, only two daily trains survived, morning and mid-evening.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby July 1923 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|July 1923 Railway timetable]]\n\nA \"Farewell\" railtour ran on 22 April 1960 using two brake vans.<ref>[https://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/60s/600422bv.html Special train at Cawood] ''Six Bells Junction''</ref><ref>[http://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/111860-d2063/page-2 Special train at Cawood] ''RMweb''</ref> The line closed on 2 May 1960.{{sfn|Hoole|1986|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=48}}{{sfn|Railway Magazine|1960|p=289}}The very last train, sent out to collect a stranded van and Cawood station's office equipment, ran on 23 May 1960, hauled by a diesel shunter.

The line was connected to the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER) at its southern end.{{sfn|Conolly|1998|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Jowett|1989|loc=Map 52}}\n\n==The station buildings==\nThe line originally had three stations, {{rws|Selby (Brayton Gates)}}, Wistow and {{rws|Cawood}}. The Brayton Gates terminus was temporary and probably wooden. It closed in 1904 when trains were diverted to the NER's main {{rws|Selby}} station. Cawood's and Wistow's permanent, brick-built station buildings were similar, but clearly differed from the NER's typical rural station. The main difference between the two was that Wistow station building stood alongside the platform, parallel to the track, whilst the Cawood building stood at right angles to it.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=33}} In 1899 the company obtained parliamentary approval to build an extension to [[Church Fenton]]; this never happened, but had it done so the Cawood station building would have had to be demolished or bipassed.\n\nWistow station's passenger provision was unexceptional for a small rural station in a medium-sized village with a rural hinterland. The goods provision was more generous, in particular it featured a long loading platform of varying height to facilitate loading and unloading, especially during the \"Campaign\", i.e. harvest period for crops such as potatoes and beet. \"Campaigns\" could lead to trains of 40 wagons, especially before the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Station masters==\nWistow had two [[station masters]] in its first three years - Messrs Hawmby and Bains. Mr Bailey then took charge until he retired about 1936. Mr Harry Oldfield was responsible for both Cawood and Wistow from then until closure.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}}\n\n==The line and traffic==\nThe line had an exceptionally low [[route availability]] of \"two\". Operators could easily supply very light goods engines which did not need [[Railway brake#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]], but had precious few very light passenger locomotives. The founding company hired a loco - \"Cawood\" - and two coaches specifically for the job. When the NER took over they modified at least one steam locomotive for the line. In the Edwardian period the NER developed a pioneering pair of [[1903 Petrol Electric Autocar|Petrol-electric Autocars]] which were sent to Selby in 1908 to run the Cawood service, among others.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=24}}\n\nThe autocars ceased working the line in the early 1920s, when it reverted to steam haulage, with trains composed of a single \"Bogie Brake third\" coach worked by a [[NER Class E]] [[0-6-0T]] or, occasionally, [[NER Bogie Tank Passenger|BTP]] [[0-4-4T]] No. 189.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=26}}\n\nOn 9 July 1923 a quite different form of [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion-powered]] provision was deployed on some services in the form of the unique \"Leyland\" petrol railbus, a converted 26-seater NER road bus of conventional appearance for the period.<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/IC/ner_petrol_bus.php The LNER petrol rail bus] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> This ran a wide-ranging diagram including the Cawood branch{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=48}} which came to a sudden end on 11 November 1926 when the railbus was destroyed by fire while refuelling at Selby.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=9, 11 & 26-27}}\n\nOn 1 May 1928 Selby received its first [[British steam railcars#Sentinel\u2013Cammell|Sentinel steam railcars]].{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=}}<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/Railcar/sentinel.php The LNER Sentinel Railcars] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> No. 220 \"Water Witch\" may have been the first to work to Cawood, but it was destroyed in a collision near Doncaster on 9 June 1929. Better remembered were two similar cars, No. 225 \"True Blue\" and No. 273 \"Trafalgar\" which worked the branch until the last passenger service on Saturday 30 December 1929.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=12 & 28}} Occasional special passenger trains, such as excursions to [[pantomime]]s in [[Leeds]], used the line until 1946.\n\nAfter the end of passenger services the line went into steady decline in the face of road competition, which accelerated after the [[Second World war]]. A handful of ancient [[0-6-0T]]s were regularly in charge, notably [[LNER Class J71|J71]]s 68285 and 68286 and veteran \"Ironclad\" [[LNER Class J77|J77]] 68406, with a [[LNER Class J72|J72]] appearing more often in the late 1950s. Selby locoshed closed in September 1959, after which the occasional \"flyweight\" freights were usually hauled by a [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03 diesel shunter]].{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=5 & 27-28}}\n\n==Passenger services==\nThe line's initial passenger timetable provided five trains a day, Monday to Saturday, plying between \"Selby\" (i.e. Selby (Brayton Gates)) Wistow and Cawood. The journey time was 17 minutes.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}} By July 1899 the timings had been adjusted and one train had been removed on Tuesdays to Saturdays. On Monday - Selby's Market Day - an extra train was provided out and back mid-morning and an extra from Brayton Gates at teatime, which returned empty.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=17-18}} By 1910 the unbalanced teatime Market Train had been withdrawn and timings had been adjusted, but the pattern of four a day plus a Market Day extra remained, with the added benefit that the first train from Cawood in the morning ran through to York. The journey time remained 17 minutes despite the extra mile to reach Selby's main station instead of Brayton Gates.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby April 1910 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|April 1910 Railway timetable]]\n\nBy 1914 there were two Market Day extras and four daily trains,{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=46}} but by 1923, whilst the Market Day extras remained, only two daily trains survived, morning and mid-evening.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby July 1923 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|July 1923 Railway timetable]]\n\nA \"Farewell\" railtour ran on 22 April 1960 using two brake vans.<ref>[https://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/60s/600422bv.html Special train at Cawood] ''Six Bells Junction''</ref><ref>[http://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/111860-d2063/page-2 Special train at Cawood] ''RMweb''</ref>{{sfn|Chapman|2002|pp=57-58}} The line closed on 2 May 1960.{{sfn|Hoole|1986|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=48}}{{sfn|Railway Magazine|1960|p=289}}The very last train, sent out to collect a stranded van and Cawood station's office equipment, ran on 23 May 1960, hauled by a diesel shunter.

trip.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=19}}\n\n==After closure==\nThe track was lifted and the Selby Dam bridge was demolished by contractors in 1961, using road vehicles.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=30}} Cawood station

The line was connected to the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER) at its southern end.{{sfn|Conolly|1998|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 21}}{{sfn|Jowett|1989|loc=Map 52}}\n\n==The station buildings==\nThe line originally had three stations, {{rws|Selby (Brayton Gates)}}, {{rws|Wistow}} and Cawood. The Brayton Gates terminus was temporary and probably wooden. It closed in 1904 when trains were diverted to the NER's main {{rws|Selby}} station. Cawood's and Wistow's permanent, brick-built station buildings were similar, but clearly differed from the NER's typical rural station. The main difference between the two was that Wistow station building stood alongside the platform, parallel to the track, whilst the Cawood building stood at right angles to it.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=33}} In 1899 the company obtained parliamentary approval to build an extension to [[Church Fenton]]; this never happened, but had it done so the Cawood station building would have had to be demolished or bipassed.\n\nCawood station's passenger provision was unexceptional for a small rural station in a medium-sized village with a rural hinterland. The goods provision was more generous, in particular it featured a long loading platform of varying height to facilitate loading and unloading, especially during the \"Campaign\", i.e. harvest period for crops such as potatoes and beet. \"Campaigns\" could lead to trains of 40 wagons, especially before the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Station masters==\nCawood had three [[station masters]] over its 62 years, Mr Dale, followed by Mr Higgins and finally Mr Harry Oldfield from about 1936 to closure.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}}\n\n==The line and traffic==\nThe line had an exceptionally low [[route availability]] of \"two\". Operators could easily supply very light goods engines which did not need [[Railway brake#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]], but had precious few very light passenger locomotives. The founding company hired a loco - \"Cawood\" - and two coaches specifically for the job. When the NER took over they modified at least one steam locomotive for the line. In the Edwardian period the NER developed a pioneering pair of [[1903 Petrol Electric Autocar|Petrol-electric Autocars]] which were sent to Selby in 1908 to run the Cawood service, among others.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=24}}\n\nThe autocars ceased working the line in the early 1920s, when it reverted to steam haulage, with trains composed of a single \"Bogie Brake third\" coach worked by a [[NER Class E]] [[0-6-0T]] or, occasionally, [[NER Bogie Tank Passenger|BTP]] [[0-4-4T]] No. 189.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=26}}\n\nOn 9 July 1923 a quite different form of [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion-powered]] provision was deployed on some services in the form of the unique \"Leyland\" petrol railbus, a converted 26-seater NER road bus of conventional appearance for the period.<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/IC/ner_petrol_bus.php The LNER petrol rail bus] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref>{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=21}} This ran a wide-ranging diagram including the Cawood branch{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=48}} which came to a sudden end on 11 November 1926 when the railbus was destroyed by fire while refuelling at Selby.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=9, 11 & 26-27}}\n\nOn 1 May 1928 Selby received its first [[British steam railcars#Sentinel\u2013Cammell|Sentinel steam railcars]].{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=66}}<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/Railcar/sentinel.php The LNER Sentinel Railcars] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> No. 220 \"Water Witch\" may have been the first to work to Cawood, but it was destroyed in a collision near Doncaster on 9 June 1929. Better remembered were two similar cars, No. 225 \"True Blue\" and No. 273 \"Trafalgar\" which worked the branch until the last passenger service on Saturday 30 December 1929.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=12 & 28}} Occasional special passenger trains, such as excursions to [[pantomime]]s in [[Leeds]], used the line until 1946.\n\nAfter the end of passenger services the line went into steady decline in the face of road competition, which accelerated after the [[Second World war]]. A handful of ancient [[0-6-0T]]s were regularly in charge, notably [[LNER Class J71|J71]]s 68285 and 68286 and veteran \"Ironclad\" [[LNER Class J77|J77]] 68406, with a [[LNER Class J72|J72]] appearing more often in the late 1950s. Selby locoshed closed in September 1959, after which the occasional \"flyweight\" freights were usually hauled by a [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03 diesel shunter]].{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=5 & 27-28}}\n\n==Passenger services==\nThe line's initial passenger timetable provided five trains a day, Monday to Saturday, plying between \"Selby\" (i.e. Selby (Brayton Gates)) Wistow and Cawood. The journey time was 17 minutes.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}} By July 1899 the timings had been adjusted and one train had been removed on Tuesdays to Saturdays. On Monday - Selby's Market Day - an extra train was provided out and back mid-morning and an extra from Brayton Gates at teatime, which returned empty.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=17-18}} By 1910 the unbalanced teatime Market Train had been withdrawn and timings had been adjusted, but the pattern of four a day plus a Market Day extra remained, with the added benefit that the first train from Cawood in the morning ran through to York. The journey time remained 17 minutes despite the extra mile to reach Selby's main station instead of Brayton Gates.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby April 1910 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|April 1910 Railway timetable]]\n\nBy 1914 there were two Market Day extras and four daily trains,{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=46}} but by 1923, whilst the Market Day extras remained, only two daily trains survived, morning and mid-evening.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby July 1923 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|July 1923 Railway timetable]]\n\nA \"Farewell\" railtour ran on 22 April 1960 using two brake vans.<ref>[https://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/60s/600422bv.html Special train at Cawood] ''Six Bells Junction''</ref><ref>[http://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/111860-d2063/page-2 Special train at Cawood] ''RMweb''</ref>{{sfn|Chapman|2002|pp=57-58}}\n\nThe line closed on 2 May 1960.{{sfn|Hoole|1986|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=48}}{{sfn|Railway Magazine|1960|p=289}}The very last train, sent out to collect a stranded van and Cawood station's office equipment, ran on 23 May 1960, hauled by a diesel shunter.

trip.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=19}}\n\n==After closure==\nThe track was lifted and the Selby Dam bridge was demolished by contractors in 1961, using road vehicles.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=30}} Cawood station

The goods provision was more generous, in particular it featured a long loading platform of varying height to facilitate loading and unloading, especially during the \"Campaign\", i.e. harvest period for crops such as potatoes and beet. \"Campaigns\" could lead to trains of 40 wagons, especially before the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Station masters==\nCawood had three [[station masters]] over its 62 years, Mr Dale, followed by Mr Higgins and finally Mr Harry Oldfield from about 1936 to closure.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}}\n\n==The line and traffic==\nThe line had an exceptionally low [[route availability]] of \"two\". Operators could easily supply very light goods engines which did not need [[Railway brake#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]], but had precious few very light passenger locomotives. The founding company hired a loco - \"Cawood\" - and two coaches specifically for the job. When the NER took over they modified at least one steam locomotive for the line. In the Edwardian period the NER developed a pioneering pair of [[1903 Petrol Electric Autocar|Petrol-electric Autocars]] which were sent to Selby in 1908 to run the Cawood service, among others.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=24}}\n\nThe autocars ceased working the line in the early 1920s, when it reverted to steam haulage, with trains composed of a single \"Bogie Brake third\" coach worked by a [[NER Class E]] [[0-6-0T]] or, occasionally, [[NER Bogie Tank Passenger|BTP]] [[0-4-4T]] No. 189.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=26}}\n\nOn 9 July 1923 a quite different form of [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion-powered]] provision was deployed on some services in the form of the unique \"Leyland\" petrol railbus, a converted 26-seater NER road bus of conventional appearance for the period.<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/IC/ner_petrol_bus.php The LNER petrol rail bus] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref>{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=21}} This ran a wide-ranging diagram including the Cawood branch{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=48}} which came to a sudden end on 11 November 1926 when the railbus was destroyed by fire while refuelling at Selby.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=9, 11 & 26-27}}\n\nOn 1 May 1928 Selby received its first [[British steam railcars#Sentinel\u2013Cammell|Sentinel steam railcars]].{{sfn|Bairstow|1990|p=66}}<ref>[https://www.lner.info/locos/Railcar/sentinel.php The LNER Sentinel Railcars] ''LNER Encyclopaedia''</ref> No. 220 \"Water Witch\" may have been the first to work to Cawood, but it was destroyed in a collision near Doncaster on 9 June 1929. Better remembered were two similar cars, No. 225 \"True Blue\" and No. 273 \"Trafalgar\" which worked the branch until the last passenger service on Saturday 30 December 1929.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=12 & 28}} Occasional special passenger trains, such as excursions to [[pantomime]]s in [[Leeds]], used the line until 1946.\n\nAfter the end of passenger services the line went into steady decline in the face of road competition, which accelerated after the [[Second World war]]. A handful of ancient [[0-6-0T]]s were regularly in charge, notably [[LNER Class J71|J71]]s 68285 and 68286 and veteran \"Ironclad\" [[LNER Class J77|J77]] 68406, with a [[LNER Class J72|J72]] appearing more often in the late 1950s. Selby locoshed closed in September 1959, after which the occasional \"flyweight\" freights were usually hauled by a [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03 diesel shunter]].{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=5 & 27-28}}\n\n==Passenger services==\nThe line's initial passenger timetable provided five trains a day, Monday to Saturday, plying between \"Selby\" (i.e. Selby (Brayton Gates)) Wistow and Cawood. The journey time was 17 minutes.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=17}} By July 1899 the timings had been adjusted and one train had been removed on Tuesdays to Saturdays. On Monday - Selby's Market Day - an extra train was provided out and back mid-morning and an extra from Brayton Gates at teatime, which returned empty.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|pp=17-18}} By 1910 the unbalanced teatime Market Train had been withdrawn and timings had been adjusted, but the pattern of four a day plus a Market Day extra remained, with the added benefit that the first train from Cawood in the morning ran through to York. The journey time remained 17 minutes despite the extra mile to reach Selby's main station instead of Brayton Gates.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby April 1910 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|April 1910 Railway timetable]]\n\nBy 1914 there were two Market Day extras and four daily trains,{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=46}} but by 1923, whilst the Market Day extras remained, only two daily trains survived, morning and mid-evening.\n[[File:Cawood to Selby July 1923 Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|centre|July 1923 Railway timetable]]\n\nA \"Farewell\" railtour ran on 22 April 1960 using two brake vans.<ref>[https://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/60s/600422bv.html Special train at Cawood] ''Six Bells Junction''</ref><ref>[http://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/111860-d2063/page-2 Special train at Cawood] ''RMweb''</ref>{{sfn|Chapman|2002|pp=57-58}}\n\nThe line closed on 2 May 1960.{{sfn|Hoole|1986|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Barnett|1992|p=48}}{{sfn|Railway Magazine|1960|p=289}}The very last train, sent out to collect a stranded van and Cawood station's office equipment, ran on 23 May 1960, hauled by a diesel shunter. As a boy, Mr John Woodall had travelled on the first train in 1898, [[British Rail|British Railways]] agreed to his request to travel in the guard's van of this final trip.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=19}}\n\n==After closure==\nThe track was lifted and the Selby Dam bridge was demolished by contractors in 1961, using road vehicles.{{sfn|Hartley|1973|p=30}} Cawood station

The Aldobrandeschi were the most powerful feudataries of southern Tuscany for more than four centuries, disappearing in 1312 when Margherita, son of Ildibrandino, died without male heirs. His daughter Adelaide married to Romano di Gentile [[Orsini (family)|Orsini]], who added the city to the family fiefs.\n\nThe county of [[Pitigliano]]-Sorano fought against the [[Republic of Siena]], but was forced to accept its suzerainty from 1417. It regained a full independence in 1556, when the latter was annexed to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Duchy of Tuscany]]. The fortress, due to its strategic position, was frequently attacked; it was also the seat of fratricidal fights between the Orsini. In 1604, with the death of Alessandro di Bertoldo, it became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nIt became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1860.\n\n==Main sights==\n*''Rocca degli Orsini'' (Orsini castle), built in the 14th century but totally renovated by Niccol\u00f2 IV Orsini in 1552.

The only semantically correct way to refer to the K\u0151b\u00e1nya quarry sites is to use the [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]] form ''k\u0151b\u00e1nyai k\u0151b\u00e1ny\u00e1k'' (literally, \"the quarries of Quarry\").\n\n== History ==\n=== Limestone mining ===\n\nThe tunnel system originated as an underground [[limestone]] quarry in an area which was known as ''K\u0151\u00e9r'' (roughly \"Stone Vein\") in present-day K\u0151b\u00e1nya.<ref name=\"AKobanyaiPincerendszer\" />{{rp|1}}<ref name=\"IndexKobanya\" /> The area's name appears as ''Kewer'' (or ''K\u0151\u00e9r'' in [[Hungarian orthography|modern Hungarian orthography]]) in a [[royal charter]] written by [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]]<ref name=\"KobanyaKP\" />{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"AKobanyaiPincerendszer\" />{{rp|1}}<ref name=\"KobanyaVaroskalauz2014\">{{cite web |last1= Szatm\u00e1ri |first1= R\u00e9ka |title= K\u0151b\u00e1nya V\u00e1roskalauz 2014 |url= http://www.varoskalauz.com/downloads/budapest/kobanya_2014.pdf |website= V\u00e1roskalauz.com |publisher= Activity Guide |accessdate= 16 Aug 2017 |date= 2014 |language= Hungarian, English |trans-title= K\u0151b\u00e1nya City Guide 2014 }}</ref>{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"OziriszFoldjen\">{{cite web |last1= Szab\u00f3 |first1= Lambert |title= K\u0151b\u00e1nyai pincerendszer |url= http://ibisz.iif.hu/ozirisz/2016/11/17/kobanyai_pincerendszer/ |website= Ozirisz F\u00f6ldj\u00e9n |publisher= [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] |accessdate= 16 Aug 2017 |date= 17 Nov 2016 |language= Hungarian |trans-title= K\u0151b\u00e1nya Cellar System }}</ref> (in which he donated a piece of land to the city of [[Pest (historic city)|Pest]]),<ref name=\"KobanyaVaroskalauz2014\" />{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"LBP\" /> a name of a {{convert|147|m|ft|abbr=on}} high hill.<ref name=\"KobanyaKP\" />{{rp|8}} This evidence suggests that the area was used as a source of limestone from at least the 13th century,<ref name=\"KobanyaKP\" />{{rp|8}} but it is likely that the area provided limestone even in the [[Ancient history|Antiquity]].<ref name=\"MNOKobanya\" /> The exact variant is known as [[List of types of limestone|Sarmatian limestone]].,<ref name=\"AKobanyaiPincerendszer\" />{{rp|1}} which was formed from the deposits of the [[Pannonian Sea]] in the Central European [[Sarmatian (stage)|Sarmatian]] stage of the upper-middle [[Miocene]], approximately 11.6\u201312.7 million years ago.\n\n[[File:Dr\u00e9her Antal.jpg|thumb|left|Anton Dreher Sr. (''id.

A highly skilled work of Jewish silversmiths, it is a testimony of exquisite craftsmanship, requiring painstaking work and a developed artistic sense, expressed by the harmonious and aesthetic blend of its many parts. The ''labbe'' is a popular piece of jewelry among Jewish and Muslim women alike. In Arabic, the name ''labbe'' indicates the sunken place beneath the [[Adam's apple]] on the neck, where it is worn.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" />\n\n''Labbe'' necklaces made of applied [[filigree]], being open and airy like the interlaced net of a spider\u2019s web, became more popular during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]] of Yemen, in the mid-19th century, and were given the name ''labbat \u0161abek'' in [[Sana'a]], after its technique. Until then, most were prepared by using casting techniques, and embossing and fashioning from solid pieces.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> Only a few were made from silver.<ref>\u1e24ibsh\u016bsh notes: \u201cGenerally speaking, items wrought in silver were very few, and no one asked for them except the royalty and the illustrious men of the kingdom. Tribesmen and most of the public were content with having jewelry made of iron, copper, lead and glass beads... Nowadays, silver products have become more plenteous than the copper and iron once used in the past.\u201d (see \u1e24ibsh\u016bsh 1983, pp. 86\u201387).</ref> The ''labbe'' is traditionally made from dozens of components arranged in horizontal rows, or storeys (projected lines). The top row forms the base of the necklace, with connecting parts (usually serial pendants) densely strung upon a cotton or silk thread, extending downwards lengthwise, in identical columns and which form the horizontal lines. It consists of one row \u2013 or more \u2013 of parts, whose shapes are varied: diamond-shaped [[rhomboid]]s, squares and rectangles, round beads or [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]]. Most contain smooth plates of metal, in circular and diamond-shaped ([[rhombus]]) forms, and are studded with jewels called in Arabic ''zihreh'', meaning, [[pearls]], [[amber]], [[corals]] and [[colored glass]].<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> The artisans would also lavishly apply decorations made from small, rounded [[Granulation (jewellery)|silver granules]]. Coin pendants are characteristic of the ''labbe'' necklaces worn by villagers. Large ''labbe'' necklaces may have as many as thirty or more rows.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" />\n[[File:Necklace (Pierre-Alain Ferrazzini) for The Israel Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Labbe Shabek'' (Great Necklace) from Sana'a, Yemen - 19th-20th century]]\nThe components are interconnected by coiled rings in the vertical and horizontal rows. The location of the items in the vertical lines are complementary to each other, as well as uniform along all the vertical lines. In the vertical lines there are four to eight items that are connected one beneath the other by a metal wire in the shape of the figure-eight, called in Arabic ''metham\u0101na'', meaning \"eight.\" For most, the edges of the base end with either triangles or cones. Occasionally, motifs used in its base were also incorporated in the body of the ''labbe'', particularly the rosette, the lozenge and the round bead. ''Labbe'' necklaces worn by Muslim women typically differed from those worn by Jewish women, insofar that they lacked a base.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> In ''labbe'' necklaces typically worn by Muslim women in central Yemen, they made use of convex components, or [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that were round and belly-shaped, resembling leaves or barley-grains ([[Arabic|Arabic:]] ''aqr\u0101\u1e6d she\u2018iriy\u0101t''). In some places, it was common to attach a piece of woven cloth on the back of the ''labbe'', like the inner lining of garments, to protect the clothes and the embroidery, as well as the skin, from abrasions.<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Q\u0101fi\u1e25, Y.]] (1982a), pp. 190, 192 Photo 24; Colyer-Ross (1981), p. 108; Janata (1989), Photo 61 on p. 136, the text 38-E on p. 186; Heimberg (1986),  p. 84; Untracht (1982), p. 174; Sergeant and Lewcock (1983), p. 540; Muchawsky-Schnapper, Ester (2000), pp. 128-129</ref>\n[[File:Amulet case.jpg|thumb|Silver amulet case with pendants]]\n\n===Techniques===\nWhile silver granules can also be made by dropping melted silver into cold water, in Yemen, most silversmiths used a different technique. The silver granules (''\u0161a\u1e0fir'') were prepared from a silver wire cut into small pieces, which were then concealed within ashes that were heated by a flame, during which heating process they obtained their round shape. From them, they prepared ''masb\u016b\u02bb\u0101t'' \u2013 the rose-like cluster consisting of seven granules, and ''matis\u016b\u02bb\u0101t'' \u2013 the diamond-shaped rhombus consisting of nine granules, the mulberry beads known as ''t\u016bt'' for the choker necklace (''ma\u02bbnaqeh''), among other things. This process forms granules, or \"droplets\" that are perfectly round. These were soldered onto the piece of jewellery as desired.\n\nSilver wires were made in Yemen by pouring melted silver into a finger-length mold made from special earth and which was shaped like a tube.<ref>Van Praag, Esther (2007), p. 100</ref> A substance similar to borax (known as ''tinkar'' in the Yemenite dialect of Arabic - and otherwise known as the \"glue of the silversmith\") was solely used in Yemen for the purpose of soldering in order to bind together two separate silver pieces (especially for applying fine and delicate work, such as granules, to a silver plate). [[Cadmium]] was not used in Yemen for this purpose at all. A different substance was used when soldering wires to a silver plate.\n\nIn recent years in Yemen, the silversmith bought all these materials (granules, wires and plates) pre-manufactured.\n====Neillo technique====\nThe relative composition of different metals used in making a [[niello]]-bracelet in Yemen varied, although a popular composite consisted of the following: For every 10 [[grammes]] of fine [[red copper]] ([[Arabic]]: ''\u1e6dab''), they added 20 grammes of [[Graphite|black lead]] ([[Arabic]]: ''ra\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 aswad''), 1 gram of sterling silver ([[Judeo-Arabic]]: ''\u1e6doh\u014dr''), 3 grammes of [[sulphur]] ([[Arabic]]: ''kabrit''), and 3/4 gramme of [[Borax|crude borax]] ([[Arabic]]: ''tinkar'') (for definition of this term, see ''infra'').<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 91</ref>\n\nThe heaviest metals were first put inside the [[crucible]] ([[Arabic]]: ''b\u016b\u1e6da'') for melting, followed by the lighter metals: silver and copper, brought to a boiling state, after which the craftsman added lead, followed by sulphur. Once the sulphur is added to the mixture and stirred, the craftsman then poured the molten metal into a flat [[Molding (process)|mold]] ([[Arabic]]: ''mafraj'') made of [[molding sand]] (a process known as [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]]), which was done before the sulphur burnt out.<ref name= \"YQafih1982\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 90</ref> The mold was made with many sunken, groove-like impressions and insertable slots running lengthwise where the craftsman poured the molten metal to form either rods (wires) or plaques.<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982a), p. 234 (s.v. '''\u05de\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2''')</ref> Experienced silversmiths in Yemen would cast the desired shape by first adding ''tinkar'' (a solder made of crude borax) into a mold where there was powdered sulphur.<ref name= \"YQafih1982\" /> The ''tinkar'', in this case, was first pounded to a powder and mixed together with a finely ground niello-metal piece after it had solidified, which powdered elements were added to the mold before casting the molten metal. This prevented the appearance of a hardened, membranous film on the surface of the finished object due to the heat.\n\nAfter casting in the mold used for making rectangular-shaped ingots, they removed the metal after it had solidified, and began to work it into a flat sheet of silver by pounding with a [[Planishing hammer|wooden mallet]], until it was perfectly flat and had a conformity in its thickness, based on eyesight and feel.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 92</ref> In Yemen, there were no [[micrometer]]s. The flat sheet of silver was then cut with [[snips]] to its desired size, after which it was rolled over the rounded end of an iron implement (having one end that was rounded), similar to a [[ball-peen hammer]] ([[Arabic]]: ''rib\u0101l''), until it was fashioned into what resembled a hollow pipe.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" /> Within its center, they cast molten lead, or else a different substance known as ''q\u0101r'', made from what is left after burning wood, and which had the same malleability as lead.<ref>Although lead is a soft metal and malleable, according to Rabbi Qafih, the ''q\u0101r'' substance used in filling the cavity was preferable over lead, since removing it from the cavity was easier to do, whereas with lead if the silver piece were to be overheated when extracting the lead, the craftsman ran the risk of damaging the surface of the silver bracelet by the molten lead, resulting in a perforated product. [[Mishnah]] ''[[Keilim|Kelim]]'' 10:2 mentions the property of lead as being able to tighten a hold on a lid and to support it, but which cannot form a hermetic seal on ceramic-ware lids.</ref> After the pipe has been filled with molten lead and it solidifies, then began the process of slowly bending the silver into the shape of a bracelet.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" />\n\nTo facilitate the easy fashioning of this cylindrical pipe soon-to-be bracelet, the craftsmen would make use of a block of wood, appx. {{convert|30|cm}} in height, {{convert|20|cm}} wide, and {{convert|35|cm}} in length, in which there was a groove measuring in diameter 3 fingerbreadths and which ran clear across the surface of the block of wood, in its entirety, at a depth of ca. {{convert|6|cm}}. The block of wood was made with several of these grooves, in various sizes, some deeper and narrower than the others. Through this groove cut into the surface of the block of wood, the craftsman would pass a wooden rod with which he rounded and bent the bracelet into shape.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" /> He passed the cylindrical pipe through the groove, first at its breadth, and afterwards narrowing it, repeating the process until eventually he was left with the desired shape and the two ends of the cylindrical pipe were brought closer together. After he is left with a smooth bracelet, and where [[welding]] was done from within the bracelet (rather than on its outside), the craftsman marked with charcoal or a pencil the designs he wished to make on the [[niello]] product and forthwith began the process of [[engraving|etching]], making use of variously designed [[Burin (engraving)|burins]], [[chisels]], and [[Gouge (chisel)|gouges]], some flat-tipped, others pointed; some rounded and others made like a pair of compasses, etc.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" />\n\nOnce etching is completed, they removed the lead by lightly heating the bracelet in fire.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 93</ref> After emptying-out the lead, the craftsman then welded the two halves together, at their respective ends, leaving one or two small holes in the bracelet, so that when it was reheated it did not burst due to the accumulation of vapors.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /> The piece was then cleaned-off thoroughly and [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] with finely ground sea-sand that had been sifted ([[Arabic]]: ''ba\u1e6d\u1e25a''), so as not to cause abrasions to the finished product.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /> The sea-sand was kept in an earthenware vessel. In those places where he made designs and wanted them to be highlighted with a blueish-grey hue, he painted the area with the powdered neillo metallic-compounds (consisting of sulphur, copper, silver, and lead), and placed the finished piece over a brazier bearing coals ([[Arabic]]: ''maghmareh'') for heating over a low-heat, to which is attached a pair of [[bellows]] that is used to lightly blow air into the brazier.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /><ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982a), p. 233 (s.v.

The purpose of the ''tinkar'' was to prevent the appearance of a thin film on the surface of the bracelet due to the heat.

When soldering pieces together, he would then take lead (or [[cadmium]]) and silver; he smelted the lead (or cadmium) while fanning the unalloyed silver (\"tohor\"), so that the two pieces adhere together. The molten lead that fell below was sifted with the dried dung. This substance is litharge of silver. Once the substance hardens from the molten lead and silver, and forms into a rock-like substance, he takes it up and chisels away the greyish or blackish stone, leaving only the brown colored stone. He then takes a brittle cloth or pad and washes it in soapy water, allowing it to dry thereafter. Whenever the substance was needed, he would take up the desired quantity and crush it in mortar and pestle. It was pounded until fine, sifted through a sieve, and again pounded. The dust, litharge of silver, served as an antiperspirant, and also acts to fill-up cavities caused by ulcers and to soften tumours.

A highly skilled work of Jewish silversmiths, it is a testimony of exquisite craftsmanship, requiring painstaking work and a developed artistic sense, expressed by the harmonious and aesthetic blend of its many parts. The ''labbe'' is a popular piece of jewelry among Jewish and Muslim women alike. In Arabic, the name ''labbe'' indicates the sunken place beneath the [[Adam's apple]] on the neck, where it is worn.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" />\n\n''Labbe'' necklaces made of applied [[filigree]], being open and airy like the interlaced net of a spider\u2019s web, became more popular during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]] of Yemen, in the mid-19th century, and were given the name ''labbat \u0161abek'' in [[Sana'a]], after its technique. Until then, most were prepared by using casting techniques, and embossing and fashioning from solid pieces.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> Only a few were made from silver.<ref>\u1e24ibsh\u016bsh notes: \u201cGenerally speaking, items wrought in silver were very few, and no one asked for them except the royalty and the illustrious men of the kingdom. Tribesmen and most of the public were content with having jewelry made of iron, copper, lead and glass beads... Nowadays, silver products have become more plenteous than the copper and iron once used in the past.\u201d (see \u1e24ibsh\u016bsh 1983, pp. 86\u201387).</ref> The ''labbe'' is traditionally made from dozens of components arranged in horizontal rows, or storeys (projected lines). The top row forms the base of the necklace, with connecting parts (usually serial pendants) densely strung upon a cotton or silk thread, extending downwards lengthwise, in identical columns and which form the horizontal lines. It consists of one row \u2013 or more \u2013 of parts, whose shapes are varied: diamond-shaped [[rhomboid]]s, squares and rectangles, round beads or [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]]. Most contain smooth plates of metal, in circular and diamond-shaped ([[rhombus]]) forms, and are studded with jewels called in Arabic ''zihreh'', meaning, [[pearls]], [[amber]], [[corals]] and [[colored glass]].<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> The artisans would also lavishly apply decorations made from small, rounded [[Granulation (jewellery)|silver granules]]. Coin pendants are characteristic of the ''labbe'' necklaces worn by villagers. Large ''labbe'' necklaces may have as many as thirty or more rows.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" />\n[[File:Necklace (Pierre-Alain Ferrazzini) for The Israel Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Labbe Shabek'' (Great Necklace) from Sana'a, Yemen - 19th-20th century]]\nThe components are interconnected by coiled rings in the vertical and horizontal rows. The location of the items in the vertical lines are complementary to each other, as well as uniform along all the vertical lines. In the vertical lines there are four to eight items that are connected one beneath the other by a metal wire in the shape of the figure-eight, called in Arabic ''metham\u0101na'', meaning \"eight.\" For most, the edges of the base end with either triangles or cones. Occasionally, motifs used in its base were also incorporated in the body of the ''labbe'', particularly the rosette, the lozenge and the round bead. ''Labbe'' necklaces worn by Muslim women typically differed from those worn by Jewish women, insofar that they lacked a base.<ref name=\"AvivaKlein-Franke2008\" /> In ''labbe'' necklaces typically worn by Muslim women in central Yemen, they made use of convex components, or [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that were round and belly-shaped, resembling leaves or barley-grains ([[Arabic|Arabic:]] ''aqr\u0101\u1e6d she\u2018iriy\u0101t''). In some places, it was common to attach a piece of woven cloth on the back of the ''labbe'', like the inner lining of garments, to protect the clothes and the embroidery, as well as the skin, from abrasions.<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Q\u0101fi\u1e25, Y.]] (1982a), pp. 190, 192 Photo 24; Colyer-Ross (1981), p. 108; Janata (1989), Photo 61 on p. 136, the text 38-E on p. 186; Heimberg (1986),  p. 84; Untracht (1982), p. 174; Sergeant and Lewcock (1983), p. 540; Muchawsky-Schnapper, Ester (2000), pp. 128-129</ref>\n[[File:Amulet case.jpg|thumb|Silver amulet case with pendants]]\n\n===Techniques===\nWhile silver granules can also be made by dropping melted silver into cold water, in Yemen, most silversmiths used a different technique. The silver granules (''\u0161a\u1e0fir'') were prepared from a silver wire cut into small pieces, which were then concealed within ashes that were heated by a flame, during which heating process they obtained their round shape. From them, they prepared ''masb\u016b\u02bb\u0101t'' \u2013 the rose-like cluster consisting of seven granules, and ''matis\u016b\u02bb\u0101t'' \u2013 the diamond-shaped rhombus consisting of nine granules, the mulberry beads known as ''t\u016bt'' for the choker necklace (''ma\u02bbnaqeh''), among other things. This process forms granules, or \"droplets\" that are perfectly round. These were soldered onto the piece of jewellery as desired.\n\nSilver wires were made in Yemen by pouring melted silver into a finger-length mold made from special earth and which was shaped like a tube.<ref>Van Praag, Esther (2007), p. 100</ref> A substance similar to borax (known as ''tinkar'' in the Yemenite dialect of Arabic - and otherwise known as the \"glue of the silversmith\") was solely used in Yemen for the purpose of soldering in order to bind together two separate silver pieces (especially for applying fine and delicate work, such as granules, to a silver plate). [[Cadmium]] was not used in Yemen for this purpose at all. A different substance was used when soldering wires to a silver plate.\n\nIn recent years in Yemen, the silversmith bought all these materials (granules, wires and plates) pre-manufactured.\n====Neillo technique====\nThe relative composition of different metals used in making a [[niello]]-bracelet in Yemen varied, although a popular composite consisted of the following: For every 10 [[grammes]] of fine [[red copper]] ([[Arabic]]: ''\u1e6dab''), they added 20 grammes of [[Graphite|black lead]] ([[Arabic]]: ''ra\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 aswad''), 1 gram of sterling silver ([[Judeo-Arabic]]: ''\u1e6doh\u014dr''), 3 grammes of [[sulphur]] ([[Arabic]]: ''kabrit''), and 3/4 gramme of [[Borax|crude borax]] ([[Arabic]]: ''tinkar'') (for definition of this term, see ''infra'').<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 91</ref>\n\nThe heaviest metals were first put inside the [[crucible]] ([[Arabic]]: ''b\u016b\u1e6da'') for melting, followed by the lighter metals: silver and copper, brought to a boiling state, after which the craftsman added lead, followed by sulphur. Once the sulphur is added to the mixture and stirred, the craftsman then poured the molten metal into a flat [[mold]] ([[Arabic]]: ''mafraj'') made of [[molding sand]] (a process known as [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]]), which was done before the sulphur burnt out.<ref name= \"YQafih1982\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 90</ref> The mold was made with many sunken, groove-like impressions and insertable slots running lengthwise where the craftsman poured the molten metal to form either rods (wires) or plaques.<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982a), p. 234 (s.v. '''\u05de\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2''')</ref> Experienced silversmiths in Yemen would cast the desired shape by first adding ''tinkar'' (a solder made of crude borax) into a mold where there was powdered sulphur.<ref name= \"YQafih1982\" /> The ''tinkar'', in this case, was first pounded to a powder and mixed together with a finely ground niello-metal piece after it had solidified, which powdered elements were added to the mold before casting the molten metal. This prevented the appearance of a hardened, membranous film on the surface of the finished object due to the heat.\n\nAfter casting in the mold used for making rectangular-shaped ingots, they removed the metal after it had solidified, and began to work it into a flat sheet of silver by pounding with a [[Planishing hammer|wooden mallet]], until it was perfectly flat and had a conformity in its thickness, based on eyesight and feel.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 92</ref> In Yemen, there were no [[micrometer]]s. The flat sheet of silver was then cut with [[snips]] to its desired size, after which it was rolled over the rounded end of an iron implement (having one end that was rounded), similar to a [[ball-peen hammer]] ([[Arabic]]: ''rib\u0101l''), until it was fashioned into what resembled a hollow pipe.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" /> Within its center, they cast molten lead, or else a different substance known as ''q\u0101r'', made from what is left after burning wood, and which had the same malleability as lead.<ref>Although lead is a soft metal and malleable, according to Rabbi Qafih, the ''q\u0101r'' substance used in filling the cavity was preferable over lead, since removing it from the cavity was easier to do, whereas with lead if the silver piece were to be overheated when extracting the lead, the craftsman ran the risk of damaging the surface of the silver bracelet by the molten lead, resulting in a perforated product. [[Mishnah]] ''[[Keilim|Kelim]]'' 10:2 mentions the property of lead as being able to tighten a hold on a lid and to support it, but which cannot form a hermetic seal on ceramic-ware lids.</ref> After the pipe has been filled with molten lead and it solidifies, then began the process of slowly bending the silver into the shape of a bracelet.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" />\n\nTo facilitate the easy fashioning of this cylindrical pipe soon-to-be bracelet, the craftsmen would make use of a block of wood, appx. {{convert|30|cm}} in height, {{convert|20|cm}} wide, and {{convert|35|cm}} in length, in which there was a groove measuring in diameter 3 fingerbreadths and which ran clear across the surface of the block of wood, in its entirety, at a depth of ca. {{convert|6|cm}}. The block of wood was made with several of these grooves, in various sizes, some deeper and narrower than the others. Through this groove cut into the surface of the block of wood, the craftsman would pass a wooden rod with which he rounded and bent the bracelet into shape.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" /> He passed the cylindrical pipe through the groove, first at its breadth, and afterwards narrowing it, repeating the process until eventually he was left with the desired shape and the two ends of the cylindrical pipe were brought closer together. After he is left with a smooth bracelet, and where [[welding]] was done from within the bracelet (rather than on its outside), the craftsman marked with charcoal or a pencil the designs he wished to make on the [[niello]] product and forthwith began the process of [[engraving|etching]], making use of variously designed [[Burin (engraving)|burins]], [[chisels]], and [[Gouge (chisel)|gouges]], some flat-tipped, others pointed; some rounded and others made like a pair of compasses, etc.<ref name= \"YosefQafih1982b\" />\n\nOnce etching is completed, they removed the lead by lightly heating the bracelet in fire.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\">[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982b), p. 93</ref> After emptying-out the lead, the craftsman then welded the two halves together, at their respective ends, leaving one or two small holes in the bracelet, so that when it was reheated it did not burst due to the accumulation of vapors.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /> The piece was then cleaned-off thoroughly and [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] with finely ground sea-sand that had been sifted ([[Arabic]]: ''ba\u1e6d\u1e25a''), so as not to cause abrasions to the finished product.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /> The sea-sand was kept in an earthenware vessel. In those places where he made designs and wanted them to be highlighted with a blueish-grey hue, he painted the area with the powdered neillo metallic-compounds (consisting of sulphur, copper, silver, and lead), and placed the finished piece over a brazier bearing coals ([[Arabic]]: ''maghmareh'') for heating over a low-heat, to which is attached a pair of [[bellows]] that is used to lightly blow air into the brazier.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" /><ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982a), p. 233 (s.v. '''\u05de\u05d2\u05de\u05e8\u05d4''')</ref> Over the brazier there is laid a grid-iron to support the bracelet. During this process, the bracelet is turned over the fire so as to melt the powdered substance applied to the bracelet. Afterwards, the bracelet is removed from the brazier and allowed to cool, and it is once again burnished with finely ground sea-sand.<ref name= \"YosefQ1982b\" />\n\n==Terminology==\n* ''\u1e6doh\u014dr'' = sterling silver (usually obtained by remelting silver coins, those with a silver-content of no less than 85% silver and 15% copper)<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1982a), p. 231</ref>  \n* ''fu\u1e0dah'' = alloyed silver\n* ''tinkar'' = pulver (a [[soldering]] powder made from [[Borax|crude borax]])<ref>Formerly, when soldering, they would first apply to the place of connection a  pulver of crude borax, and then apply a smoldering substance (silver and lead), which was then heated. Today, in modern techniques, they use either a thin metal wire which is melted or plate of same substance. The purpose of the ''tinkar'' was to prevent the appearance of a thin film on the surface of the bracelet due to the heat. Without which, the thin membranous film would become hardened on the surface of the jewellery piece ([[Yosef Qafih|Qafih]] 1982:90).</ref>\n* ''chabath'' = [[slag]] that comprises [[Lead monoxide|litharge of silver]] (from the silversmith's refinery)<ref>In Yemen, the method of extraction from the silversmith's refinery was as follows: After collecting the dried dung of cattle and after it was burnt until it becomes like fine powder, it was pounded and placed beneath the place where the silversmith would work the silver. When soldering pieces together, he would then take lead (or [[cadmium]]) and silver; he smelted the lead (or cadmium) while fanning the unalloyed silver (\"tohor\"), so that the two pieces adhere together. The molten lead that fell below was sifted with the dried dung. This substance is litharge of silver. Once the substance hardens from the molten lead and silver, and forms into a rock-like substance, he takes it up and chisels away the greyish or blackish stone, leaving only the brown colored stone. He then takes a brittle cloth or pad and washes it in soapy water, allowing it to dry thereafter. Whenever the substance was needed, he would take up the desired quantity and crush it in mortar and pestle. It was pounded until fine, sifted through a sieve, and again pounded. The dust, litharge of silver, served as an antiperspirant, and also acts to fill-up cavities caused by ulcers and to soften tumours. The ground powder was stored in a small, sealed container.</ref>\n* ''l\u0101z aswad'' = [[niello]]-decorated (also called ''ka\u1e25\u0101l'')\n* ''mshawsaq'' = rhomboids\n* ''fatil'' = twisted silver wire; one wire that is twined from two thin metal wires\n* ''\u1e63om'' = a substance used by the older Yemenites in smelting silver, used primarily in very fine and delicate applications so as not to suffer the silver to melt before it was shaped and applied.\n* ''tikl\u016bl'' = white silver granules\n* ''\u1e63ab'' = the complete casting of a jewellery piece, such as a bracelet\n\n==Museum holdings==\nYemenite silver is owned by the [[Israel Museum]], The Walters,  the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[British Museum]].<ref name=\"WaltersArtMuseum\"/><ref name=\"MetNecklace\"/><ref name=\"BritishMuseumNecklace\">{{cite web|title=necklace / qur'an-case / amulet|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1334044&partId=1&images=true|website=britishmuseum.org|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"CostumeAndJewelry\">{{cite web|title=Costume and Jewelry: A Matter of Identity|url=http://museum.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewGalleryE.asp?case=29|website=museum.imj.org.il|publisher=Israel Museum|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Museum exhibitions==\n* ''Diadem and Dagger: Jewish Silversmiths of Yemen'', [[Walters Art Museum]], 2002-03.<ref name=\"WaltersArtMuseum\">{{cite web|title=Diadem and Dagger: Jewish Silversmiths of Yemen|url=https://thewalters.org/news/releases/article.aspx?e_id=407|website=thewalters.org|publisher=Walters Art Museum|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"WeckerInTheYemen\">{{cite news|last1=Wecker|first1=Menachem|title=Silversmithing in the Yemen|url=http://forward.com/culture/167212/silversmithing-in-the-yemen/|accessdate=1 August 2017|publisher=TheForward|date=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n* ''\"Silver Speaks: Traditional Jewelry of the Middle East\"'', ''The Bead Museum'' in Washington, D.C., 2002\u201303; [[Arab American National Museum]], 2007\u201308.<ref name=\"RansomJewelry\">{{cite book|last1=Ransom|first1=Marjorie|title=Silver Treasures from the Land of Sheba; Regional Yemeni Jewelry|date=2014|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774166006|page=219}}</ref><ref name=\"AANM\">{{cite news|title=Silver Speaks: Traditional Jewelry of the Middle East|url=http://www.arabamericanmuseum.org/Silver-Speaks:-Traditional-Jewelry-of-the-Middle-East.id.311.htm|accessdate=1 August 2017|publisher=Arab American National Museum}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jewish ceremonial art]]\n* [[Gargush]]\n*[[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Intricate patterns.jpg|Silver earrings\nFile:Mannequin donned in women's finery.jpg|Mannequin with silver jewelry\nFile:Yemeni - Bracelet - Walters 572318 - Mark A.jpg|Yemenite Bracelet with signature of artisan\nFile:Sa - Bracelet - Walters 572322 - View B.jpg|Silver bracelet\nFile:Sa - Woman's Headband - Walters 572309 - Detail A.jpg|Woman's Headband\nFile:Jeruzalem.

After graduating first of his year from [[Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris]] in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in [[Athens]] between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the [[Roman Catholic]] church.\n\nHe wrote openly about his [[homoerotic]] experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]'' (''Particular Friendships''\u2014a term used in seminaries to refer to friendships seen as too close and exclusive, often incorrectly translated as \"Special Friendships\"), which won the coveted [[prix Renaudot]] in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name  which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old [[Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le]];<ref>R. Peyrefitte, ''Propos secrets'', 1977, pp. 285\u2013289; ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'', 1978, pp. 9 and 29.</ref> and both fell in love. Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in ''Notre amour'' (\"Our Love\" \u2013 1967) and ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'' (\"Child of the Heart\" \u2013 1978).  Malagnac later married [[performer]] [[Amanda Lear]].\n\nA cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Pope Pius&nbsp;XII]] in his book ''Les Cl\u00e9s de saint Pierre'' (1953), which earned him the nickname of \"Pope of the Homosexuals\". The publication of the book started a bitter quarrel with [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]]. Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', if it did not stop carrying advertisements for the book. The quarrel was exacerbated by Mauriac's articles attacking the memory of [[Jean Cocteau]] because of his homosexuality and the release of the film adaptation of ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res (film)|Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]''. This culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of being a hypocrite, a fake heterosexual who maligned his own children and a [[closeted]] homosexual with a past.<ref name=\"glbtq\">{{citation |last=Sibalis |first=Michael D. |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html |title=Peyrefitte, Roger |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215942/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 }}</ref><ref>[https://exilinterieur.blogspot.com/2009/05/lillustre-ecrivain-catholique.html ''L'illustre \u00e9crivain catholique]''</ref> It is said Mauriac was badly shaken with this letter, unable to get out of bed for a whole week.\n\nIn April 1976, after [[Pope]] [[Paul&nbsp;VI]] had condemned pre-marital sex, masturbation and [[homosexuality]] in the encyclical [https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19751229_persona-humana_en.html ''Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics''], in a series of interviews Peyrefitte accused him of being a [[closet homosexual]] that chose his papal name after his lover's first name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.traditioninaction.org/HotTopics/a02tPaulV_Accusations.html|title=Paul VI's Homosexuality: Rumor or Reality?|website=www.traditioninaction.org}}</ref> Although his statements were published in a few discrete magazines, Peyrefitte was surprised and overjoyed when one day he watched in television the Pope addressing the issue in the heart of [[St. Peter's Square]], complaining about the \"horrible and slanderous insinuations\" that were being said about the Holy Father and appealing for prayers on his behalf.\n\nIn ''Les Ambassades'' (1951), he revealed the ins and outs of diplomacy. Peyrefitte also wrote a book full of gossip about Baron [[Jacques d'Adelsw\u00e4rd-Fersen]]'s exile in [[Capri]] (''L'Exil\u00e9 de Capri'', 1959) and translated Greek gay love poetry (''La Muse gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re (The Boyish Muse)'', Flammarion, 1973).\n\nIn his memoirs, ''Propos Secrets'', he wrote extensively about his youth, his sex life ([[pederastic]] mainly and a few affairs with women), his years as a diplomat, his travels to Greece and Italy<ref>Making such polemic statements as that the majority of Italian men were [[bisexual]] and that [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]] was commonplace, much to the joy of Italian women and particularly as a [[birth control]] method.</ref> and his troubles with the police for sexually harassing male teenagers. He also gave vent to his fierce love of snobbish [[genealogy|genealogizing]] and vitriolic well-documented gossip, writing about famous people of his time such as [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Henry de Montherlant]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]], [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Marcel Jouhandeau]], [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], [[Gaston Gallimard]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Giscard d'Estaing]], [[Georges Pompidou]], among many others. Claiming he had reliable sources within the Vatican's \"black aristocracy\", once again he stated that three recent popes of the 20th century were homosexuals: [[Pius XII]], [[John XXIII]] and [[Paul VI]]. He particularly loved to expose the [[hypocrisy]] and [[vanity]] of prominent people, to denounce fake [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and to [[outing|out]] [[closeted homosexual]]s.\n\nRoger Peyrefitte wrote popular historical biographies about [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Voltaire]]. In ''Voltaire et Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric&nbsp;II'' he claimed that Voltaire had been the [[anal sex|passive]] lover of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nIn spite of his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views on sexuality, politically Peyrefitte was a [[conservatism|conservative]] [[bourgeois]] and in his later years he supported [[right-wing]]er [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215942/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html|url-status=dead|title=Article on Roger Peyrefitte at the ''GLBTQ Encyclopedia''|archivedate=September 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe died of [[Parkinson's disease]] at age 93 after receiving the [[last rites]] from the Catholic Church he had attacked so constantly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/08/arts/roger-peyrefitte-french-writer-dies-at-93.html |title=Roger Peyrefitte, French Writer, Dies at 93 |last=Riding |first=Alan |date=2000-11-08 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=50%|quote=I am the most well-known defender of homosexual rights in France.

After graduating first of his year from [[Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris]] in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in [[Athens]] between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the [[Roman Catholic]] church.\n\nHe wrote openly about his [[homoerotic]] experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]'' (''Particular Friendships''\u2014a term used in seminaries to refer to friendships seen as too close and exclusive, often incorrectly translated as \"Special Friendships\"), which won the coveted [[prix Renaudot]] in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name  which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old [[Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le]];<ref>R. Peyrefitte, ''Propos secrets'', 1977, pp. 285\u2013289; ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'', 1978, pp. 9 and 29.</ref> and both fell in love. Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in ''Notre amour'' (\"Our Love\" \u2013 1967) and ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'' (\"Child of the Heart\" \u2013 1978).  Malagnac later married [[performer]] [[Amanda Lear]].\n\nA cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Pope Pius&nbsp;XII]] in his book ''Les Cl\u00e9s de saint Pierre'' (1953), which earned him the nickname of \"Pope of the Homosexuals\". The publication of the book started a bitter quarrel with [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]]. Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', if it did not stop carrying advertisements for the book. The quarrel was exacerbated by Mauriac's articles attacking the memory of [[Jean Cocteau]] because of his homosexuality and the release of the film adaptation of ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res (film)|Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]''. This culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of being a hypocrite, a fake heterosexual who maligned his own children and a [[closeted]] homosexual with a past.<ref name=\"glbtq\">{{citation |last=Sibalis |first=Michael D. |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html |title=Peyrefitte, Roger |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215942/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 }}</ref><ref>[https://exilinterieur.blogspot.com/2009/05/lillustre-ecrivain-catholique.html ''L'illustre \u00e9crivain catholique]''</ref> It is said Mauriac was badly shaken with this letter, unable to get out of bed for a whole week.\n\nIn April 1976, after [[Pope]] [[Paul&nbsp;VI]] had condemned pre-marital sex, masturbation and [[homosexuality]] in the encyclical [https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19751229_persona-humana_en.html ''Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics''], in a series of interviews Peyrefitte accused him of being a [[closet homosexual]] that chose his papal name after his lover's first name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.traditioninaction.org/HotTopics/a02tPaulV_Accusations.html|title=Paul VI's Homosexuality: Rumor or Reality?|website=www.traditioninaction.org}}</ref> Although his statements were published in a few discrete magazines, Peyrefitte was surprised and overjoyed when one day he watched in television the Pope addressing the issue in the heart of [[St. Peter's Square]], complaining about the \"horrible and slanderous insinuations\" that were being said about the Holy Father and appealing for prayers on his behalf.\n\nIn ''Les Ambassades'' (1951), he revealed the ins and outs of diplomacy. Peyrefitte also wrote a book full of gossip about Baron [[Jacques d'Adelsw\u00e4rd-Fersen]]'s exile in [[Capri]] (''L'Exil\u00e9 de Capri'', 1959) and translated Greek gay love poetry (''La Muse gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re (The Boyish Muse)'', Flammarion, 1973).\n\nIn his memoirs, ''Propos Secrets'', he wrote extensively about his youth, his sex life ([[pederastic]] mainly and a few affairs with women), his years as a diplomat, his travels to Greece and Italy<ref>Making such polemic statements as that the majority of Italian men were [[bisexual]] and that [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]] was commonplace, much to the joy of Italian women and particularly as a [[birth control]] method.</ref> and his troubles with the police for sexually harassing male teenagers. He also gave vent to his fierce love of snobbish [[genealogy|genealogizing]] and vitriolic well-documented gossip, writing about famous people of his time such as [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Henry de Montherlant]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]], [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Marcel Jouhandeau]], [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], [[Gaston Gallimard]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Giscard d'Estaing]], [[Georges Pompidou]], among many others. Claiming he had reliable sources within the Vatican's \"black aristocracy\", once again he stated that three recent popes of the 20th century were homosexuals: [[Pius XII]], [[John XXIII]] and [[Paul VI]]. He particularly loved to expose the [[hypocrisy]] and [[vanity]] of prominent people, to denounce fake [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and to [[outing|out]] [[closeted homosexual]]s.\n\nRoger Peyrefitte wrote popular historical biographies about [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Voltaire]]. In ''Voltaire et Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric&nbsp;II'' he claimed that Voltaire had been the [[anal sex|passive]] lover of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nIn spite of his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views on sexuality, politically Peyrefitte was a [[conservatism|conservative]] [[bourgeois]] and in his later years he supported [[right-wing]]er [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215942/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html|url-status=dead|title=Article on Roger Peyrefitte at the ''GLBTQ Encyclopedia''|archivedate=September 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe died of [[Parkinson's disease]] at age 93 after receiving the [[last rites]] from the Catholic Church he had attacked so constantly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/08/arts/roger-peyrefitte-french-writer-dies-at-93.html |title=Roger Peyrefitte, French Writer, Dies at 93 |last=Riding |first=Alan |date=2000-11-08 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=50%|quote=I am the most well-known defender of homosexual rights in France.

The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Senators]] team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.\n\n====Team nickname====\nThe Washington franchise was known as both \"Senators\" and \"Nationals\" at various times, and sometimes at the same time.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the \"Washington Nationals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/ |title=Minnesota Twins Team History & Encyclopedia | work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}</ref> The name \"Nationals\" appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats.\" Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the \"Senators\" nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American League team using the \"Nationals\" name. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.\n\nThe team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of [[Clark Griffith]]'s death. It was not until 1959 that the word \"Senators\" first appeared on team shirts. \"Nats,\" from the team name's middle syllable, continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|1961 expansion team]], which was never officially known as \"Nationals.\"\n\nThe current \"Nationals\" and \"Nats\" names were revived in 2005, when the [[Montreal Expos]] relocated to Washington to become the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]].\n\n===Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present===\nIn 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner [[Calvin Griffith]], Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] his team to [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league approval, the team moved to [[Minnesota]] after the 1960 season, setting up shop in [[Metropolitan Stadium]], while Washington fielded a brand new \"Washington Senators\" (which later became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] prior to the 1972 season).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/rang.shtml |title=Texas Rangers on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSuccess came quickly to the team in Minnesota.

Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as [[New Jersey]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area]], and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|elimination]] due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.\n\n===Target Field===\n{{Main|Target Field}}\n[[Image:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Target Field]] in 2010.]]\nIn response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium\u2014 a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]\u2014 owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003105952/http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061p1.aspx |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come.

There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.\n\nPrior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile were marked on the \"Baggie\" in right field.\n\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=HarmonKillebrewTwins.png|name=[[Harmon Killebrew|Harmon<br />Killebrew]]|pos=LF-1B-3B|date=<br />May 4, 1975}}\n{{retired number|image=TonyOilvaTwins.png|name=[[Tony Oliva|Tony<br />Oliva]]|pos=RF-DH-Coach|date=July 14, 1991}}\n{{retired number|image=JoeMauerTwins.png|name=[[Joe Mauer|Joe<br />Mauer]]|pos=C-1B|date=June 15, 2019}}\n{{retired number|image=TomKellyTwins.png|name=[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom<br />Kelly]]|pos=Manager|date=September 8, 2012}}\n{{retired number|image=KentHrbekTwins.png|name=[[Kent Hrbek|Kent<br />Hrbek]]|pos=1B|date=August 13, 1995}}\n{{retired number|image=BertBlylevenTwins.png|name=[[Bert Blyleven|Bert<br />Blyleven]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2011}}\n{{retired number|image=RodCarewTwins.png|name=[[Rod Carew|Rod<br />Carew]]|pos=1B-2B|date=July 19, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=KirbyPuckett_Twins.png||name=[[Kirby Puckett|Kirby<br />Puckett]]|pos=CF|date=May 25, 1997}}\n{{retired number|image=Minnesota_Twins_42.png|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]|pos=All MLB|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\n[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs in 2010.]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.\n\nThe numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXxe3Gi8Ca4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=minnesota+jackie+robinson+%22May+23+1997%22&source=bl&ots=8DH_7ly1u2&sig=BT_fjk1Y8B-_Waus6CLJ6sGMxBw&hl=en&ei=r9alTviRBsmftwftoeSwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Minnesota Sports Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Player!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Jersey!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Position!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Date retired\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Harmon Killebrew]] || 3 || LF-1B-3B: 1954\u201360 (WAS)<br />LF-1B-3B: 1961\u201374 (MIN) || May 4, 1975\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Rod Carew]] || 29 || 1B-2B: 1967\u201378 (MIN) || July 19, 1987\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tony Oliva]] || 6 || RF-DH: 1962\u201376 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1976\u201378 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1985\u201391 (MIN) || July 14, 1991\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kent Hrbek]] || 14 || 1B: 1981\u201394 (MIN) || August 13, 1995\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Jackie Robinson]] || 42 || Retired by MLB || April 15, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kirby Puckett]] || 34 || CF: 1984\u201395 (MIN) || May 25, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Bert Blyleven]] || 28 || P: 1970\u201376 (MIN)<br />P: 1985\u201388 (MIN) || July 16, 2011\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] || 10 || Manager: 1986\u20132001 (MIN) || September 8, 2012\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Joe Mauer]] || 7 || C-1B-DH: 2004-2018 (MIN) || June 15, 2019\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title=Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League by Baseball Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/retired_numbers.jsp|title=Retired Numbers|work=Minnesota Twins|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins award winners and league leaders}}\n\n==Team records==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins team records}}\n\n==Team seasons==\n{{main|List of Minnesota Twins seasons}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Senators]] team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.\n\n====Team nickname====\nThe Washington franchise was known as both \"Senators\" and \"Nationals\" at various times, and sometimes at the same time.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the \"Washington Nationals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/ |title=Minnesota Twins Team History & Encyclopedia | work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}</ref> The name \"Nationals\" appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats.\" Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the \"Senators\" nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American League team using the \"Nationals\" name. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.\n\nThe team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of [[Clark Griffith]]'s death. It was not until 1959 that the word \"Senators\" first appeared on team shirts. \"Nats,\" from the team name's middle syllable, continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|1961 expansion team]], which was never officially known as \"Nationals.\"\n\nThe current \"Nationals\" and \"Nats\" names were revived in 2005, when the [[Montreal Expos]] relocated to Washington to become the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]].\n\n===Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present===\nIn 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner [[Calvin Griffith]], Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] his team to [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league approval, the team moved to [[Minnesota]] after the 1960 season, setting up shop in [[Metropolitan Stadium]], while Washington fielded a brand new \"Washington Senators\" (which later became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] prior to the 1972 season).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/rang.shtml |title=Texas Rangers on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSuccess came quickly to the team in Minnesota.

The \"TC\" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms.

Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as [[New Jersey]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area]], and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|elimination]] due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.\n\n===Target Field===\n{{Main|Target Field}}\n[[Image:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Target Field]] in 2010.]]\nIn response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium\u2014 a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]\u2014 owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003105952/http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061p1.aspx |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come.

The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIN/MIN201004120.shtml |title=April 12, 2010 Boston Red Sox at Minnesota Twins Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, Target Field was named \"The Best Place To Shop\" by [[Street and Smith]]'s ''SportsBusiness Journal'' at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/sports-business/2011/05/target-field-named-sports-facility-of.html |title=Target Field named Sports Facility of the Year |first=John |last=Vomhof, Jr. |publisher=Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> It was also named \"The Best Sports Stadium in North America\" by ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hart Van Denburg |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |title=ESPN Magazine calls Target Field the best stadium in North America |newspaper=City Pages |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517133915/http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2014, Target Field hosted the [[2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] and the [[2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|Home Run Derby]].\n\n==Roster==\n{{Minnesota Twins roster}}\n\n[[Minnesota Twins all-time roster]]: A complete list of players who played in at least one game for the Twins franchise.\n\n==Minor league affiliates==\n{{Main|List of Minnesota Twins minor league affiliates}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Level\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Team\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|League\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Location\n|-\n| ''AAA''\n| [[Rochester Red Wings]]\n| [[International League]]\n| [[Rochester, New York]]\n|-\n| ''AA''\n| [[Pensacola Blue Wahoos]]\n| [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]\n| [[Pensacola, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''Advanced A''\n| [[Fort Myers Mighty Mussels]]\n| [[Florida State League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''A''\n| [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]]\n| [[Midwest League]]\n| [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|''Rookie''\n| [[Elizabethton Twins]]\n| [[Appalachian League]]\n| [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]]\n|-\n| [[Gulf Coast League Twins|GCL Twins]]\n| [[Gulf Coast League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| Dominican Summer Twins|DSL Twins\n| [[Dominican Summer League]]\n| [[Dominican Republic]]\n|}\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Minnesota Twins\n| All Team Names = Twins or Senators\n| ColorA# = 002B5C\n| ColorB# = FFFFFF\n| ColorC# = D31145\n| ColorD# = FFFFFF\n| Team Name 1 = '''Washington Senators'''\n| List 1.1 = [[Stan Coveleski]]<br />[[Joe Cronin]]<br />[[Ed Delahanty]]\n| List 1.2 = [[Rick Ferrell]]<br />[[Lefty Gomez]]<br />'''[[Goose Goslin]]''' *\n| List 1.3 = [[Clark Griffith]] *<br />'''[[Bucky Harris]]''' *<br />[[Whitey Herzog]]<br />'''[[Walter Johnson]]''' *\n| List 1.4 = [[Heinie Manush]] *<br />'''[[Sam Rice]]''' *<br />[[Al Simmons]]\n| List 1.5 =[[George Sisler]]<br />[[Tris Speaker]]<br />[[Early Wynn]]\n| Team Name 2 = '''Minnesota Twins'''\n| List 2.1 = '''[[Bert Blyleven]]''' *\n| List 2.2 = '''[[Rod Carew]]''' *<br />[[Steve Carlton]]\n| List 2.3 = '''[[Harmon Killebrew]]''' *<br />[[Paul Molitor]]\n| List 2.4 = [[Jack Morris]]<br />'''[[Kirby Puckett]]''' *\n| List 2.5 = [[Jim Thome]]<br />[[Dave Winfield]]\n\n| Team Name 3 =\n| List 3.1 =\n| List 3.2 =\n| List 3.3 =\n| List 3.4 =\n| List 3.5 =\n| Team Name 4 =\n| List 4.1 =\n| List 4.2 =\n| List 4.3 =\n| List 4.4 =\n| List 4.5 =\n| Footnote1 = * Washington Senators or Minnesota Twins listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n| Footnote2 =\n| Footnote3 =\n| Footnote4 =\n|}}\nMolitor, Morris, and Winfield were all [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] natives who joined the Twins late in their careers and were warmly received as \"hometown heroes\", but were elected to the Hall primarily on the basis of their tenures with other teams.

Metrodome}}\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nThe Metrodome's upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.\n\nPrior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile were marked on the \"Baggie\" in right field.\n\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=HarmonKillebrewTwins.png|name=[[Harmon Killebrew|Harmon<br />Killebrew]]|pos=LF-1B-3B|date=<br />May 4, 1975}}\n{{retired number|image=TonyOilvaTwins.png|name=[[Tony Oliva|Tony<br />Oliva]]|pos=RF-DH-Coach|date=July 14, 1991}}\n{{retired number|image=JoeMauerTwins.png|name=[[Joe Mauer|Joe<br />Mauer]]|pos=C-1B|date=June 15, 2019}}\n{{retired number|image=TomKellyTwins.png|name=[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom<br />Kelly]]|pos=Manager|date=September 8, 2012}}\n{{retired number|image=KentHrbekTwins.png|name=[[Kent Hrbek|Kent<br />Hrbek]]|pos=1B|date=August 13, 1995}}\n{{retired number|image=BertBlylevenTwins.png|name=[[Bert Blyleven|Bert<br />Blyleven]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2011}}\n{{retired number|image=RodCarewTwins.png|name=[[Rod Carew|Rod<br />Carew]]|pos=1B-2B|date=July 19, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=KirbyPuckett_Twins.png||name=[[Kirby Puckett|Kirby<br />Puckett]]|pos=CF|date=May 25, 1997}}\n{{retired number|image=Minnesota_Twins_42.png|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]|pos=All MLB|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\n[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs in 2010.]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.\n\nThe numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXxe3Gi8Ca4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=minnesota+jackie+robinson+%22May+23+1997%22&source=bl&ots=8DH_7ly1u2&sig=BT_fjk1Y8B-_Waus6CLJ6sGMxBw&hl=en&ei=r9alTviRBsmftwftoeSwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Minnesota Sports Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Player!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Jersey!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Position!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Date retired\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Harmon Killebrew]] || 3 || LF-1B-3B: 1954\u201360 (WAS)<br />LF-1B-3B: 1961\u201374 (MIN) || May 4, 1975\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Rod Carew]] || 29 || 1B-2B: 1967\u201378 (MIN) || July 19, 1987\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tony Oliva]] || 6 || RF-DH: 1962\u201376 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1976\u201378 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1985\u201391 (MIN) || July 14, 1991\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kent Hrbek]] || 14 || 1B: 1981\u201394 (MIN) || August 13, 1995\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Jackie Robinson]] || 42 || Retired by MLB || April 15, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kirby Puckett]] || 34 || CF: 1984\u201395 (MIN) || May 25, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Bert Blyleven]] || 28 || P: 1970\u201376 (MIN)<br />P: 1985\u201388 (MIN) || July 16, 2011\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] || 10 || Manager: 1986\u20132001 (MIN) || September 8, 2012\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Joe Mauer]] || 7 || C-1B-DH: 2004-2018 (MIN) || June 15, 2019\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title=Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League by Baseball Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/retired_numbers.jsp|title=Retired Numbers|work=Minnesota Twins|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins award winners and league leaders}}\n\n==Team records==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins team records}}\n\n==Team seasons==\n{{main|List of Minnesota Twins seasons}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Most of the Welsh examples are in the southern coastal border area of Wales and particularly in Pembrokeshire.<ref>\"Hilling\", 96\u201397, fig 61 and appendix K</ref> So far no Welsh [[timber-framed]] houses can be securely dated to before 1400, but the description by the poet [[Iolo Goch]] of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]\u2019s house at [[Sycharth]] shows that houses with timber [[cruck]] framing were being built well before this date. It has been suggested that the devastation caused following Owain Glynd\u0175r's revolt may have caused the destruction of many earlier timber-framed houses in the [[Welsh Marches]]<ref>\"Suggett & Stevenson\", (2010), 34</ref>\n\n===Tower houses and first floor halls===\n''see also'': [[Welsh Tower houses]]\n[[File:The Old Rectory, Angle.jpeg|thumb|The Old Rectory, Angle]]\n[[File:Tower , near Mold 1846.jpeg|thumb|left|Tower, near Mold 1846]]\nThe distribution of tower houses in Wales has been discussed by both Hilling and Smith. Welsh tower houses, most of them built between the early 14th and 15th centuries, were rectangular structures, consisting of two or more storeys, and are closely related to those in Ireland and Scotland.  In 1976 Hilling produced a map (with listing) showing 17 examples.<ref>Hilling J ''Historic Architecture of Wales: An Introduction.'' (1976), Univ. Wales Press, Cardiff, pp. 95\u20136</ref> Further houses have been added by Suggett and it is possible that new examples will be recognised as being incorporated into existing buildings, as at Sandyhaven House in Pembrokeshire.<ref>\"Suggett\", 2010, p. 29</ref>\n\nA further example is likely to be the prominent East Gate tower of [[Powis Castle]]. The East Gate appears to have been a tower house, which had an entrance made through the vaulted undercroft, probably in the 17th century. An extra storey was added to the tower in 1815\u20131818 when [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]] re-fenestrated the castle and added [[Gothic Revival]] battlements.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", (2013), 244</ref> Also on the Welsh border, close to [[Welshpool]] is [[Wattlesborough Castle|Wattlesburgh]].  Many of the English tower houses, such as [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall]] Castle or [[Buckden Towers|Buckden Palace]] are slightly later and larger than the Welsh examples, and built of brick.\n\nApart from tower houses there are a number of stone-built first floor hall buildings, where the hall is mounted over an [[undercroft]]. These include [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s Parliament House in Machynlleth. Most examples are found in southern Wales with a cluster of buildings in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The distribution of Tower and other houses in Wales with vaulted ceilings have been mapped and listed by Peter Smith.<ref>\"Smith P.(1988), 372\u20135, Map 7</ref>\n\nThey also occur as early merchant's houses in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] and [[Tenby]]. In some cases the hall is accessed by an outer stair, as is the case at Pentre Ifan Barn at [[Nevern]] in Pembrokeshire.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2013) 311</ref> Another example is Eastington at [[Rhoscrowther]], Pembrokeshire,  which has been called a tower house, but is more correctly a first floor hall house, with an outside stair and [[crenulation]]s with a side tower.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2013) 374, fig.</ref> Eastington belonged to the [[John Perrot|Perrot family]] in the 15th century. There is a further complex of [[Medieval]] stone houses at East Orchard, [[St Athan]], in Glamorgan which belonged to the [[Coity Castle|de Berkerolles]] family in the 14th century.  The group of buildings includes a first floor hall house with outside chimney, which also had a separate kitchen block.<ref>\"Newman\" (1995), 548, with reconstruction drawing go the buildings</ref>\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px>\nWattlesborough Tower, Shropshire.png|Wattlesborough Tower, Shropshire\nDavid Cox (II) - Powys Castle, Wales.jpg|David Cox (II).

Some of these such as [[Chirk Castle]] and [[Powis Castle]] have remained as houses, but others such as [[Raglan Castle]] in Monmouthshire and [[Carew Castle]] in Pembrokeshire are ruins which can provide some idea of their grandeur. At Carew [[Sir Rhys ap Thomas]] from about 1480 onwards undertook a grand re-modelling including an almost entire [[Fenestration (architecture)|re-fenestration]] with straight headed windows. This was continued after 1558 by [[Sir John Perrot]], who replaced the north range with a splendid frontage with a long gallery at the second floor level in the fashion of [[Robert Smythson]].<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2004), 152\u20134.</ref>\n\nAn even more impressive residence on palatial scale was [[Raglan Castle]]. The earliest building is the freestanding hexagonal great tower, which is surrounded by a moat. It was probably built by [[William ap Thomas|Sir William ap Thomas]] before 1445. It would have served the function of a strongly defended tower house. This was followed in 1461\u20131469 by the enlargement of the castle by Sir William Herbert with a gatehouse to the NE and to the SW a range of sumptuously decorated state apartments. Further apartment ranges were built round the SW court. The two sets of apartments were approached by an impressive main staircase. From about 1549 to 1559 these buildings were extended, by [[William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester]],  particularly around the ''Pitched Stone'' Court and also with the long-gallery with its elaborately decorated [[Renaissance]] fireplaces. The slighting of the castle in the [[English Civil War]] and its subsequent partial demolition make it hard to appreciate Raglan as one of the major domestic buildings of Wales.<ref>\"Newman\"(2000) 489\u2013509.</ref> \n[[File:Tretower Court - geograph.org.uk - 562361.jpg|thumb|Tretower Court]]\n[[File:Tretower Court - geograph.org.uk - 550255.jpg|thumb|left|Tretower Court]]\nAnother early house connected with the Herbert family was [[Tretower Court]] in [[Breconshire]]. It was here that [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1469)|William Herbert]] settled his step brother Roger Vaughan who built a house, which was to develop round a courtyard and continued being added to until the 17th century. Recently the arched braced truss roof of the great hall has been dated by [[Dendrochronology]] to c. 1455.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\" (2013), 582\u2013589</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Houses associated with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].===\n[[File:Parliament House, Machynlleth.jpeg|thumb|left|Parliament House, Machynlleth in 1816]]\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr's parliament - geograph.org.uk - 379309.jpg|thumb|Owain Glynd\u0175r's parliament house]]\nThere are a number of houses in north Wales that have been traditionally associated with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] and there is also the Parliament House of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] at Ruthin. They may not be certainly associated with these historic figures, but they are important as evidence for early stone buildings in Wales. Best known is [[Owain Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House, Machynlleth|Glynd\u0175r's Parliament house in Machynlleth]]. This building has been substantially altered in more recent times, but fortunately Edward Pugh published a fine coloured lithograph of the building in 1816.<ref>Edward Pugh (1816), ''Cambria Depicta'', pg. 222</ref>  Recent dendrochronological dating of the felling of a roof timber to 1470, does not necessarily mean that the stone structure of the building in not associated with Glynd\u0175r.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1909 |title =Full Record - Machynlleth, The Parliament House|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref> The original building is a hall house with a four-unit plan: storeyed outer room of two bays, open passage (2 bays between partition trusses), open hall (three bays with dais-end partition),  and a storeyed inner-room of two bays. The carpentry is refined: [[purlins]] and ridge are tenoned into the [[trusses]]. The principal rafters of each truss are unusually shaped ('extruded') to receive the [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned collar]]. In the hall the purlins are moulded with two tiers of [[wind brace]]s (replaced), and the trusses have shaped feet. The upper-end truss is set forward from the [[dais]] partition to form a shallow canopy.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\". (2013), pg195</ref>\n[[File:Owen Glyndwr's Prison.png|thumb|Owen Glynd\u0175r's Prison, Carrog in 1794.]]\nAt [[Carrog]] near [[Corwen]] parts of Owain's ''Prison'' stood, possibly into the 20th century.  Thomas Pennant wrote in about 1776 that \"The prison where Owen confined his captives was not far from his house, in the parish of Llansantfraid Glyndwrdwy and the place is to this day called 'Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy'. Some remains are still to be seen near the church, which form part of a habitable house. It consists of a room 13 feet square and ten and a half high. The sides consist of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches asunder, mortised into them. In these are groves in the bottom, as if there had been cross bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly strong, composed of strong planks almost contiguous. It seems as if there had been two stories; but the upper part at present is evidently modern\".<ref>Pennant T, (1784) ''Tour in Wales''. Bridge Books reprint, Wrexham, 1990, Vol 1, 387\u20138</ref>  In 1794 John Ingleby was employed to make a watercolour record of the building, which stood just to the SE of the church and overlooked the River Dee. The building which was thatched and has some timber [[Close Studding|close studding]] and also a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arched window and Gothic arched doors.  There seems to be evidence for an outer stair leading to a first floor hall, which suggests that parts of the building could well have been contemporary with Owain Glynd\u0175r.

The [[Medieval Welsh literature|Welsh Poets]] often provide good descriptions of these early houses from the 14th century onwards, when praising their patrons.  This is the case of [[Iolo Goch]]'s description of [[Owain Glyndwr]]'s house at [[Sycharth]] in the late 14th century, when the poet mentioned that the house was constructed with [[cruck]]s and had a slate roof.<ref>Johnston Dafydd, (1993), ''Iolo Goch: The Poems'', Gomer Welsh Classics Series, Llandysul,</ref>\nThe earliest timber framed houses are hall houses, which were single storied houses the main room of which was heated by a fire on an open hearth with the smoke escaping through a vent in the roof. In peasant houses the hall would have only consisted of a single bay. These smaller houses are rarely recognised now and where they exist the single bay is likely to form part of the structure of a larger house with more recent additions.\n\n===Dendrochronology and the dating of Welsh houses===\nSince the 1990s the availability of dates provided by tree-ring dating or [[dendrochronology]] has revolutionised the study of early buildings in Wales and is particularly relevant for timber framed buildings. The earliest tree ring date associated with a building in Wales is a date commissioned by [[CADW]] for a door at [[Chepstow Castle]] which was made from wood felled between 1159 and 1189.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1052 |title =Full Record - Chepstow, Chepstow Castle|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref>\n[[File:Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire 34.JPG|thumb|left|Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire, the door dated to 1159-1189AD]] A complete listing of tree ring dates for Wales is maintained by the Vernacular Architecture Group<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vag.org.uk/index.htm|title = Vernacular Architecture Group}}</ref> at the Archaeological Dataservice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/|title=Dendrochronology Database|author=|date= |work= archaeologydataservice.ac.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>  and slightly over 200 samples have been taken, though not all have provided positive results. The scheme has largely been sponsored by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] in conjunction with the Dating Welsh Houses Group (DOWG).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.datingoldwelshhouses.co.uk |title=Home|author=|date=|work=datingoldwelshhouses.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> The greatest number of dates are available from [[Merionethshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]] and [[Denbighshire]], areas which have some of the greatest concentrations of timber framed houses. Other early dates are c. 1250 for timbers from the Chapter House at [[Brecon Cathedral]] and 1386 for the bell frame in Tower of [[St David's Cathedral]]. The earliest domestic building to be dated by dendrochronology is Hafodygarreg at [[Erwood]], in [[Breconshire]] of 1402.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1901|title =  Full Record - Crucadarn, Erwood, Hafodygarreg|website=Dendrochronology Database|publisher= Archaeology Data Service }}</ref> Many dates have been obtained for buildings after this, possibly suggesting that there was a great re-building in Wales after the devastation caused by [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s uprising. The evidence of dendrochronology clearly shows that in the 15th. and first half of the 16th. centuries [[Hall house]]s were the standard plan for domestic buildings. The great majority of [[timber-framed]] houses were built with [[cruck]] trusses, while a few higher status houses were constructed with aisled-trusses. Change came in the mid-16th century when houses became two or more storeyed. Regional forms of house evolve and some are now stone built. The earliest stone built ''Snowdonia Houses'', with an upper storey, is Tyn Llan at [[Gwyddelwern]], which has been shown by dendrochronology to date from 1519 to 1537.<ref>\"Suggett R & Dunn M\", (2015), 22</ref> The timber framed [[Glas Hirfryn]], on the Montgomeryshire/Denbighshire border, a house with a jettied upper storey and lateral chimney stack, is dated to c.1559. The precision of dendrochronological dating is very useful as it is often possible to suggest, with a considerable degree of certainty, for whom the house was built.  At Glas Hirfryn this would have been Morus ap Dafydd and at [[Great Cefnyberen]], built between 1545 and 1566, it would have been John ap Rhys. As the [[Will and testament|wills]] and [[Probate|probate inventories]] may well still exist, it is often possible to establish the status of the builder and how the house was furnished.\n\n==Aisled hall houses==\n[[File:Plas Uchaf, Corwen.png|thumb|left|Plas Uchaf, Corwen. Aisled hall]]\n\nAisled-framed [[hall house]]s have one or more rows of interior posts. These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. Aisled\nHall houses are early in the sequence of timber framed houses and were high status dwellings . In his study of these houses Peter Smith recorded 20 examples of this construction, mainly in NE Wales and particularly in [[Denbighshire]].<ref>Smith P (2001) \"Ty Mawr and the Aisle-Truss Houses of Wales'' in \"Britnell W\" (Ed), 201-18</ref> In some cases such as [[Plas Uchaf]] at [[Llangar]], which has now been restored by the [[Landmark Trust]] the roof was supported by both [[aisle]] and [[cruck]] trusses. Plas Cadogan at [[Esclusham]] near Wrexham survived as the finest example of a Welsh aisled house with an open hall up to roof. Despite being a Grade I listed building it was demolished in 1967.<ref>\"Hubbard\",(1985), pg. 165</ref> The roof has now been re-erected at the [[Avoncroft Museum]] at Bromsgrove.\n[[File:Althrey Hall, Bangor on Dee 1794.png|thumb|Althrey Hall, Bangor on Dee. Watercolour by John Ingleby 1794]] Aisled hall houses in Wales have been dated by dendrochronology to the 15th century, though examples in England are often earlier. Some of the aisled houses such as the Upper House at [[Painscastle]] in Radnorshire or Althrey Hall in [[Maelor Saesneg]] had box-framed wings added to provide far greater accommodation and formed an '''H''' shaped plan for the building. Althrey Hall was built in the early C16 and was described by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] as ''a fair house'' in the 1530s. It is thought that it was built for Richard ap Howel. The double portrait wallpainting surviving in the first floor of mid-16th-century date is likely to represent Richard's son, Elis ap Richard (died 1558), with his bride Jane Hanmer.<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1986), 321.</ref>\n[[File:T\u0177 Mawr, Castle Caereinion - geograph.org.uk - 1571886.jpg|thumb|left|T\u0177 Mawr, Castle Caereinion]]  An example of an aisled hall house that has been studied in great detail and fully restored is [[Ty Mawr, Castle Caereinion]] in Montgomeryshire. This house has been dated to 1460 by dendrochronology and was owned by the Alo ap Rhiwallon family (who had settled there in the 13th century), and the builder of T\u0177 Mawr was probably Dafydd ap Gwilym, the great-great-grandson of Alo ap Rhiwallon.<ref>Chapman M Ll ''Ty Mawr, Castle Caereinion: a history of ownership and tenancy'', in \"Britnell\", 179-98</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cruck construction==\n[[File:Arch Camb Vol 2 1872 21 21.jpeg|thumb|left|Abbott's Barn at Wigmore on the Welsh borders]]\n[[File:Cruck Barn at Ty-coch 03.jpg|thumb|Cruck Barn at Ty-coch File:Cruck Barn at Ty-coch 03.jpg|Cruck Barn at Ty-coch Llangynhafal, Denbighshire.

Some of the cruck framed houses were extended by adding wings, providing an '''H''' shaped layout. With the introduction of [[Timber framing|box framed]] and [[jettied]] houses in the mid-15th century, the use of crucks gradually went out of fashion. At this time many cruck houses were converted into barns and evidence for fireplaces and chimney stacks stripped. A good example of a house that has been converted into a barn, possibly as late as the 18th century is at [[Ty Coch Cruck Barn, Llangynhafal, Denbighshire|Ty-coch]] [[Llangynhafal]], Denbighshire. This has recently been restored by Denbighshire County Council and it has been dated to 1430.<ref>Miles, D, Worthington, M & Bridge, M , 2006 , List 181: Welsh Dendrochronology Project \u2013 Phase 10, ''Vernacular Architecture'' Vol. 37.</ref> There are many instances in [[Montgomeryshire]] where more elaborate timber framed farmhouses are associated on the same site with earlier houses which were converted into barns.

''Medieval Houses''. Part II. ''Sub Medieval Houses'', c. 1550\u20131610. Part III. ''Renaissance Houses''. c. 1590\u20131714 , National Museum of Wales.</ref> Fox and Raglan recognised that around 1550 a great change occurred in Welsh House building. While the earlier Medieval traditions of constructing with [[cruck]]s and [[timber framing]] continued, many new features start to appear in domestic architecture. Chimneys start to be inserted into the halls of houses instead of the open fireplaces and chimney stacks may either be built on the gable ends of houses or as ''lateral chimneys'' on the side walls. At the same time timber framed and stone houses start to be built with one and even more [[storeys]]. [[Timber framing|Box framing]] starts to supplant the older timber framing with crucks and in order to gain more floor space at the upper levels these floors were [[jettied]] out from the building line. Fox and Raglan considered that in Monmouthshire, the building of ''Sub-Medieval''  houses continued until around 1620.<ref>Fox and Raglan's dating of these houses needs to be refined in the light of more recent [[dendrochronological]] dating</ref> In the later part of the 16th century, sub-medieval houses continued to be built in parallel with often grander houses showing [[Renaissance]] style or influences.\n[[File:Llancaiach Fawr.jpg|thumb|Llancaiach Fawr]]\nAn excellent example of a ''Sub Medieval'' house is [[Llancaiach Fawr|Llancaeach-Fawr]] at [[Gelligaer]] in Glamorgan. [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]] comments that in contrast with other buildings of the period ''it is a delight to find one so nearly perfectly preserved''. It is of three storeys and largely of a single build period. It was built by either Richard ap Lewis or his son David ap Richard (Prichard), who was resident here in the 1530s. The windows emphasise the importance of the first floor rooms.<ref>\"Newman\"(1995), 353\u2013356, with plans</ref>\n\nThe ideas of Fox and Raglan were developed by [[Peter Smith (architectural historian)|Peter Smith]] in his study of ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', first published in 1975 and re-issued as an enlarged addition in 1988. Smith classifies five main types of ''Sub-Medieval'' house based on the position of the chimney or chimneys and the position of the main entrance door.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 157\u2013221</ref> These groups are:\n* Type A, Houses with Lateral Chimney heating the hall of the house or end gable houses. These occur in northern and southern areas of Wales but rarely in the central areas.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 28</ref> The end gable houses include the ''Snowdonia'' houses of north Wales\n* Type B. Houses with the chimney backing on the entry. The chimneys are placed centrally in the house and the entrance may lead into a screens passage at the back of the fireplace.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 29 a&b</ref>\n* Type C. The ''Lobby Entrance House'' where the fireplace is centrally placed and the entrance is by a door into a small lobby area placed against the chimney stack. Those houses are timber framed and occur mainly in Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Denbighshire. The ''Severn Valley'' houses of Montgomeryshire are within this grouping.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 30</ref>\n* Type D. Similar to the ''Lobby Entry Houses'' but lack the double-backed fireplaces and have an additional end gable. There are a few houses of this type in N.E. Wales, but otherwise they occur as stone built houses in Glamorgan.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 30, pg. 163</ref> \n* Type H. This is a gable entry house, similar to type B, but the entry is away from the gable fireplace. This type only occurs in [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire]].<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 163\u20134</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Long houses and the long house controversy===\n{{See also|Dartmoor longhouse}}\n[[File:Cilewent farmhouse, St Fagans.jpg|thumb|left|Cilewent farmhouse, St Fagans]]\n[[File:Hendre'r Ywydd Uchaf farmhouse, St Fagans.jpg|thumb|Hendre'r Ywydd Uchaf farmhouse, St Fagans]]\nA good example of a long house is Cilewent Farmhouse from Llansanffraid Cwmteuddwr, nr [[Rhayader]], [[Radnorshire]] which has been reconstructed at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]]. This is a ''long-house'', with cattle being accommodated at one end and humans at the other, with a passageway between the two parts. This type of farmhouse was once common in mid- and south Wales. This cruck and timber-framed house was originally built about 1470 as an open [[hall house]]. The original timber walls were rebuilt in stone in 1734, with the date being carved on the head of the entrance door frame. All that remains of the original house are the two cruck trusses in the cow house and the timber-framed partition between the cow house and the dwelling.  Another re-construction at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]] is Hendre'r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse from [[Llangynhafal]] in Denbighshire. This a cruck-framed hall-house [[Dendrochronology |dendrochronologically]] dated to 1508 and typical of the better class of Welsh farmhouse in the late Middle Ages. The building is divided into five bays, the lower two used for housing for cattle and horses, the centre bay serving as a work-room and the upper two comprising the open hall and a bedroom. The outside walls are timber-framed, the panels being in-filled with wattle and daubed with clay. Both the daubed panels and the timber work are limewashed as was common in the Middle Ages. The open hearth is placed in the centre of the hall, smoke from the fire escaping through the roof and the unglazed windows.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 47\u201349</ref>  Excavations in 2003 by Bill Britnell at T\u0177 Draw at [[Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr]] in north Powys have done much to elucidate the relationship of the cow house with the hall of a longhouse.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britnell |first1=W.

These would have provided stalls for cattle which were overwintered from November to March each year. Similar evidence for stalls for cattle have been found at [[Ty Mawr, Castle Caereinion|T\u0177 Mawr]] and Tyddyn Llwydion in [[Montgomeryshire]].<ref>\"Britnell W. J. et al.\", (2008), 171\u20133</ref>\n\nThe idea of the \"Longhouse'' or ''T\u0177-hir'' was first discussed by [[Iorwerth Peate]] in his pioneering book \"The Welsh House''(1940). This was the description of a house where both people and beasts were housed together under the same roof, as portrayed in the Medieval Welsh poem the [[Dream of Rhonabwy]]. Peate thought that the Welsh Longhouse had had a long history and that it occurred in all parts of Wales. This view was challenged by Peter Smith, who had gathered a vast amount of information in his ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', published in 1975. This showed that longhouses were rarely ''one-phase'' buildings and often the byre had been added onto the house. This showed that longhouses were not an upland phenomenon and are noticeably absent from [[Gwynedd]] where ''Snowdonia Houses'' are detached from their farm buildings. The longhouses occur particularly in Ceredigion, Radnorshire and North Powys. Suggett uses the example of Nannerth-ganol near [[Rhayader]] to illustrate the close connection of with the family who lived in this house with [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]], which was particularly prevalent in mid-Wales in the [[Elizabethan]] period.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 83\u201392</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Box framing===\n[[File:Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin 01.JPG|thumb|Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin]]\n[[File:Abernodwydd Farmhouse.jpg|thumb|left|Abernodwydd Montgomeryshire, Farmhouse reconstructed at St Fagans]]\n[[File:St Fagans National History Museum 42.JPG|thumb|left|Abernodwydd Window. St Fagans]]\n\nBox framing is a simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof.  The term box frame is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing other than [[cruck]] framing. The distinction presented here is the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. The timber framework, when exposed will be visible as squares or rectangles panels.  and the houses will also show signs of bracing, particularly at the corners. Many of the Welsh houses have decorative features in the panels, such as [[quatrefoils]] and lozenge or herringbone deceptive woodwork. The panels may also be filled by [[Close studding]].  Box framing was used for the wings of earlier cruck or aisled timber framed houses, but it was not until the mid-16th that it was used as the main construction form for free standing houses in the ''Sub-Medieval tradition'', such as [[Glas Hirfryn|Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin]].\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, box framed houses grew larger and more elaborate.  They would now be built to three or four storeys with tall gabled projecting wings and decorative porches. \n[[File:Plas yn Pentre - geograph.org.uk - 587050.jpg|thumb|Plas yn Pentre near Trevor, Wrexham]]\n[[File:Lymore, Montgomery 01.png|thumb|left|Lymore, Montgomery]]\n[[File:Aberbechan Hall 1796 02.png|thumb|Aberbechan Hall in 1796]]\nA good example of this is Plas yn Pentre at [[Trevor]] near Wrexham. On the dissolution of the abbey in 1536 it came into the possession of the High Sheriff of Denbighshire, Ieuan Edwards. His grandson partially re-built the house in 1634. His initials and the date can be seen carved into the exterior of the west gable.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 291\u20132</ref> Many of these large timber box framed houses have disappeared, but watercolours and prints record [[Aberbechan Hall]] and [[Garthmyl Hall, Berriew]] in [[Montgomeryshire]] and Bychton in Flintshire. \n[[File:Maes Mawr Hall2.jpg|thumb|left|Maes Mawr Hall]] The largest and most impressive of these houses was [[Lymore, Montgomery]], built by Edward, third Lord Herbert of Chirbury, c. 1675 (date on a gable finial but not finished until 1677, a year before Lord Herbert's death) The house had a [[close-studded]] frontage, with an open three-bay [[Renaissance]] [[loggia]] on the ground floor, six gables (later reduced to three), and, rising from the centre, a pyramid-roofed look-out tower or [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]]. While the main house was built in timber, there was extensive use of brick for the inner courtyard and service wings. The hall was not used as the family seat for long, and for most of its existence it was either unoccupied or used by agents of the estate. It was, however, kept in good order and in 1909 the Prince of Wales, who was shooting in the surrounding parkland, was entertained here. In August 1921 the floor collapsed during a Bazaar Sale, and the hall was finally demolished in the 1931.<ref>Lloyd, T.,(1986) The Lost houses of Wales, p. 41.</ref> The Welsh gentry continued to build timber framed houses well into the 17th century, and distinctively these houses, such as [[Maesmawr Hall|Maes Mawr]]  in Montgomeryshire, have very wide entry porches. Box-framed timber houses for the working class continued to be built in mid-Wales into the early part of the 19th century. These later houses and cottages are constructed of very much lighter timber work or [[scantling]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pembrokeshire houses with round chimney stacks===\n[[File:Old Farmhouse at Pwllcaerog, Pembrokeshire.png|thumb|Old Farmhouse at Pwllcaerog, Pembrokeshire]]\n[[File:Rhosson Uchaf Farm, on the lane to St Justinian's, West of St David's - Tyddewi - geograph.org.uk - 886153.jpg|thumb|left|Rhosson Uchaf Farm, on the lane to St Justinian's, West of St David's]]\nThese form an unusual group of ''Sub-Medieval'' Houses which were studied by [[Edward Barnwell|E.L Barnwell]] in 1867\u20131868<ref>Romilly Allen J.

Cottages and houses with these chimneys were mapped by Peter Smith and he showed that they form two groups, one around St Davids and the other to the south of Pembroke. There is a good example of one of these chimneys on the [[Tudor Merchant's House|Merchants House, Tenby]]. Houses with very similar plans and lateral outshoot, but with square chimneys, also cluster on the [[Gower Peninsular]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Lobby entrance and Severn Valley houses===\n[[File:Penarth, a black and white house near Newtown (geograph 2980737).jpg|thumb|Penarth, a black and white house near Newtown (geograph 2980737)]]\n[[File:Talgarth front.jpg|thumb|left|Talgarth front]]\nThe timber-framed lobby entrance house emerged in the mid-16th century in Mid Wales. The majority of these houses occur in [[Montgomeryshire]] with outliers in [[Radnorshire]] and [[Denbighshire]]. The chimney in these houses is generally in the middle of the house. There is no cross passage, unlike the Longhouses and the ''Snowdonia'' houses and instead the main doorway opens into a small lobby on the side of the fireplace. The chimney generally stands between the kitchen and the [[parlour]], and the key feature of these houses is the emphasis placed on the parlour which takes the place of a hall.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 114</ref>  Many of these houses are earlier [[cruck]] framed hall houses, and some are box framed, which have had chimney's inserted and interior floors. An example of this one the best known of the lobby entrance houses is [[Penarth (Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn)]], which stands prominently by the road between [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]] and [[Welshpool]]. This originally appears to have had a cruck framing. It has had two cross wings added and is strikingly decorated with [[close studded]] and herringbone timber work decoration.\n[[File:Trewern Hall 1.jpeg|thumb|Trewern Hall]] \nA development of this is ''Severn Valley Houses'' which particularly congregate along the [[Severn]] Valley in [[Montgomeryshire]] especially between [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Welshpool]].<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 109\u2013132</ref> A typical feature of the Severn Valley houses are the elaborate entry porches to the houses which often have decorative scroll brackets supporting a jettied upper story. These porches often are added features to an earlier timber framed house and lead directly into a lobby entrance. A well known example of the Severn Valley type, which has added timber framed wings to the house is [[Trewern Hall]] near Welshpool. A house which has been dated by dendrochronology is Lower Cil on the outskirts of [[Berriew]]. This is a well-preserved farmhouse. Its left side is 16th-century (the square framing under the render was felled in 1583), probably a hall-house enlarged when the close-studded taller right end was rebuilt in the early 17th century to provide a new parlour and porch, both slightly jettied. The porch has open sides with turned rails, and the original inner door. The remodelling included the typical Severn Valley lobby-entry central chimney, with its triple-moulded brick stacks.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=2394|title = Full Record - Berriew, Lower Cil (or Keel)|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Snowdonia houses===\n[[File:Ty Mawr Wybrnant.JPG|thumb|Ty Mawr Wybrnant]]\n[[File:Amgueddfa Werin Cymru.jpg|thumb|left|Snowdonia Farmhouse- Y Garreg Fawr from Waunfawr, Gwynedd at St Fagans]]\nSnowdonia houses have recently been the subject of considerable study by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] and the Dating Old Welsh Houses Group.<ref>\"Suggett and Dunn\" (2014)</ref> These houses are typical of the ''Sub Medieval'' houses appearing in Wales in the earlier part the 16th century, which are a development from the [[Hall house|Hall House]].

The older cruck construction is now replaced with roofs constructed of trusses and [[purlins]] supported on stone walls. The centrally placed doorway may now be set under a massive stone ''cyclopean'' arch as at [[Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan]] or else under a fan arch of stone slabs as at Y Garreg Fawr. Y Garreg Fawr from [[Waenfawr]] in Caernarfonshire has been re-constructed at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]] and has been dated to 1544<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/buildings/garregfawr/|title=Garreg Fawr Farmhouse|author=|date=|work=museumwales.ac.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\nThe earliest example of a Snowdonia House dated by [[dendrochronology]]  is Dugoed at [[Penmachno]].

In Glamorgan an early example of Renaissance alteration was made to the facade of the outer gatehouse of the now ruined [[Old Beaupre Castle|Old Beaupre]], near [[Cowbridge]] in 1580. This was followed by the more striking Porch in the inner courtyard of 1600 at Old Beaupre.<ref>[[RCAMW]], (1981), ''Glamorgan: The Greater Houses'' HMSO, 46\u201363, pls1-3. {{ISBN|0117007544}}</ref>\nA later and more developed example of Renaissance architecture is [[Ruperra Castle]], built in 1628 for the Welsh soldier [[Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Morgan]]  and the design ideas may originate from his travels on the Continent. The castle is rectangular in layout with round towers at the corners. A feature of Ruperra is the rectangular three light windows with drip moulds, with the centre light higher than the side lights.<ref>[[RCAMW]], (1981), 262\u20138</ref> These windows appear on other Welsh Renaissance houses. The Castle is rectangular with round corner towers and a Porch with a classical doorway. As the result of a fire in 1941 it now stands partly ruined. In the north-east of Wales a very important surviving Renaissance house was [[Plas Teg]] near [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]]. Rectangular in form with rectangular corner towers it is the typical form of Renaissance house seen over much of Europe. A close parallel would be the first phase (unfinished) of [[Drumlanrig Castle]] in Scotland. Another important Renaissance house, demolished in 1973, was Brymbo Hall near [[Wrexham]]. The house was built for John Griffith in 1625 and a Baroque wing was added later in that century. The core of the house was in brick with a fine classical doorway. Fortunately a watercolour by John Ingleby in the National Museum of Wales records this building.<ref>\"Lloyd\", 28</ref> A further example of the Renaissance classicism was the Banqueting Hall at Margam Abbey. This was recorded by [[Thomas Dineley]] in 1684, but only the stone facade now remains, erected in its present position in 1835. It is three bays wide with fluted [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns carrying richly detailed [[entablatures]].<ref>\"Newman\"(1996), 430 Pl.58</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Richard Clough|Sir Richard Clough]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] influence on houses in north-east Wales===\n[[File:Bach-y-Graig.png|thumb|left|Bach-y-Graig, Tremeirchion]]\n[[File:Bach-y-Graig 2.png|thumb|Bach-y-Graig, Tremeirchion c. 1775]]\nThe [[Renaissance]] comes to north-east Wales rather earlier with the building of Bach-y-Graig, at [[Tremeirchion]]  near [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] by [[Richard Clough|Sir Richard Clough]], an extremely wealthy merchant, who established the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in the [[City of London]] with his business partner [[Thomas Gresham|Sir Thomas Gresham]].  Clough had lived in Antwerp, and upon his return to Denbighshire in 1567 he built  ''Bach-y-graig'' and ''Plas Clough''. Bach-y-Graig appears to have served as a lodge-cum-office, with large associated warehouse ranges set around a courtyard, the while the more traditional Plas Clough was clearly intended from the outset as his main house. The houses were built in the Antwerp style by Flemish craftsmen and were the first brick houses in Wales.<ref>There was earlier extensive use of brick in the 1460s at Raglan Castle.</ref>\n[[File:Ruthin Myddelton Arms 1985.jpg|thumb|Ruthin Market Place. Myddelton Arms with triple dormers]]\n[[File:Plas Clough.png|thumb|left|Plas Clough, Denbigh, by Moses Griffith c. 1775]] \nOn the evidence of the similarities of these houses with the Renaissance buildings Antwerp and also the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in London,  a strong case has been made out that their design should be attributed to the Flemish architect [[Hans Hendrik van Paesschen|Henrick van Passe]].<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1980), 42 & 451\u20132.</ref> The [[Crow-stepped gable|Crow stepping]] on the gable, at [[Katheryn of Berain|Plas Clough]] near Denbigh, is typical of Flemish architecture and was widely copied on the grander houses that were being built in north Wales at this time, such as [[Plas Mawr]](1576\u201385) in Conwy and [[Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan|Faenol Fawr]] (1597), near St Asaph. Peter Smith maps the distribution of houses with stepped gables which are concentrated around [[Denbigh]] and [[Ruthin]], [[Conwy]], the [[Menai Straits]] and the southern part of [[Merionethshire]].<ref>''Smith'' (1988), 518\u2013520</ref> He lists a total of 48 examples.  Another feature seen at Bach-y- Graig was the arrangement of multiple dormer windows on the roof.  Another property with three tiers of dormer windows that belonged to Clough was the Myddelton Arms in the market place at Ruthin.<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1980), 154.</ref> Tiered dormer window were also copied on the roof of the older portion of the Manor House in [[Llanfyllin]] in [[Montgomeryshire]].<ref>''Scourfield and Haslam'', (1913), 155</ref>\n\n==Major houses in north Wales==\n[[File:Bodysgallenhallcmichaelhoganlowres.jpg|thumb|Bodysgallen]]\n[[File:Wales mostynhall 2014-05-10.jpg|thumb|left|Mostyn Hall, Flintshire]]\n\nThe major houses built in the 16th and earlier 17th centuries are often difficult to classify on stylistic grounds. The Welsh families who built them often were less interested in the outside display of architectural features and more interested in the interior decoration, particularly elaborate plasterwork, painted walls and elaborately carved woodwork with armorials commemorating their family descent. Many of these houses such as [[Bodysgallen Hall|Bodysgallen]], which was started in 1620 and [[Mostyn Hall]] are an amalgamation of different styles of architecture over many years.  The front is of 1631\u20131632.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 400\u20131.</ref> In the case of [[Nercwys]] Hall near Mold it is known that the contractor who built the Hall was Raffe Booth of Chester and the plans for the house were drawn up by his carpenter Evan Jones. The contract for the building is 1637 and the datestone on the building is 1637.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 405\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:Hen Blas, Llanasa by Moses Griffith, 1776.png|thumb|left|Hen Blas, Llanasa from a watercolour of c. 1776]]\n[[File:The Hall, Gloddaeth Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1356085.jpg|thumb|The Hall, Gloddaeth Hall Painted heraldic [[dais]]]]\nThe influence of English architectural fashion can also be seen in Hen Blas, at Llanasa in Flintshire.

As Edward Hubbard remarks<ref name = hubbard383>{{harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p= 383}}.</ref> Hen Blas is reminiscent of houses in the limestone belt of England.\n[[File:Gloddaeth Hall (St.David's College) - geograph.org.uk - 1356077.jpg|thumb|Gloddaeth near Llandudno]]\n\nAnother notable house is [[Gloddaeth Hall|Gloddaeth]] near [[Llandudno]], which retains its hall still up the original hammer-beam roof and also a painted [[dais]] above the high table at the end of the hall.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\",(2009),451\u2013454</ref>\n [[File:Y Faenol Old Hall - geograph.org.uk - 17257.jpg|thumb|left|Y Faenol Old Hall]] \n[[File:Plas Mawr.jpg|thumb|left| Plas Mawr, Conway]]\nThe Old Hall at Y Faenol (Y Vaynol), [[Port Dinorwic]] is an '''E''' shaped building consisting of low 16th-century blocks with a more ornate right wing, which was probably added in the 1660s by Sir Griffith Williams. This has a [[crow stepped]] gable.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\",(2009), 371</ref>\n\n[[File:Gatehouse tower at Great Porthamel near Talgarth.JPG|thumb|Gatehouse tower at Great Porthamel near Talgarth]]\nA feature of many of the larger houses of the 16th century is that they are set round walled courtyards that were entered through an arched gatehouse. The most notable examples of these which are set in the countryside are Corsygedol in Merionethshire, Cefnamwlch near Tudweiliog and Rhiwaedog near Bala.  The impressive example at Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire is now only known from earlier drawings and the gatehouse at Madryn on the Llyn survives, but not the house.\n\n[[Plas Mawr]] in [[Conwy|Conway]] is one of the most impressive surviving courtyard houses of this period, which has recently been restored by [[CADW]]. An [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] townhouse, dating from the 16th century. The property was built by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]], a member of the local gentry, following his marriage to his first wife, Dorothy Griffith. Plas Mawr occupied a plot of land off Conwy's High Street and was constructed in three phases between 1576 and 1585 at a total cost of around \u00a3800.<ref name=\"Turner 1995 195\">{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=195}}</ref>\nThere three phases of house construction \u2013 1576\u201377, 1580 and 1585 \u2013 were probably [[Project management|overseen]] by several different senior craftsmen, possibly working to an original plan determined by a surveyor or mason working at the English royal court.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}</ref> Judging by the details of the roof design, a single master carpenter may have been used for all three parts of the build.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=13}}</ref>\nOther buildings, such as stables formed part of the courtyard.  The courtyard layout of these houses in north Wales may be compared with similar houses of the Elizabethan Period in England, particularly brick built houses in East Anglia, such as [[Erwarton|Erwarton Hall]] in Suffolk. It should noted that there many examples of houses with gatehouses and courtyards in south Wales, such as Great Porthamel near [[Talgarth]] in [[Breconshire]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Plasterwork, painted interiors and woodwork===\n[[File:Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan 14.JPG|thumb|left|Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan. South wing interior. Lloyd Armorials of 1597 over fireplace.]]\nGreat attention was paid to the interior decoration of the Great Houses. Extensive use was made of decorative plasterwork and the restoration of the plasterwork which has been painted to show the original colour at [[Plas Mawr]] in Conway gives some idea as to how this would have appeared. Where expensive wallhangings or tapestries could not be afforded, extensive painted imitations would be used. Wooded panelling and armourial carving still survive in some houses, often over fireplaces. A carved panelled room has been returned to [[Gwydir Castle]] and a carved over-mantle at [[Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan|Faenol Fawr]] records the building of the house in 1597 and the armourials of the Lloyd family.

Brick makers tended to be itinerant until the mid-19th century, digging clay and firing bricks took place close to the building that was to be constructed.<ref>A detailed account of this is given for the building of Caersws Workhouse between 1837 and 40. Mont Colls</ref> One of the more permanent brickyards was the Herbert's (Earls of Chirbury) brickyard at Stalloe near Montgomery, which would have been the likely source for the impressive ''New Build'' at [[Montgomery Castle]] and for large quantities of bricks used in building of the service wings at [[Lymore, Montgomery|Lymore near Montgomery]]  1664\u201367 and also for 17th-century brick-faced town houses in [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]] and possibly Welshpool. The earliest use of brick in the 16th century was for the construction of massive chimney stacks of ''Stellar'' form with multiple flues within timber-framed houses. These stacks would have greatly reduced the risk of fire, and the study by Peter Smith of the distribution of these stacks show them to be clustered along the Welsh border from Montgomeryshire northwards.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 470\u20132</ref>\nWhile brick making may have started by Flemish brick makers working for Sir Richard Clough, building in brick was also becoming established in Shropshire<ref>Moran M.(2003), ''Vernacular Buildings of Shropshire''Logaston Press,</ref> and in Cheshire.

Early market halls were placed in the market area with an open area below for the market traders and an upper area that was used as a court room and council chamber. In the major County towns these buildings would also have been the meeting place of the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]] which as well as holding the [[Assizes]] supervised the county administration, and these halls were often known as the [[Shire]] Hall.

The original design of the Town Hall shows the ground floor market space was open with five bay arcades. The upper floor housed the Council Chamber and Court of Great Sessions and Quarter Sessions. In 1828 [[Thomas Penson]], at the expense of Lord Clive, raised the roof level over the first floor and introduced sash-windows, rebuilding the pedimented gable, but without the coat of Arms.  An extension was added at the rear with rounded quadrant corners and was tied in by extending the string courses around the building, adding a matching [[pediment]] to that at the front. The arcade arches were infilled with glazing and bricks in 1887, and the attractive clock tower was added in 1921.\n[[File:9 The Market Hall HTsmall.jpg|thumb|Market Hall at Monmouth 1837-9]]\n[[File:Guildhall Square, Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|left|The Guildhall, Carmarthen 1767\u201377]]\nAn important building, although altered,  in [[Palladian]] style is [[Sir Robert Taylor]]'s Guildhall at Carmarthen, built between 1767 and 1777.

Nash left London in 1784 to live in [[Carmarthen]], where his mother had retired to, her family being from the area. He set up with Samuel Simon Saxon, another London architect,<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 852.</ref> to work as building contractors and suppliers of building materials. Nash's London buildings had been standard Georgian terrace houses, but it was in Wales that he matured as an architect. His first major work was Carmarthen Prison  (1789\u20131792). The prison was planned by the penal reformer [[John Howard]] and Nash developed this into the finished building. He went on to design the prisons at Cardigan (1791\u20131796) and Hereford (1792\u20131796). In 1789 St David's Cathedral was suffering from structural problems, the west front was leaning forward by one foot, Nash was called in to survey the structure and develop a plan to save the building. His solution completed in 1791,  was to demolish the upper part of the facade and rebuild it with two large but inelegant flying buttresses.\nIn 1790 Nash met [[Uvedale Price]], of Downtown Castle, whose theories of the [[Picturesque]] would influence Nash's town planning. Price commissioned Nash to design Castle House Aberystwyth (1795). Its plan took the form of a right-angled triangle, with an octagonal tower at each corner, sited on the very edge of the sea.<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 687\u2013689</ref>\n[[File:Llanacheron.JPG|thumb|left|Llanerchaeron]]\nOne of Nash's most important developments was a series of medium-sized country houses that he designed in Wales; these developed the villa designs of his teacher Sir Robert Taylor. Most of these villas consist of a roughly square plan with a small entrance hall with a staircase offset in the middle to one side, around which are placed the main rooms, there is then a less prominent servants' quarters in a wing attached to one side of the villa. The buildings are usually only two floors in height, the elevations of the main block are usually symmetrical. One of the finest of these villas is [[Llanerchaeron]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} and at least a dozen villas were designed throughout south Wales.\n[[File:Whitson Court, Whitson, Newport, Monmouthshire c.1890.jpg|thumb|left|Whitson Court, Whitson, Newport, Monmouthshire c. 1890]] \nOthers, in Pembrokeshire, include Ffynone, built for the Colby family at Boncath near Manordeifi, and Foley House, built for the lawyer Richard Foley (brother of Admiral Sir Thomas Foley) at Goat Street in Haverfordwest.<ref>Michael Mansbridge (1991),  ''John Nash: A complete Catalogue 1752\u20131835'' Rizzoli/Phaidon, pp 44\u201345</ref>  Villas of this type were widely imitated in Wales, particularly by [[Joseph Bromfield]] of Shrewsbury.\nAs Nash developed his architectural practice it became necessary to employ draughtsmen, the first in the early 1790s was [[Augustus Charles Pugin]], then a bit later in 1795 [[John Adey Repton]] son of [[Humphrey Repton]]. It was presumably through Nash that Repton gained commissions in Wales, such as [[Stanage Park]] in Radnorshire.\n[[File:Clytha Park, The Lodge at the main gate - geograph.org.uk - 1432545.jpg|thumb|Clytha Park, 1797]]\nIn 1796 Nash spent most of his time working in London; this was a prelude to his return to the capital in 1797. At this time Nash designed the delicate Strawberry Hill [[Gothic revival]] gateway to [[Clytha Park]] near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire,<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 41</ref>  and also his alterations in Gothic Revival style in 1794 to [[Hafod Uchtryd]] for Thomas Johnes at Devil's Bridge, Cardiganshire<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 48\u201349.</ref> Also in c. 1794\u201395 he advised on the paving, lighting and water supply in [[Abergavenny]] and designed an elegant market building.<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 49.</ref> Other work included Whitson Court near Newport. After his return to London, was to continue to design houses in Wales which were to include Harpton Court in Radnorshire, which, apart from the service wing was demolished in 1956.<ref name=\"Mansbridge, 1991, 122\">Mansbridge, (1991), 122.</ref> In 1807 he drew up plans for the re-building of [[Hawarden Castle (18th century)|Hawarden Castle]] with Gothic battlements and towers, but the plan appears to have been modified by another architect when it was carried out.<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 135\u201336</ref> About 1808 he designed Monachty near [[Aberaeron]]. and later drew up plans for work at [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]].<ref name=\"Mansbridge, 1991, 122\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Prisons and workhouses===\n\n[[File:The Roundhouse, Ruabon - geograph.org.uk - 589787.jpg|thumb|left|The Roundhouse ([[village lock-up]]), Ruabon]] \nIn the latter part of the 18th century, as the result of [[Prison reform]] new prisons came to be built in most of the Welsh [[County town]]s. The reforms were the result of the work of [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], who in 1777 published  ''The State of the Prisons''<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}</ref>  He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. This was followed by the [[Penitentiary Act]] which was passed in 1779. This act was in implemented in each Welsh county by the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]] and which led to the building of many new prisons across Wales. These included the gaols built in Carmarthen and Cardigan by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and the gaols at [[Caernarfon]] (1793), [[Ruthin]] (1785) and [[Flint]](1775) by [[Joseph Turner (architect)|Joseph Turner]].<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 998</ref> Most of these prisons were closed in the 1870s, but the Ruthin gaol, now used as the Denbighshire County Record Office is remarkably well preserved. The Anglesey Gaol at [[Beaumaris]] came later in 1828\u20131829 by the architects [[Joseph Hansom|Hansom]] and [[Edward Welch|Welch]]. This incorporates many of the innovations of the [[Millbank Prison|Milbank Penitentiary]] in London of 1812\u20131821 with wings, a massive [[curtilage]] wall and a central glass [[cupola]] for the oversight of the prison complex.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\" (2009), 107\u20138</ref> \n[[File:Montgomery Gaol Gateway IMG 2598.JPG|thumb|Montgomery Gaol Gateway]]\nThis plan was developed for the Montgomeryshire County gaol at [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]] by the County Surveyor [[Thomas Penson]], c. 1830\u201332. Brick faced with stone.  The tall octagonal governor's house with the chapel above, was at the centre of four radiating three- and two-storey wings. One of the yards was fitted with a tread-mill. The gatehouse was built into the wall to face a new approach in 1866 by [[J W Poundley and D Walker|J.W. Poundley]]. Powerful ashlar triumphal arch, with four giant semi-rusticated pilasters. The Gaol was closed in 1878 and all that now remains, apart from the gatehouse, is the Governor's House and the high wall of one cell block.<ref>Haslam R '\"Powys:The Buildings of Wales'\", (Nikolaus Pevsner advisory editor),1978,167,</ref> \nPenson was also to use this design for the workhouses at [[Llanfyllin]] and [[Caersws]] in Montgomeryshire.\n{{clear}}\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Old police station, Caernarfon (geograph 2303478).jpg|Old police station, Caernarfon\nFile:Central Block and East Wing of the Old Caernarfon Prison - geograph.org.uk - 232726.jpg|Central Block and East Wing of the Old Caernarfon Prison\nFile:Beaumaris Gaol.jpg|Beaumaris Gaol\nFile:Carchar Rhuthun Ruthin Gaol Grade 18 Star.JPG|Ruthin Gaol\nFile:Llanfyllin Workhouse 02.png|Llanfyllin Workhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Neoclassicism and Greek revival architecture==\n\n===North Wales===\n[[File:Baron Hill, Beaumaris.png|thumb|Baron Hill, Beaumaris by Samuel Wyatt 1776-9]]\n[[File:Kinmel Park.png|thumb|left|Kinmel Park, St Asaph, watercolour by John Ingleby 1794]]\nNeoclassical architecture came to north Wales mainly as a result of the influence of [[Samuel Wyatt]].  Wyatt had worked for [[Robert Adam]], the leading [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical architect]] when he became the clerk of Works at [[Kedleston Hall]] in 1759. Between 1776 and 1779 he remodelled Baron Hill at [[Beaumaris]] on Anglesey for Viscount Bulkely, while his brother became estate manager for the Pennants at [[Penrhyn Castle|Penrhyn]]. Colvin remarks that Wyatt specialised in the designing of medium-sized country houses in an elegant and restrained neo-classical manner. Characteristic features of his houses were [[astylar]] elevations with prominent bowed projections which were domed and were either single or in pairs. His windows were often tripartite and overarched.<ref>\"Colvin\",(1995), pp, 1124\u20138</ref> He rarely deviated from the neo-classical, though he did a gothic revival building at [[Penrhyn Castle]] which was replaced by Hopper's Neo-Romanesque Castle. At [[Kinmel Hall|Kinmel Park]] near St Asaph, around 1790, he built a stylish house for the Rev Edward Hughes, who derived great wealth from the development of the [[Parys Mountain|Parys Copper mines on Anglesey]]. This house had a bowed front and panels with classical swags, possibly of [[Coade stone]]. It was burnt down in 1841, but fortunately it was recorded in a watercolour by John Ingleby in 1794.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 280</ref> A further house in this style was the Old Bishop's Palace in [[St Asaph]] which was probably by Samuel Wyatt,<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1986), Pl.72</ref> while at Brynbella in [[Tremeirchion]] a London surveyor, Clement Mead built Brynbella, for [[Dr Johnson]]'s friend [[Mrs Thrale]]. Bryn Bella was built between 1792 and 1795 with an [[ashlar]] facade and double bays and wings with pediments on either side.<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1986), 450\u20131, Pl.74</ref> Another very fine bow fronted house, [[Gresford]] Lodge near Wrexham,  was built for John Parry by [[James Wyatt]], the brother of Samuel Wyatt around 1790.<ref>\"Lloyd\" (1989) pg 26, Pl.</ref> This house was domed over the bow front with a semicircular [[portico]] with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns and tripartite overarched windows.

Keck who worked from [[Kings Stanley]] Gloucestershire may have worked with [[Sir Robert Taylor]] who would have introduced him to clients in Wales. He built a bow fronted house for Thomas Mansel Talbot (1747\u20131813) adjacent to [[Penrice Castle]]  in Glamorgan in 1773\u20131780.<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 569\u201370.</ref> This building, though earlier than Samuel Wyatt's work in north Wales, lacks features such as the overarched windows.  However, the Orangery he also built for Thomas Mansel Talbot at [[Margam Abbey]] from 1787 to 1790,  exhibits a much more refined appreciation of Neo-classicism and may well be considered the best example of this architectural style in Wales. It is the largest Orangery in the British Isles of 17 continuous bays with [[vermiculated]] [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]] to the more formal swags and arched windows.<ref>\"Newman\" (1995), 429</ref>\n[[File:Piercefield House 1840.jpg|thumb|left|Piercefield House 1840]]\n[[File:Piercefield House - geograph.org.uk - 888334.jpg|thumb|The ruined Piercefield House, Monmouthshire]]\nA house of considerable importance was [[Piercefield House|Piercefield]] between [[Chepstow]] and [[St Arvans]].

Thomas Penson had trained under [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] in Chester, and his most notable building in the classical style was the Flannel Exchange in [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]] of 1832, which although still standing, was badly defaced by its conversion into a cinema in the early 20th century. The Shrewsbury architects, [[Joseph Bromfield]] and the Haycock family had been influenced by the talented [[Thomas Farnolls Pritchard|Farnolls Pritchard]], the original designer of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]]. While this group of architects worked in various styles, they particularly developed the classical style in Wales. [[Edward Haycock, Sr.|Edward Haycock]]'s most important works were [[Glynllifon]] near [[Caernarfon]], the facade to [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] stables and [[Clytha Park]] near [[Abergavenny]],  and the laying out of the small town of [[Aberaeron]] in [[Ceredigion]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Public buildings===\n[[File:Swansea Museum - geograph.org.uk - 1485806.jpg|thumb|left|Swansea Museum]]\n[[File:Caernarfon Crown Court.jpg|thumb|Caernarfon Shire Hall /Crown Court]]\n\nThe Greek revival style was chosen for many public buildings in Wales.

Hensol had three storied east and west wings added with tower-like semi-octagonal bays which were [[Window|fenestrated]] with pointed gothic windows and surmounted by battlements.<ref>RCAHMW, (1981), ''Glamorgan: The Greater Houses'', HMSO pg.339\u2013340.</ref> It has been suggested that this very early Gothic architecture was the work of [[Richard Morris (architect)|Richard Morris]]<ref>CADW, Listed Buildings Schedule, ref. 72/D/7(2)</ref> who also designed [[Clearwell Castle]]<ref>Rowan A (1970) ''Clearwell Castle, Gloucestershire'', in Colvin H and Harris J, ''The Country Seat: Studies in the History of the British Country House'', Allen Lane, London, pp. 145\u2013149.</ref>  in Gloucestershire about 1728.<ref>\"Colvin\", 3rd ed, pp 665\u2013669</ref> One of the towers at Hensol is dated 1735 and much of the evidence for this early phase at Hensol has been disguised by the later gothicisation of the building.\n\nAnother example of the simple Gothic revival style was Gnoll near Neath. This was a remodelling, starting in 1776, of an existing house for Sir Herbert Mackworth, owner of a local copper works. It had a crenulated parapet and round towers at the two corners of the frontage.  The architect was [[John Johnson (architect, born 1732)|John Johnson]] an Essex architect who had been associated with Mackworth's banking interests in London.\nFollowing this,  examples of [[Strawberry Hill, London|Strawberry Hill]] Gothic start appearing in Wales, the most significant of which was [[Hafod Uchtryd|Hafod]]. The first stage of Hafod was started 1786 by [[Thomas Baldwin (architect)|Thomas Baldwin of Bath]] for [[Thomas Johnes]], in a Gothic revival style with gothic window,  battlements and pinnacles and then in 1793\u20131794 [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] added a top-lit galleried library and a 300&nbsp;ft long conservatory.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006), 474\u20135. This phase of the building was destroyed by a fire in 1807</ref>\nAnother early pioneer of the Gothic style was [[James Wyatt]] who was employed by the Earl of Uxbridge to build [[Beaudesert (House)|Beaudesert]] in Staffordshire in the Gothic style in 1771\u20131772. The Earl was to employ him again at [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] on Anglesey to rebuild the West front and the interior in a Gothic style from 1793 to 1799<ref>\"Haslam R et al.\", (2009), 153</ref> Wyatt worked with the Lichfield architect James Potter and the style of plasterwork lacks the lightness of Strawberry Hill gothic. \nPlas Newydd was followed by the more remarkable Gothic mansion at [[Garth (Guilsfield)|Garth]] at [[Guilsfield]] in [[Montgomeryshire]], built for Devereux Mytton, probably in the late 1790s.<ref>This work should be post 1794, when the old house at Garth was recorded by John Ingleby in a watercolour, now in the National Library of Wales.</ref> \nAnother house with Strawberry Hill Gothic features was [[Bodelwyddan Castle]] which had a Gothic wing and gothic interior added between 1802 and 1808 by an unknown architect.  During this period a number of other houses in Wales were given Gothic facades with arched pointed windows, such as Llewenni in Denbighshire.<ref>\"Hubbard\",  249 and Howell P. (1977), 'Country Life', Vol 162, pg. 1966</ref> At [[Hawarden Castle (18th century)|Hawarden Castle]] the [[Palladian]]  house, on a different site to the medieval castle, was transformed by [[Thomas Cundy (senior)|Thomas Cundy]] in 1809\u20131810 for [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet|Sir Stephen Richard Glynne]]. It was refronted and [[machicolations]], towers and turrets were added.  A west wing was added with gothic windows.<ref>\"Hubbard\" pg362-363.</ref> At Rhiwlas, near [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] the ancient house was re-cased as a Gothic castle in 1809 with three storeys and three polygonal towers, but the house was largely replaced by new house in 1954.

Possibly the best example of this is [[Clytha Castle]] the work of architect and garden designer John Davenport.<ref>''Newman'' (2000)  192</ref> This style was a less archaeologically correct form of Gothic revival and was widely used in Wales during the period 1780 to about 1810. Greater emphasis was placed on prominent arrow slits in round towers, blanked [[quatrefoil]] windows and stepped and angled battlements on gables. The earliest example of this may be the re-building of [[Penrhyn Castle]], sometime before 1782 by [[Samuel Wyatt]] for Richard Pennant, who was to develop the [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] slate quarries. This building is only known from drawings by [[Moses Griffiths]], though parts of it were incorporated into [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]'s rebuilding of Penrhyn. While it shows the features of this evolving style, the doorway shows the influence of Strawberry Hill gothic.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\"(2009), 399</ref>\nFolly Gothic was a style which was widely adopted for park gates and lodges and for small houses sited in picturesque positions in locations frequented by tourists.\nA good example is Ogwen Bank near [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], built by Lord Penhryn, possibly to a design by Samuel Wyatt,  for visitors to the Ogwen falls.<ref>E Pugh, (1816), ''Cambria Depicta'', pg 104-5</ref> In the [[Montgomeryshire]]  at [[Berriew]] Bodheilin was built was built in a prominent position overlooking the valley of the river [[Severn]].

In Montgomeryshire iron framed Gothic windows were used to embellish [[vernacular]] houses. \nGrander houses such as Dol-Llys in Llanidloes, built for George Mears around 1800, by an unknown architect, but in the ''villa'' style of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], had wooden Gothic windows.<ref>C E Vaughan Owen, ''An Artwystli Notebook'', part 1, p6. and http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-8388-dol-llys-hall-llanidloes</ref>\nOne of the most eye-catching gothic follies in Wales is [[Paxton's Tower]]. Built by [[William Paxton (MP)|Sir William Paxton]] (1745\u20131824), Paxton made his first fortune while with the [[East India Company|HEIC]] in Calcutta with [[Sezincote House|Charles Cockerell]], brother of the architect. He purchased the [[National Botanic Garden of Wales|Middleton Hall]] estate about 1790 and built this tower 1808.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006), 239</ref> Designed by [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] who also worked for Paxton in the development of [[Tenby]]. The tower was built to commemorate Nelson's death at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. The tower is 36 feet high. The lower part of the tower is triangular in shape with a turret at each corner and on the first floor there is a banqueting room. On the second floor there is a hexagonal prospect room surrounded by roof terraces.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Castellated Gothic===\n[[File:Hensol Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Hensol Castle]]\nCastellated Gothic was a style that emerged in Wales following the Napoleonic Wars and has been little studied, although a considerable number of Country Houses were built in this style up to about 1870. It is largely derived from the earlier Castellated Gothic Mansions built Robert Adam in Scotland<ref>Rowan A. (1985) ed., Robert Adam  ''Designs for Castles and Country Villas''.</ref> and Adam was also the designer of one house built in Wales, [[Wenvoe Castle]] in Glamorgan in 1776/7 of which only one wing of the building now survives.<ref>\"Newman\"(1995), pg 645</ref> This ''Welsh'' style of Castellated Gothic lacks the historical precision of detailing seen in ''Strawberry Hill'' Gothic, but it has borrowed the turrets and battlements some Medieval Castles in Wales such as [[Raglan Castle|Raglan]] and the earlier [[Cardiff Castle]]. In some cases Medieval castles which were still inhabited were by re-built in this style. [[Powis Castle]] on the outskirts of [[Welshpool]] was extensively re-built with new windows and battlements in the castellatted gothic style by [[Sir Robert Smirke]] between 1815 and 1818.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", (2013), 244.</ref> while Ruthin Castle was rebuilt in this style firstly in 1826 and then more extensively between 1848 and 1853 by [[Henry Clutton]]. In many instances these Castellated Gothic houses, such as Llanerchyddol near Welshpool, have not been attributed with certainty to any architect, and are likely to have been the work of a local architect or one working in Shrewsbury. The main features of these houses are the prominent [[Machicolation|machicolated]]  towers and the horizontal, rather than vertical, architectural composition. Rough hewn stone rather than [[ashlar]] was often used and rectangular windows under ''Tudoresque'' drip moulds.[[File:Bodelwyddan castle view2 arp.jpg|thumb|left|Bodelwyddan Castle, Denbighshire]]\n[[File:Gatehouse to Brynkinalt - geograph.org.uk - 165751.jpg|thumb|Gatehouse to Brynkinalt by Joseph Bromfield]]\nInitially older houses such as [[Bodelwyddan Castle|Bodelwyddan]]  in Denbighshire or [[Hensol Castle]] had large extensions added to them. At Stanage Park in Radnorshire the design has been attributed to [[John Adey Repton]], but he employed as the building contractor [[John Hiram Haycock]]. Haycock, from Shrewsbury, was equally competent as an architect and may have contributed to appearance of the building. This has led Thomas Lloyd to suggest that the similar appearance of Glandyfi (c. 1812) in Ceredigion, may also be the work of Haycock.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006,471</ref>  At Brynkinalt in Denbighshire the addition of castellated towers and other feature (now removed) on a late 17th-century house was the work of another Shrewsbury architect [[Joseph Bromfield]].<ref>\"Colvin\"</ref> However, the Gothic entrance gate that can be attributed to Bromfield survives.\n[[File:Cyfartha Castle.jpg|thumb|Cyfartha Castle]]\nCastellated Gothic was the style employed by [[Robert Lugar]]  when he built [[Cyfarthfa Castle]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] for the iron master William Crawshay, in 1824\u20131825. It is two-storied and battlemented with a turreted entrance porch which leads into a Gothic entrance hall with ribbed ceiling.<ref>\"Newman\", (2000), 442\u20133.</ref> Robert Luger was also employed at Maesllwch, [[Glasbury]] from 1829 to 1850. The main portion of this house was demolished in 1951 leaving the eastern tower, service wing and later tower.<ref>\"Lloyd\" (1985), pg. 45</ref> Between 1818 and 1830 [[John Preston Neale]] published his ''Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland'' in which he included several examples of Castellated houses in Wales, showing this had become an established style. Further prints of Welsh castellated mansions were included in the Rev [[Francis Orpen Morris]]'s ''The County Seats of the Noblemen and Gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland''  which was published in six volumes of coloured lithographs in 1870; and also in the engravings in Thomas Nicholas' ''Annals and antiquities of the counties and county families of Wales; containing a record of all ranks of the gentry \u2026 with many ancient pedigrees and memorials of old and extinct families'' published in two volumes by [[Longmans]] in 1872.  These volumes give the impression that both the established gentry and the [[Nouveau riche]] bankers and industrialists in Wales needed to justify a legitimacy for building in this style and the expenditure they were lavishing on them.<ref>J.

The bay window was added in 1833 and in 1841 the Edward Haycock took over as architect, remodelling the interior after a fire and adding a Neo-Norman porch to the rectangular tower. He continued expanding the house until 1867.

Plas Rhianfa in [[Llandegfan]] near Beaumaris overlooks the [[Menai Strait |Menai Straights]]. The architect was Charles Verelst of Liverpool, who was also known as [[Charles Reed (architect) |Charles Reed]], but the building was inspired by [[Sarah Elizabeth Hay-Williams|Lady Sarah Hay Williams]] of [[Bodelwyddan Castle]], who commissioned the building for her two daughters. Lady Hay Williams, an artist, had sketched the Chateau of the Loire, and presumably greatly influenced the designs of her architect. (She may also have been influenced by [[Harry Longeville Jones]] who was living close to Beaumaris at the time and was a writer on French Gothic architecture.) The house is described as a forest of steep French roofs covered in fish tail slates, and a skyline fretted with curved and straight pitches and spires, which are level with the road at the back. On the seaward front narrow drum towers with conical roofs.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\"(2009, 150)</ref> Inside there are highly decorative fireplaces, similar to those in Bodelwyddan Castle, which can be seen as precursors to similar decorative work at Cardiff Castle by [[William Burges]]. Stylistically this is the architecture that [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]] was pioneering in France and it predates the publication of [[Henry Clutton]]'s ''Remarks\u2026..on the domestic architecture of France'' which was published in 1853.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Castellated Gothic and Tudor Gothic gallery===\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Portmeirioncastle.jpg|Castell Deudraeth near Portmeirion\nFile:Neale(1818) p5.268 - Dinevor Castle, Carmarthenshire.jpg|Dinevor Castle, Carmarthenshire.

The use of terracotta was largely limited to Great Houses in Eastern England.<ref>Wright J, (1972), Brick Building in England up to 1550, Baker, London, pp178-195.</ref> Then in the 1830s and 1840s a number of architects started sourcing terracotta from the brickyards that were associated with coal mines in the West Midlands.\n[[File:Garthmyl Hall 04.JPG|thumb|left|Garthmyl Hall with the Gold/Naylor Coat of Arms in terracotta set in the pediment]] One of the earliest architects to make use of this source was the Welsh architect [[Thomas Penson]], who worked from offices in Oswestry. There appears to be good evidence that he sourced his terracotta from the brickyards which were associated with the [[Oswestry]] coalfield at [[Morda]] and [[Trefonen]] on the Welsh border.<ref>\"Stratton\", (1993). pg. 51</ref> Penson used terracotta moulding for church architecture, most notably St Davids, Newtown and [[Christ Church, Welshpool]]. As yet no examples the use of the terracotta from these brickyards for domestic buildings is known, although the Trefonen brickyard, which was described as a terracotta works,   was later owned by the railway engineer [[Thomas Savin]] and may have been used for some of his projects. [[James Kellaway Colling]] used extensive terracotta decoration for [[Garthmyl Hall, Berriew]] in Berriew in Montgomeryshire. This was almost certainly sourced from [[John Marriott Blashfield|J M Blashfield]]'s terracotta works at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]. \n[[File:Brick building at Pen-y-bont - geograph.org.uk - 768572.jpg|thumb|left| Offices and Gatehouse to J C Edwards Terra cotta works at Pen-y-bont]]\n[[File:Pierhead Building Cardiff Bay 01.jpg|thumb|Pierhead Building Cardiff, detailing]]\nFrom about this time terracotta production with matching bricks started to be produced on a large scale in the [[Wrexham]] area in association with mines of the [[north Wales Coalfield]]. This was centred on [[Ruabon]] and many companies sprang up. The last of these to go out of business was J. C Dennis in 2010. However the most important and best known of these companies was J C Edwards, who about 1867 opened up the Pen-y-bont brickyard. This brickyard produced a distinctive rich red brick and terracotta ornamentation that can be readily recognised. This was recognised and used by some of the leading architects of the period, most notably [[Alfred Waterhouse]] who used it for the [[Prudential plc|Prudential Insurance Offices]] in both London and Birmingham. Examples of Ruabon terracotta can be seen on buildings, particularly banks and public institutions throughout England, but as might be expected, terracotta was particularly popular in Wales.  Most towns having several examples often including banks,  shops and sometimes houses.\n\n[[File:Wyvern Pierhead Building Cardiff Bay (2991221537).jpg|thumb|Wyvern decorative panel, Pierhead Building,  Cardiff]]\n[[File:Tower above the entrance to John Summers' Building - geograph.org.uk - 404711.jpg|thumb|left|Tower above the entrance to John Summers' Building 1907]]\nOne of the most iconic Terracotta buildings in Wales is the Pierhead building at Cardiff Docks, adjacent to the Welsh Assembly building.

Ruskin and Street advocated styles of architecture which used striking colour combinations and were modelled on Venetian and north Italian Gothic architecture. There is little evidence of Ruskinian Gothic in Wales, but with the notable exception of Cardigan Town Hall, but it did give rise to the use the use of [[Polychrome brickwork]]. Cardigan Town Hall was designed by [[Robert Jewell Withers]] and built in 1858-60.  \n[[File:Plas Castell.jpg|thumb|left|Plas Castell Gatehouse, Denbigh]]\n[[File:Terraced housing, Kerry - geograph.org.uk - 634432.jpg|thumb|Terraced housing, Kerry, Montgomeryshire]]\nThe use of patterned or polychrome brickwork, sometimes associated terracotta was popular in the towns in Montgomeryshire and North Eastern Wales in the 1870s and 1880s. A striking example is the Plas Castell Gatehouse at Denbigh, a Tudoresque [[Machicolation|machicolated]] tower with bars of yellow brick contrasting with the red bricks. The tower was built in 1882.  In [[Kerry, Powys|Kerry]], Montgomeryshire the estate architects [[J W Poundley and D Walker]] produced an unusual composition of a terrace of houses built for the [[Leighton Hall, Powys|Naylors]] next to the former Kerry workhouse. The red bricks are punctuated by a double string of white brick and a pattern of white and black bricks below the eaves and for the upper voussoirs. The use of curved bricks in the voussoirs give the impression of an Egyptian [[pharonic]] head-dress.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", 126-7</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Italianate style architecture===\n[[File:Llandovery Town Hall 01.JPG|thumb|left|Llandovery Town Hall, by R K Penson, 1857-8]]\n[[File:Penoyre House, near Brecon - geograph.org.uk - 250800.jpg|thumb|Penoyre House, near Brecon]]\n[[File:Parc Howard museum - geograph.org.uk - 143410.jpg|thumb|Parc Howard museum 1882-6]]\nPrompted by Queen Victoria's [[Osbourne House]], the Italianate style of architecture became popular in the second half of the 19th century. Features of this stye include [[belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] towers and roofs with a shallow slope and wide eaves.  In Wales[[Richard Kyrke Penson|R. K Penson]] was a leading exponent of the style. Penson had an extensive practice in the south of Wales, particular in church building and restoration, but examples of his use of the Italianate style include the Town Hall at [[Llandovery]] and the gate lodge to [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]]. The style was popular for country houses in Carmarthenshire and include the now demolished Pant Glas at [[Llanfynydd]] and Gellideg at [[Llandyfaelog]].<ref>\"Lloyd\" (1989), 269</ref> Pant Glas was built in 1850 and Gellideg in 1852. The architect for the latter being William Wesley Jenkins.<ref>\"Lloyd\" (1989), 66\u201367</ref> A later example of the Italianate style is the Parc Howard Museum on the outskirts of [[Llanelli]], originally known as Bryncaerau Castle.

Seddon was a London architect who developed an extensive practice in south Wales. Initially he worked with John Prichard from 1853 to 1859 and then with [[John Coates Carter]], who had an office in Cardiff, until 1904.  Seddon was surveyor to Llandaff Cathedral and most of his work was church building and parsonages for the Llandaff Diocese.<ref>Antonia Brodie ed (2001)\u2018\u2019\u2019Directory of British Architects, 1834\u20131914\u2019\u2019\u2019: Vol. 2 (L-Z), 575-6, . British Architectural Library, Royal Institute of British Architects Continuum 2001.</ref> However he built some notable country houses such as Llanilar at Abermad in [[Ceredigion]] in 1870\u20131872<ref>\"Lloyd\" (2006), 530</ref> and most notably the Old College Building of Aberystwyth University. The Old College Building is on the seafront and replaced Castle House, which had been built for [[Uvedale Price]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] in 1791\u20131794. Castle House had been bought by the railway entrepreneur [[Thomas Savin]] in 1864 and he employed Seddon to rebuild it as a hotel. Following Savin's bankruptcy in 1866, it was purchased by the future university and until 1890 Seddon together with his partner John Coates Carter continued to rebuild and extend the building. [[The Builder]] described it as ''one of the most original and characteristic monuments of the [[Gothic Revival]]'', while Thomas Lloyd writes ''Seddon's originality lies in his very fluid use of curves and complex geometrical forms, and in the blurring of angles and joints, syncopation that has something of [[Art Nouveau]]''. Seddon mixes detail of [[Early English Period|Early English]] with Venetian and French late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic Architecture]]. The stone used comes from Cefn at [[Minera]], dressed with [[Bath stone]]. He also used an artificial stone and concrete in parts of the building.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\", (2006) 412-16</ref>  John Coates Carter was to go on to design the Paget Concert Rooms at [[Penarth]] in 1906 and the remarkable monastery complex on [[Caldey Abbey|Caldey Island]], Pembrokeshire. \n{{clear}}\n\n==William Burges==\n[[William Burges]]\u2019  contribution to Welsh architecture was notable but limited to three buildings, [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Castell Coch]] and [[Park House, Cardiff|Park House]], all three in Cardiff. His castles also had little influence on other architecture in Wales, with the possible exception of the Settlement Tower on [[Lake Vyrnwy]] with its conical roof.  The reason for this would appear to be that Burges started working in his distinctive style for his patron John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, in 1865 and by this time the [[Gothic Revival]] style of architecture was already starting to fall out of fashion. The influence of Park House was much more significant; [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]] considers the house \"revolutionized Cardiff's domestic architecture\"<ref>\"Newman\", (2001), 219.</ref> and the [[Cadw]] [[Listed building|Grade I listed building status]] given to the house records it as \"the pattern for much housing in Cardiff in later C19.

[[Mordaunt Crook]] remarks that Burges\u2019\u2018drew on his extensive travels and the studies he had made of the [[Campanile|campanilii]] of San Gimaggnano, Florence and Siena. He included recollections of Nuremberg and Palermo, of the Chateau de Chillonon on Lake Geneva, the Castello at Milan and the [[Palais des Papes]] at [[Avignon]]. Nearer home he took elements from [[Conwy|Conway]], [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] Castles.<ref>\"Crook\", 29</ref> The main influence on his work does appear to be [[French Gothic architecture]], particularly as interpreted by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet le Duc]]. Curiously an earlier Welsh example, of 1840 of this style, at Plas Rhianfa in Anglesey has been noted above, but there is no reason to think that Burges or his patron were influenced by this.\n\n===Cardiff Castle===\n{{main article|Cardiff Castle}}\n[[File:Cardiff Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Cardiff Castle]]\n[[File:Cardiff Castle clock tower.jpg|thumb|Cardiff Castle clock tower]]\nThe Marquis of Bute first met William Burges in 1865 and this was the start of a momentous partnership that was to last for sixteen years, and Cardiff Castle was to be transformed into a Neo- Gothic dream palace. Work on the castle started in 1869 with Bute's workmen pulled down the houses built against the South Curtain Wall. Burges restored the stonework, and he added a covered parapet walk with embrasures and arrow slits. The Clock Tower was built on the site of a Roman bastion and completed in 1875. The scheme included the Medieval buildings of the West wing which had been \u2018\u2018gothicised\u2019\u2019 by [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] in 1774. \nIn 1872 Lord Bute married the Hon. Gwendolen FitzAlan Howard. The couple had four children, and Burges designed a Nursery especially for them. Work continued with the rebuilding of the Bute Tower and Herbert Towers, as well as the new Guest and Tank Towers. The 15th-century Octagon Tower was restored with the addition of a timber fleche or spire above the battlements. Burges created a Library and the Banqueting Hall within the late medieval residential block. When Burges died in 1881, his work was continued by his former assistant [[William Frame]]. Frame built the Animal Wall and was responsible for restoring the newly discovered Roman remains.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cardiff Castle gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle.jpg|Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle\nFile:Cardiff Castle - Bankettsaal Kamin 1.jpg|Cardiff Castle Banqueting Hall\nFile:Cardiff Castle - Bankettsaal 2.jpg|Cardiff Castle Banqueting Hall\nFile:BanquetingHallCeiling.jpeg|BanquetingHallCeiling\nFile:Library, Cardiff Castle.jpg|Library, Cardiff Castle\n</gallery>\n\n===Castell Coch===\n{{main article|Castell Coch}}\n[[File:Castle Coch From Morganstown.jpg|thumb|left|Castle Coch From Morganstown]]\n[[File:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|thumb|Castell Coch \u2013 exterior]]\nCastell Coch, a ruined Medieval castle, lying to north of Cardiff, was intended as an occasional summer residence for the Marquess of Bute.\nBurges's reported on the proposed reconstruction of [[Castell Coch]] in 1872 but construction was delayed until 1875, partly because of the pressure of work at Cardiff Castle. The exterior comprises three towers, \"almost equal to each other in diameter, but arrestingly dissimilar in height .\"The Keep tower, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lie within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's bedroom comprise a suite of rooms that exemplify the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style in 19th-century Britain. A superb fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the Three Fates, spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The octagonal chamber with its great rib-vault, modelled on one designed by Viollet-Le-Duc at Councy, is \"spangled with butterflies and birds of sunny plume in gilded trellis work.\" Off the hall, lies the Windlass Room, in which Burges delighted in assembling the fully functioning apparatus for the drawbridge,<ref>\"Newman\", (1995), pg 314, {{ISBN|978-0-14-071056-4}}</ref> \n \nThe Marquess's bedroom provides some \"spartan\" respite before Lady Bute's Bedroom. The room is \"pure Burges: an arcaded circle, punched through by window embrasures, and topped by a trefoil-sectioned dome.\" The decorative theme is 'love', symbolised by \"monkeys, pomegranates, nesting birds\". The decoration was completed long after Burges's death 1881, but he was the guiding spirit; \"Would Mr Burges have done it?\" William Frame wrote to Thomas Nicholls in 1887.\nFollowing Burges' death in 1881, work on the interior continued for another ten years. The castle was not used much: the Marquess never came after its completion, and the family appeared to use it as a sort of sanatorium, although the Marchioness and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, did occupy it for a period following the death of the Marquess in 1900. But the castle remained \"one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition,\" summing up \"to perfection the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript.\"\n\n==== Castell Coch gallery ====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Castell Coch Room 2 (2995082296).jpg|Castell Coch Room 2\nFile:Three Fates chimneypiece, drawing room of Castell Coch.jpg|Three Fates chimneypiece, drawing room of Castell Coch\nFile:Castell Coch - Banqueting Room.JPG|Castell Coch - Banqueting Room\nFile:Castell Coch Hall Ceiling (2994216349).jpg|Castell Coch Hall Ceiling\n</gallery>\n\n=== Park House, Cardiff ===\n{{main article|Park House, Cardiff}}\n[[File:Park House, Park Place, Cardiff.JPG|thumb|Park House, Park Place, Cardiff]]\nPark House was built between 1871 and 1875 for James McConnochie, the dock engineer to Bute Estate.

The original hunting lodge was constructed in a Neo-Norman style by an unknown architect in the 1820s. This was extended by [[Thomas Henry Wyatt|T. H. Wyatt]] between 1837 and 1841. Then, from 1870 to the mid-1880s, Wyatt and his clerk of works, Henry Pope added a great Hall, an entrance court and a massive dining-room wing in Neo-Tudor style. Finally in 1895\u20131896 one of the leading architects of the period, [[Aston Webb]], added the [[Arts and Crafts]] Neo-Tudor Library Wing. This created a house with a corridor from the front door to the library of no less than 75 metres. The interior was furnished with much genuine Tudor and Jacobean woodwork, which had been collected from local houses.<ref>\"Newman\"(2000), 247\u2013256</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Arts and crafts==\n[[File:Bryniargo House, Rhayader 01.JPG|thumb|Bryniargo House, Rhayader 1893]]\n[[File:The Robert Owen Museum, Newtown.jpg|thumb|left|Free Library, Newtown (now the Robert Owen Museum), Frank Shayler, 1902]]\n[[File:Chepstow - The Lodge on Mount Way - geograph.org.uk - 527043.jpg|thumb|Chepstow \u2013 The Lodge on Mount Way]]\n[[Arts and Crafts architecture]] can be seen as an extension of the Tudorbethan Style in Wales. It is seen as starting c. 1887 under the influence of William Morris and was introduced into Wales by architects such as [[William Eden Nesfield]] who was responsible for the rebuilding of [[Kinmel Hall]] and the designer W.A.S Benson who was the architect for Clochfaen at [[Llangurig]] in Montgomeryshire. These architects very much favoured the use of [[half-timbered]] decoration, red brickworks, roof tiles and tile hanging on walls. A notable architect in this tradition was [[Frank Shayler]] who had set up offices in [[Oswestry]] and [[Shrewsbury]] and developed an extensive practice particularly in Montgomeryshire. Shayler, together with other architects in his practice were patronised by Lord Davies of Llandinam and were responsible for a series of Institute buildings as well as restoring a number of half timbered buildings such as the Mermaid in Welshpool and [[Owain Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House, Machynlleth|Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House]] in Machynlleth. In Radnorshire the architect [[Stephen W. Williams]] also worked in this style and built the Offices in [[Rhayader]] for the supervision of the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs|Elan Valley Reservoir]] project.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\" (2013), 409, fig</ref> A good example of this style providing domestic housing is the Lodge at [[Chepstow]], built between 1902 and 1908 by an unknown architect. Newman describes this as ''a witty, if rather belated essay in [[Norman Shaw]] style'' with stone, tile hanging and half-timbered gables.<ref>\"Newman\" (2000), 187</ref>\n\n===Later arts and crafts===\nThe Arts and Crafts movement progressed in Wales very much under the influence of [[Charles Voysey (architect)|C F Voysey]], and [[Edwin Lutyens]], who were throwing off the influence of both the [[Gothic Revival]] and the half-timbered Tudor revival styles which had been so prevalent in Wales. Voysey had worked in partnership with [[John Pollard Seddon|J.P. Seddon]] with offices in Cardiff, but, as yet no examples of his work have been recognised. Then in 1903 \u2013 6 he comes back to Wales to design the little known Ty Bronna on St Fagans Road, Cardiff.<ref>\"Newman\" (1995), 289\u201390 &pl.</ref> This is a minor masterpiece with its clean white outline, faced in stone, gabled at each end with a hipped roof and the angled battered buttresses from ground level to the eaves.

The style is also called ''Wrenaissance'', acknowledging a debt to [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. In Wales the style starts appearing in the 1890s and was used for major public architecture, the newly founded universities and commercial buildings. It reflected the considerable wealth generated in this period, particularly from coal mining and also the growth of Welsh National Identity. The first buildings in the newly planned [[Cathays Park]] in Cardiff, described as ''the finest civic centre in the British Isles''<ref name=\"Newman, 2000, pg.220\">\"Newman\", (2000), pg.220</ref> were the [[City Hall, Cardiff|Cardiff Town Hall, later City Hall]]  and the Law Courts, based on plans drawn up in 1897 and built between 1901 and 1905 to designs by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester|Lanchester, Stewart and Rickards]]. Newman sums up the buildings as ''swaggering Baroque  .. setting a new standard setting a new standard for the emergence of the Edwardian grand style for public buildings in Great Britain.  No Victorian architect had hitherto demonstrated such mastery of Continental Baroque, in this case the Baroque of South Germany and Austria, combined with the Neo-Baroque of Charles Garniers' [[Paris Opera]].''<ref name=\"Newman, 2000, pg.220\"/> The setting is given opulence by the use of Portland Stone for the facades. The [[National Museum of Wales]] was added to this grouping in the modified American Neo-Barogue or Beaux-Arts style by the London architects Smith and Brewer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utaaa/00046/aaa-00046.html|title=Smith and Brewer: An Inventory of their Drawings,1896\u20131939, bulk 1900\u20131919|author=|date=|work=utexas.edu|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> and later extended by the Welsh architects [[Thomas Alwyn Lloyd|T.

A refined example of this style was used by [[Alfred Cross]] for the Edward Davies Building at [[Aberystwyth University]], was the first purpose-built chemical laboratory in a British university. It was opened in 1907 by Lord Asquith and remained a functioning Chemistry Department until 1988.

While at first he established himself as a London-based architect he was to establish himself as major figure in the development of Welsh architecture in the first half of the 20th century, working in a variety of styles and designing buildings ranging from Country houses to workers housing.<ref>For an overview of Clough Williams-Ellis see \"Haslam\", (1996)</ref> One of his earliest designs of 1905 was for a pair of Welsh labourers cottages in a vernacular style with end gable chimneys which imitate the 16th-century ''Snowdonia Houses''<ref name=\"Haslam, 1996, 24, pl 1\">\"Haslam\", (1996), 24, pl 1.</ref> In 1909 he was to design a house in an advanced Arts and Crafts style for Cyril Joynson at Brecfa in Breconshire<ref name=\"Haslam, 1996, 24, pl 1\"/> In 1913\u20131914 he was to be resonsilble for the rebuilding of Llangoed Hall in Breconshire, one of the very last country houses to be built before the First World War. While it is a mixture of a number of historic styles, it was a modern features with elements such as the chimneys derived from the work of [[Lutyens]]<ref>\"Scourfield\"</ref> Other work in Wales by Clough Williams-Ellis includes the Festiniog Memorial Hospital of 1922, Pentrefelin Village Hall, the Conway Fall Cafe. At Aberdaron he designed the Old Post Office in a vernacular style in 1950.<ref>Haslam et al.\" (2009), 228</ref>  An important later commission was the redesign and rebuilding of [[Nantclwyd Hall]] in [[Denbighshire]]\nClough Williams- Ellis was equally capable in working in the Modernist idiom of the interwar years. This is well demonstrated by the recently restored Caffi Moranedd\nat [[Cricieth]] and the now demolished Snowdon Summit Station of 1934, which was demolished in 2007.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\" (2009), 394\u20135.</ref>\nHowever, his more memorable creation in Wales is the [[capriccio (painting)|capriccio]] town of [[Portmeirion]] on the coast of the [[Llyn]] near to [[Portmadoc]]. This is notable not only as an architectural composition, but also because Clough Williams- Ellis was able to preserve fragments from other now demolished buildings from Wales and Cheshire.

It has been suggested that the devastation caused following Owain Glynd\u0175r's revolt may have caused the destruction of many earlier timber-framed houses in the [[Welsh Marches]]<ref>\"Suggett & Stevenson\", (2010), 34</ref>\n\n===Tower houses and first floor halls===\n''see also'': [[Welsh Tower houses]]\n[[File:The Old Rectory, Angle.jpeg|thumb|The Old Rectory, Angle]]\n[[File:Tower , near Mold 1846.jpeg|thumb|left|Tower, near Mold 1846]]\nThe distribution of tower houses in Wales has been discussed by both Hilling and Smith. Welsh tower houses, most of them built between the early 14th and 15th centuries, were rectangular structures, consisting of two or more storeys, and are closely related to those in Ireland and Scotland.  In 1976 Hilling produced a map (with listing) showing 17 examples.<ref>Hilling J ''Historic Architecture of Wales: An Introduction.'' (1976), Univ. Wales Press, Cardiff, pp. 95\u20136</ref> Further houses have been added by Suggett and it is possible that new examples will be recognised as being incorporated into existing buildings, as at Sandyhaven House in Pembrokeshire.<ref>\"Suggett\", 2010, p. 29</ref>\n\nA further example is likely to be the prominent East Gate tower of [[Powis Castle]]. The East Gate appears to have been a tower house, which had an entrance made through the vaulted undercroft, probably in the 17th century. An extra storey was added to the tower in 1815\u20131818 when [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]] re-fenestrated the castle and added [[Gothic Revival]] battlements.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", (2013), 244</ref> Also on the Welsh border, close to [[Welshpool]] is [[Wattlesborough Castle|Wattlesburgh]].  Many of the English tower houses, such as [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall]] Castle or [[Buckden Towers|Buckden Palace]] are slightly later and larger than the Welsh examples, and built of brick.\n\nApart from tower houses there are a number of stone-built first floor hall buildings, where the hall is mounted over an [[undercroft]]. These include [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s Parliament House in Machynlleth. Most examples are found in southern Wales with a cluster of buildings in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The distribution of Tower and other houses in Wales with vaulted ceilings have been mapped and listed by Peter Smith.<ref>\"Smith P.(1988), 372\u20135, Map 7</ref>\n\nThey also occur as early merchant's houses in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] and [[Tenby]]. In some cases the hall is accessed by an outer stair, as is the case at Pentre Ifan Barn at [[Nevern]] in Pembrokeshire.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2013) 311</ref> Another example is Eastington at [[Rhoscrowther]], Pembrokeshire,  which has been called a tower house, but is more correctly a first floor hall house, with an outside stair and [[crenulation]]s with a side tower.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2013) 374, fig.</ref> Eastington belonged to the [[John Perrot|Perrot family]] in the 15th century. There is a further complex of [[Medieval]] stone houses at East Orchard, [[St Athan]], in Glamorgan which belonged to the [[Coity Castle|de Berkerolles]] family in the 14th century.  The group of buildings includes a first floor hall house with outside chimney, which also had a separate kitchen block.<ref>\"Newman\" (1995), 548, with reconstruction drawing go the buildings</ref>\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px>\nWattlesborough Tower, Shropshire.png|Wattlesborough Tower, Shropshire\nDavid Cox (II) - Powys Castle, Wales.jpg|David Cox (II).

Some of these such as [[Chirk Castle]] and [[Powis Castle]] have remained as houses, but others such as [[Raglan Castle]] in Monmouthshire and [[Carew Castle]] in Pembrokeshire are ruins which can provide some idea of their grandeur. At Carew [[Sir Rhys ap Thomas]] from about 1480 onwards undertook a grand re-modelling including an almost entire [[Fenestration (architecture)|re-fenestration]] with straight headed windows. This was continued after 1558 by [[Sir John Perrot]], who replaced the north range with a splendid frontage with a long gallery at the second floor level in the fashion of [[Robert Smythson]].<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\"(2004), 152\u20134.</ref>\n\nAn even more impressive residence on palatial scale was [[Raglan Castle]]. The earliest building is the freestanding hexagonal great tower, which is surrounded by a moat. It was probably built by [[William ap Thomas|Sir William ap Thomas]] before 1445. It would have served the function of a strongly defended tower house. This was followed in 1461\u20131469 by the enlargement of the castle by Sir William Herbert with a gatehouse to the NE and to the SW a range of sumptuously decorated state apartments. Further apartment ranges were built round the SW court. The two sets of apartments were approached by an impressive main staircase. From about 1549 to 1559 these buildings were extended, by [[William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester]],  particularly around the ''Pitched Stone'' Court and also with the long-gallery with its elaborately decorated [[Renaissance]] fireplaces. The slighting of the castle in the [[English Civil War]] and its subsequent partial demolition make it hard to appreciate Raglan as one of the major domestic buildings of Wales.<ref>\"Newman\"(2000) 489\u2013509.</ref> \n[[File:Tretower Court - geograph.org.uk - 562361.jpg|thumb|Tretower Court]]\n[[File:Tretower Court - geograph.org.uk - 550255.jpg|thumb|left|Tretower Court]]\nAnother early house connected with the Herbert family was [[Tretower Court]] in [[Breconshire]]. It was here that [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1469)|William Herbert]] settled his step brother Roger Vaughan who built a house, which was to develop round a courtyard and continued being added to until the 17th century. Recently the arched braced truss roof of the great hall has been dated by [[Dendrochronology]] to c. 1455.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\" (2013), 582\u2013589</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Houses associated with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].===\n[[File:Parliament House, Machynlleth.jpeg|thumb|left|Parliament House, Machynlleth in 1816]]\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr's parliament - geograph.org.uk - 379309.jpg|thumb|Owain Glynd\u0175r's parliament house]]\nThere are a number of houses in north Wales that have been traditionally associated with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] and there is also the Parliament House of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] at Ruthin. They may not be certainly associated with these historic figures, but they are important as evidence for early stone buildings in Wales. Best known is [[Owain Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House, Machynlleth|Glynd\u0175r's Parliament house in Machynlleth]]. This building has been substantially altered in more recent times, but fortunately Edward Pugh published a fine coloured lithograph of the building in 1816.<ref>Edward Pugh (1816), ''Cambria Depicta'', pg. 222</ref>  Recent dendrochronological dating of the felling of a roof timber to 1470, does not necessarily mean that the stone structure of the building in not associated with Glynd\u0175r.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1909 |title =Full Record - Machynlleth, The Parliament House|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref> The original building is a hall house with a four-unit plan: storeyed outer room of two bays, open passage (2 bays between partition trusses), open hall (three bays with dais-end partition),  and a storeyed inner-room of two bays. The carpentry is refined: [[purlins]] and ridge are tenoned into the [[trusses]]. The principal rafters of each truss are unusually shaped ('extruded') to receive the [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned collar]]. In the hall the purlins are moulded with two tiers of [[wind brace]]s (replaced), and the trusses have shaped feet. The upper-end truss is set forward from the [[dais]] partition to form a shallow canopy.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\". (2013), pg195</ref>\n[[File:Owen Glyndwr's Prison.png|thumb|Owen Glynd\u0175r's Prison, Carrog in 1794.]]\nAt [[Carrog]] near [[Corwen]] parts of Owain's ''Prison'' stood, possibly into the 20th century.  Thomas Pennant wrote in about 1776 that \"The prison where Owen confined his captives was not far from his house, in the parish of Llansantfraid Glyndwrdwy and the place is to this day called 'Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy'. Some remains are still to be seen near the church, which form part of a habitable house. It consists of a room 13 feet square and ten and a half high. The sides consist of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches asunder, mortised into them. In these are groves in the bottom, as if there had been cross bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly strong, composed of strong planks almost contiguous. It seems as if there had been two stories; but the upper part at present is evidently modern\".<ref>Pennant T, (1784) ''Tour in Wales''. Bridge Books reprint, Wrexham, 1990, Vol 1, 387\u20138</ref>  In 1794 John Ingleby was employed to make a watercolour record of the building, which stood just to the SE of the church and overlooked the River Dee. The building which was thatched and has some timber [[Close Studding|close studding]] and also a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arched window and Gothic arched doors.  There seems to be evidence for an outer stair leading to a first floor hall, which suggests that parts of the building could well have been contemporary with Owain Glynd\u0175r. The site of the building was on the modern Glynd\u0175r Terrace.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.carrog-station.moonfruit.com/download/i/mark_dl/u/4011868537/4592815337/Carrog%20trail.pdf|title = The Carrog Village Trail|publisher = www.carrog-station.moonfruit.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Owen Gledwr's Parliament House.png|thumb|left|Owen Glyndwr's Parliament House]]\n[[File:Houses next to Owen Gledwr's Parliament House.png|thumb|Houses next to Owen Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House, Dolgellau.]] \nThere was another Parliament House of Glynd\u0175r in the centre of [[Dolgellau]]. It was moved in 1885 to [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and re-erected in a much altered form. It may have been first referred to as the Parliament House in 1555.<ref>\"Gwylliad Cochion Mawddwy\".

The [[Medieval Welsh literature|Welsh Poets]] often provide good descriptions of these early houses from the 14th century onwards, when praising their patrons.  This is the case of [[Iolo Goch]]'s description of [[Owain Glyndwr]]'s house at [[Sycharth]] in the late 14th century, when the poet mentioned that the house was constructed with [[cruck]]s and had a slate roof.<ref>Johnston Dafydd, (1993), ''Iolo Goch: The Poems'', Gomer Welsh Classics Series, Llandysul,</ref>\nThe earliest timber framed houses are hall houses, which were single storied houses the main room of which was heated by a fire on an open hearth with the smoke escaping through a vent in the roof. In peasant houses the hall would have only consisted of a single bay. These smaller houses are rarely recognised now and where they exist the single bay is likely to form part of the structure of a larger house with more recent additions.\n\n===Dendrochronology and the dating of Welsh houses===\nSince the 1990s the availability of dates provided by tree-ring dating or [[dendrochronology]] has revolutionised the study of early buildings in Wales and is particularly relevant for timber framed buildings. The earliest tree ring date associated with a building in Wales is a date commissioned by [[CADW]] for a door at [[Chepstow Castle]] which was made from wood felled between 1159 and 1189.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1052 |title =Full Record - Chepstow, Chepstow Castle|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref>\n[[File:Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire 34.JPG|thumb|left|Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire, the door dated to 1159-1189AD]] A complete listing of tree ring dates for Wales is maintained by the Vernacular Architecture Group<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vag.org.uk/index.htm|title = Vernacular Architecture Group}}</ref> at the Archaeological Dataservice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/|title=Dendrochronology Database|author=|date= |work= archaeologydataservice.ac.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>  and slightly over 200 samples have been taken, though not all have provided positive results. The scheme has largely been sponsored by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] in conjunction with the Dating Welsh Houses Group (DOWG).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.datingoldwelshhouses.co.uk |title=Home|author=|date=|work=datingoldwelshhouses.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> The greatest number of dates are available from [[Merionethshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]] and [[Denbighshire]], areas which have some of the greatest concentrations of timber framed houses. Other early dates are c. 1250 for timbers from the Chapter House at [[Brecon Cathedral]] and 1386 for the bell frame in Tower of [[St David's Cathedral]]. The earliest domestic building to be dated by dendrochronology is Hafodygarreg at [[Erwood]], in [[Breconshire]] of 1402.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=1901|title =  Full Record - Crucadarn, Erwood, Hafodygarreg|website=Dendrochronology Database|publisher= Archaeology Data Service }}</ref> Many dates have been obtained for buildings after this, possibly suggesting that there was a great re-building in Wales after the devastation caused by [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]'s uprising. The evidence of dendrochronology clearly shows that in the 15th. and first half of the 16th. centuries [[Hall house]]s were the standard plan for domestic buildings. The great majority of [[timber-framed]] houses were built with [[cruck]] trusses, while a few higher status houses were constructed with aisled-trusses. Change came in the mid-16th century when houses became two or more storeyed. Regional forms of house evolve and some are now stone built. The earliest stone built ''Snowdonia Houses'', with an upper storey, is Tyn Llan at [[Gwyddelwern]], which has been shown by dendrochronology to date from 1519 to 1537.<ref>\"Suggett R & Dunn M\", (2015), 22</ref> The timber framed [[Glas Hirfryn]], on the Montgomeryshire/Denbighshire border, a house with a jettied upper storey and lateral chimney stack, is dated to c.1559. The precision of dendrochronological dating is very useful as it is often possible to suggest, with a considerable degree of certainty, for whom the house was built.  At Glas Hirfryn this would have been Morus ap Dafydd and at [[Great Cefnyberen]], built between 1545 and 1566, it would have been John ap Rhys. As the [[Will and testament|wills]] and [[Probate|probate inventories]] may well still exist, it is often possible to establish the status of the builder and how the house was furnished.\n\n==Aisled hall houses==\n[[File:Plas Uchaf, Corwen.png|thumb|left|Plas Uchaf, Corwen. Aisled hall]]\n\nAisled-framed [[hall house]]s have one or more rows of interior posts. These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. Aisled\nHall houses are early in the sequence of timber framed houses and were high status dwellings . In his study of these houses Peter Smith recorded 20 examples of this construction, mainly in NE Wales and particularly in [[Denbighshire]].<ref>Smith P (2001) \"Ty Mawr and the Aisle-Truss Houses of Wales'' in \"Britnell W\" (Ed), 201-18</ref> In some cases such as [[Plas Uchaf]] at [[Llangar]], which has now been restored by the [[Landmark Trust]] the roof was supported by both [[aisle]] and [[cruck]] trusses. Plas Cadogan at [[Esclusham]] near Wrexham survived as the finest example of a Welsh aisled house with an open hall up to roof. Despite being a Grade I listed building it was demolished in 1967.<ref>\"Hubbard\",(1985), pg. 165</ref> The roof has now been re-erected at the [[Avoncroft Museum]] at Bromsgrove.\n[[File:Althrey Hall, Bangor on Dee 1794.png|thumb|Althrey Hall, Bangor on Dee. Watercolour by John Ingleby 1794]] Aisled hall houses in Wales have been dated by dendrochronology to the 15th century, though examples in England are often earlier. Some of the aisled houses such as the Upper House at [[Painscastle]] in Radnorshire or Althrey Hall in [[Maelor Saesneg]] had box-framed wings added to provide far greater accommodation and formed an '''H''' shaped plan for the building. Althrey Hall was built in the early C16 and was described by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] as ''a fair house'' in the 1530s. It is thought that it was built for Richard ap Howel. The double portrait wallpainting surviving in the first floor of mid-16th-century date is likely to represent Richard's son, Elis ap Richard (died 1558), with his bride Jane Hanmer.<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1986), 321.</ref>\n[[File:T\u0177 Mawr, Castle Caereinion - geograph.org.uk - 1571886.jpg|thumb|left|T\u0177 Mawr, Castle Caereinion]]  An example of an aisled hall house that has been studied in great detail and fully restored is [[Ty Mawr, Castle Caereinion]] in Montgomeryshire.

Some of the cruck framed houses were extended by adding wings, providing an '''H''' shaped layout. With the introduction of [[Timber framing|box framed]] and [[jettied]] houses in the mid-15th century, the use of crucks gradually went out of fashion. At this time many cruck houses were converted into barns and evidence for fireplaces and chimney stacks stripped. A good example of a house that has been converted into a barn, possibly as late as the 18th century is at [[Ty Coch Cruck Barn, Llangynhafal, Denbighshire|Ty-coch]] [[Llangynhafal]], Denbighshire. This has recently been restored by Denbighshire County Council and it has been dated to 1430.<ref>Miles, D, Worthington, M & Bridge, M , 2006 , List 181: Welsh Dendrochronology Project \u2013 Phase 10, ''Vernacular Architecture'' Vol. 37.</ref> There are many instances in [[Montgomeryshire]] where more elaborate timber framed farmhouses are associated on the same site with earlier houses which were converted into barns.

''Medieval Houses''. Part II. ''Sub Medieval Houses'', c. 1550\u20131610. Part III. ''Renaissance Houses''. c. 1590\u20131714 , National Museum of Wales.</ref> Fox and Raglan recognised that around 1550 a great change occurred in Welsh House building. While the earlier Medieval traditions of constructing with [[cruck]]s and [[timber framing]] continued, many new features start to appear in domestic architecture. Chimneys start to be inserted into the halls of houses instead of the open fireplaces and chimney stacks may either be built on the gable ends of houses or as ''lateral chimneys'' on the side walls. At the same time timber framed and stone houses start to be built with one and even more [[storeys]]. [[Timber framing|Box framing]] starts to supplant the older timber framing with crucks and in order to gain more floor space at the upper levels these floors were [[jettied]] out from the building line. Fox and Raglan considered that in Monmouthshire, the building of ''Sub-Medieval''  houses continued until around 1620.<ref>Fox and Raglan's dating of these houses needs to be refined in the light of more recent [[dendrochronological]] dating</ref> In the later part of the 16th century, sub-medieval houses continued to be built in parallel with often grander houses showing [[Renaissance]] style or influences.\n[[File:Llancaiach Fawr.jpg|thumb|Llancaiach Fawr]]\nAn excellent example of a ''Sub Medieval'' house is [[Llancaiach Fawr|Llancaeach-Fawr]] at [[Gelligaer]] in Glamorgan. [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]] comments that in contrast with other buildings of the period ''it is a delight to find one so nearly perfectly preserved''. It is of three storeys and largely of a single build period. It was built by either Richard ap Lewis or his son David ap Richard (Prichard), who was resident here in the 1530s. The windows emphasise the importance of the first floor rooms.<ref>\"Newman\"(1995), 353\u2013356, with plans</ref>\n\nThe ideas of Fox and Raglan were developed by [[Peter Smith (architectural historian)|Peter Smith]] in his study of ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', first published in 1975 and re-issued as an enlarged addition in 1988. Smith classifies five main types of ''Sub-Medieval'' house based on the position of the chimney or chimneys and the position of the main entrance door.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 157\u2013221</ref> These groups are:\n* Type A, Houses with Lateral Chimney heating the hall of the house or end gable houses. These occur in northern and southern areas of Wales but rarely in the central areas.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 28</ref> The end gable houses include the ''Snowdonia'' houses of north Wales\n* Type B. Houses with the chimney backing on the entry. The chimneys are placed centrally in the house and the entrance may lead into a screens passage at the back of the fireplace.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 29 a&b</ref>\n* Type C. The ''Lobby Entrance House'' where the fireplace is centrally placed and the entrance is by a door into a small lobby area placed against the chimney stack. Those houses are timber framed and occur mainly in Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Denbighshire. The ''Severn Valley'' houses of Montgomeryshire are within this grouping.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 30</ref>\n* Type D. Similar to the ''Lobby Entry Houses'' but lack the double-backed fireplaces and have an additional end gable. There are a few houses of this type in N.E. Wales, but otherwise they occur as stone built houses in Glamorgan.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), Map 30, pg. 163</ref> \n* Type H. This is a gable entry house, similar to type B, but the entry is away from the gable fireplace. This type only occurs in [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire]].<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 163\u20134</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Long houses and the long house controversy===\n{{See also|Dartmoor longhouse}}\n[[File:Cilewent farmhouse, St Fagans.jpg|thumb|left|Cilewent farmhouse, St Fagans]]\n[[File:Hendre'r Ywydd Uchaf farmhouse, St Fagans.jpg|thumb|Hendre'r Ywydd Uchaf farmhouse, St Fagans]]\nA good example of a long house is Cilewent Farmhouse from Llansanffraid Cwmteuddwr, nr [[Rhayader]], [[Radnorshire]] which has been reconstructed at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]]. This is a ''long-house'', with cattle being accommodated at one end and humans at the other, with a passageway between the two parts. This type of farmhouse was once common in mid- and south Wales. This cruck and timber-framed house was originally built about 1470 as an open [[hall house]]. The original timber walls were rebuilt in stone in 1734, with the date being carved on the head of the entrance door frame. All that remains of the original house are the two cruck trusses in the cow house and the timber-framed partition between the cow house and the dwelling.  Another re-construction at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]] is Hendre'r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse from [[Llangynhafal]] in Denbighshire. This a cruck-framed hall-house [[Dendrochronology |dendrochronologically]] dated to 1508 and typical of the better class of Welsh farmhouse in the late Middle Ages. The building is divided into five bays, the lower two used for housing for cattle and horses, the centre bay serving as a work-room and the upper two comprising the open hall and a bedroom. The outside walls are timber-framed, the panels being in-filled with wattle and daubed with clay. Both the daubed panels and the timber work are limewashed as was common in the Middle Ages. The open hearth is placed in the centre of the hall, smoke from the fire escaping through the roof and the unglazed windows.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 47\u201349</ref>  Excavations in 2003 by Bill Britnell at T\u0177 Draw at [[Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr]] in north Powys have done much to elucidate the relationship of the cow house with the hall of a longhouse.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britnell |first1=W.

It has an open hall of two bays set between inner and outer rooms, the outer room acting as an cow [[byre]]. Dendrochrononology on the roof [[purlins]] suggest that T\u0177 Draw was completed shortly after 1479/80<ref name = britnell177>{{harvnb|Britnell|Silvester|Suggett|William|2008|p=177}}</ref> and it has been possible to suggest from this dating that the house was built by Hywel ap Rees.<ref name = britnell177/> In the byre area, which was accessed by door,  a series of small post holes were noted, that have been interpreted as wickerwork hurdles. These would have provided stalls for cattle which were overwintered from November to March each year. Similar evidence for stalls for cattle have been found at [[Ty Mawr, Castle Caereinion|T\u0177 Mawr]] and Tyddyn Llwydion in [[Montgomeryshire]].<ref>\"Britnell W. J. et al.\", (2008), 171\u20133</ref>\n\nThe idea of the \"Longhouse'' or ''T\u0177-hir'' was first discussed by [[Iorwerth Peate]] in his pioneering book \"The Welsh House''(1940). This was the description of a house where both people and beasts were housed together under the same roof, as portrayed in the Medieval Welsh poem the [[Dream of Rhonabwy]]. Peate thought that the Welsh Longhouse had had a long history and that it occurred in all parts of Wales. This view was challenged by Peter Smith, who had gathered a vast amount of information in his ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', published in 1975. This showed that longhouses were rarely ''one-phase'' buildings and often the byre had been added onto the house. This showed that longhouses were not an upland phenomenon and are noticeably absent from [[Gwynedd]] where ''Snowdonia Houses'' are detached from their farm buildings. The longhouses occur particularly in Ceredigion, Radnorshire and North Powys. Suggett uses the example of Nannerth-ganol near [[Rhayader]] to illustrate the close connection of with the family who lived in this house with [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]], which was particularly prevalent in mid-Wales in the [[Elizabethan]] period.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 83\u201392</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Box framing===\n[[File:Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin 01.JPG|thumb|Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin]]\n[[File:Abernodwydd Farmhouse.jpg|thumb|left|Abernodwydd Montgomeryshire, Farmhouse reconstructed at St Fagans]]\n[[File:St Fagans National History Museum 42.JPG|thumb|left|Abernodwydd Window. St Fagans]]\n\nBox framing is a simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof.  The term box frame is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing other than [[cruck]] framing. The distinction presented here is the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. The timber framework, when exposed will be visible as squares or rectangles panels.  and the houses will also show signs of bracing, particularly at the corners. Many of the Welsh houses have decorative features in the panels, such as [[quatrefoils]] and lozenge or herringbone deceptive woodwork. The panels may also be filled by [[Close studding]].  Box framing was used for the wings of earlier cruck or aisled timber framed houses, but it was not until the mid-16th that it was used as the main construction form for free standing houses in the ''Sub-Medieval tradition'', such as [[Glas Hirfryn|Glas Hirfryn, Llansilin]].\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, box framed houses grew larger and more elaborate.  They would now be built to three or four storeys with tall gabled projecting wings and decorative porches. \n[[File:Plas yn Pentre - geograph.org.uk - 587050.jpg|thumb|Plas yn Pentre near Trevor, Wrexham]]\n[[File:Lymore, Montgomery 01.png|thumb|left|Lymore, Montgomery]]\n[[File:Aberbechan Hall 1796 02.png|thumb|Aberbechan Hall in 1796]]\nA good example of this is Plas yn Pentre at [[Trevor]] near Wrexham. On the dissolution of the abbey in 1536 it came into the possession of the High Sheriff of Denbighshire, Ieuan Edwards. His grandson partially re-built the house in 1634. His initials and the date can be seen carved into the exterior of the west gable.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 291\u20132</ref> Many of these large timber box framed houses have disappeared, but watercolours and prints record [[Aberbechan Hall]] and [[Garthmyl Hall, Berriew]] in [[Montgomeryshire]] and Bychton in Flintshire. \n[[File:Maes Mawr Hall2.jpg|thumb|left|Maes Mawr Hall]] The largest and most impressive of these houses was [[Lymore, Montgomery]], built by Edward, third Lord Herbert of Chirbury, c. 1675 (date on a gable finial but not finished until 1677, a year before Lord Herbert's death) The house had a [[close-studded]] frontage, with an open three-bay [[Renaissance]] [[loggia]] on the ground floor, six gables (later reduced to three), and, rising from the centre, a pyramid-roofed look-out tower or [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]]. While the main house was built in timber, there was extensive use of brick for the inner courtyard and service wings. The hall was not used as the family seat for long, and for most of its existence it was either unoccupied or used by agents of the estate. It was, however, kept in good order and in 1909 the Prince of Wales, who was shooting in the surrounding parkland, was entertained here. In August 1921 the floor collapsed during a Bazaar Sale, and the hall was finally demolished in the 1931.<ref>Lloyd, T.,(1986) The Lost houses of Wales, p. 41.</ref> The Welsh gentry continued to build timber framed houses well into the 17th century, and distinctively these houses, such as [[Maesmawr Hall|Maes Mawr]]  in Montgomeryshire, have very wide entry porches. Box-framed timber houses for the working class continued to be built in mid-Wales into the early part of the 19th century. These later houses and cottages are constructed of very much lighter timber work or [[scantling]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pembrokeshire houses with round chimney stacks===\n[[File:Old Farmhouse at Pwllcaerog, Pembrokeshire.png|thumb|Old Farmhouse at Pwllcaerog, Pembrokeshire]]\n[[File:Rhosson Uchaf Farm, on the lane to St Justinian's, West of St David's - Tyddewi - geograph.org.uk - 886153.jpg|thumb|left|Rhosson Uchaf Farm, on the lane to St Justinian's, West of St David's]]\nThese form an unusual group of ''Sub-Medieval'' Houses which were studied by [[Edward Barnwell|E.L Barnwell]] in 1867\u20131868<ref>Romilly Allen J. (1902) ''Old Farm-Houses near St Davids with round chimneys Archaeologia Cambrensis 6th ser. vol ii</ref> and by   [[J Romilly Allen]] in 1902.<ref>Barnwell E. L.

Typically these chimneys have a lean to outshoot on either side of the stack with one of these outshoots acting as a porch. Cottages and houses with these chimneys were mapped by Peter Smith and he showed that they form two groups, one around St Davids and the other to the south of Pembroke. There is a good example of one of these chimneys on the [[Tudor Merchant's House|Merchants House, Tenby]]. Houses with very similar plans and lateral outshoot, but with square chimneys, also cluster on the [[Gower Peninsular]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Lobby entrance and Severn Valley houses===\n[[File:Penarth, a black and white house near Newtown (geograph 2980737).jpg|thumb|Penarth, a black and white house near Newtown (geograph 2980737)]]\n[[File:Talgarth front.jpg|thumb|left|Talgarth front]]\nThe timber-framed lobby entrance house emerged in the mid-16th century in Mid Wales. The majority of these houses occur in [[Montgomeryshire]] with outliers in [[Radnorshire]] and [[Denbighshire]]. The chimney in these houses is generally in the middle of the house. There is no cross passage, unlike the Longhouses and the ''Snowdonia'' houses and instead the main doorway opens into a small lobby on the side of the fireplace. The chimney generally stands between the kitchen and the [[parlour]], and the key feature of these houses is the emphasis placed on the parlour which takes the place of a hall.<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 114</ref>  Many of these houses are earlier [[cruck]] framed hall houses, and some are box framed, which have had chimney's inserted and interior floors. An example of this one the best known of the lobby entrance houses is [[Penarth (Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn)]], which stands prominently by the road between [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]] and [[Welshpool]]. This originally appears to have had a cruck framing. It has had two cross wings added and is strikingly decorated with [[close studded]] and herringbone timber work decoration.\n[[File:Trewern Hall 1.jpeg|thumb|Trewern Hall]] \nA development of this is ''Severn Valley Houses'' which particularly congregate along the [[Severn]] Valley in [[Montgomeryshire]] especially between [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Welshpool]].<ref>\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 109\u2013132</ref> A typical feature of the Severn Valley houses are the elaborate entry porches to the houses which often have decorative scroll brackets supporting a jettied upper story. These porches often are added features to an earlier timber framed house and lead directly into a lobby entrance. A well known example of the Severn Valley type, which has added timber framed wings to the house is [[Trewern Hall]] near Welshpool. A house which has been dated by dendrochronology is Lower Cil on the outskirts of [[Berriew]]. This is a well-preserved farmhouse. Its left side is 16th-century (the square framing under the render was felled in 1583), probably a hall-house enlarged when the close-studded taller right end was rebuilt in the early 17th century to provide a new parlour and porch, both slightly jettied. The porch has open sides with turned rails, and the original inner door. The remodelling included the typical Severn Valley lobby-entry central chimney, with its triple-moulded brick stacks.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/vag_dendro/full_record.cfm?id=2394|title = Full Record - Berriew, Lower Cil (or Keel)|website = Dendrochronology Database|publisher = Archaeology Data Service}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Snowdonia houses===\n[[File:Ty Mawr Wybrnant.JPG|thumb|Ty Mawr Wybrnant]]\n[[File:Amgueddfa Werin Cymru.jpg|thumb|left|Snowdonia Farmhouse- Y Garreg Fawr from Waunfawr, Gwynedd at St Fagans]]\nSnowdonia houses have recently been the subject of considerable study by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] and the Dating Old Welsh Houses Group.<ref>\"Suggett and Dunn\" (2014)</ref> These houses are typical of the ''Sub Medieval'' houses appearing in Wales in the earlier part the 16th century, which are a development from the [[Hall house|Hall House]]. Characteristically Snowdonia Houses are now built on a vertical rather than horizontal plan with two or more storeys and lateral chimney stacks set against the end gables. The older cruck construction is now replaced with roofs constructed of trusses and [[purlins]] supported on stone walls. The centrally placed doorway may now be set under a massive stone ''cyclopean'' arch as at [[Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan]] or else under a fan arch of stone slabs as at Y Garreg Fawr. Y Garreg Fawr from [[Waenfawr]] in Caernarfonshire has been re-constructed at [[St Fagans National History Museum|St Fagans]] and has been dated to 1544<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/buildings/garregfawr/|title=Garreg Fawr Farmhouse|author=|date=|work=museumwales.ac.uk|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\nThe earliest example of a Snowdonia House dated by [[dendrochronology]]  is Dugoed at [[Penmachno]].

A much altered ''post and panel'' screens passage with three entrances,<ref>\"Smith\" Map 37, 491</ref> now in the hall area of the main house, is likely to have been removed from the hall in the older house.

In Glamorgan an early example of Renaissance alteration was made to the facade of the outer gatehouse of the now ruined [[Old Beaupre Castle|Old Beaupre]], near [[Cowbridge]] in 1580. This was followed by the more striking Porch in the inner courtyard of 1600 at Old Beaupre.<ref>[[RCAMW]], (1981), ''Glamorgan: The Greater Houses'' HMSO, 46\u201363, pls1-3. {{ISBN|0117007544}}</ref>\nA later and more developed example of Renaissance architecture is [[Ruperra Castle]], built in 1628 for the Welsh soldier [[Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Morgan]]  and the design ideas may originate from his travels on the Continent. The castle is rectangular in layout with round towers at the corners. A feature of Ruperra is the rectangular three light windows with drip moulds, with the centre light higher than the side lights.<ref>[[RCAMW]], (1981), 262\u20138</ref> These windows appear on other Welsh Renaissance houses. The Castle is rectangular with round corner towers and a Porch with a classical doorway. As the result of a fire in 1941 it now stands partly ruined. In the north-east of Wales a very important surviving Renaissance house was [[Plas Teg]] near [[Mold]]. Rectangular in form with rectangular corner towers it is the typical form of Renaissance house seen over much of Europe. A close parallel would be the first phase (unfinished) of [[Drumlanrig Castle]] in Scotland. Another important Renaissance house, demolished in 1973, was Brymbo Hall near [[Wrexham]]. The house was built for John Griffith in 1625 and a Baroque wing was added later in that century. The core of the house was in brick with a fine classical doorway.

Clough had lived in Antwerp, and upon his return to Denbighshire in 1567 he built  ''Bach-y-graig'' and ''Plas Clough''. Bach-y-Graig appears to have served as a lodge-cum-office, with large associated warehouse ranges set around a courtyard, the while the more traditional Plas Clough was clearly intended from the outset as his main house.

The Welsh families who built them often were less interested in the outside display of architectural features and more interested in the interior decoration, particularly elaborate plasterwork, painted walls and elaborately carved woodwork with armorials commemorating their family descent. Many of these houses such as [[Bodysgallen Hall|Bodysgallen]], which was started in 1620 and [[Mostyn Hall]] are an amalgamation of different styles of architecture over many years.  The front is of 1631\u20131632.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 400\u20131.</ref> In the case of [[Nercwys]] Hall near Mold it is known that the contractor who built the Hall was Raffe Booth of Chester and the plans for the house were drawn up by his carpenter Evan Jones.

The most notable examples of these which are set in the countryside are Corsygedol in Merionethshire, Cefnamwlch near Tudweiliog and Rhiwaedog near Bala.  The impressive example at Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire is now only known from earlier drawings and the gatehouse at Madryn on the Llyn survives, but not the house.\n\n[[Plas Mawr]] in [[Conwy|Conway]] is one of the most impressive surviving courtyard houses of this period, which has recently been restored by [[CADW]]. An [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] townhouse, dating from the 16th century. The property was built by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]], a member of the local gentry, following his marriage to his first wife, Dorothy Griffith. Plas Mawr occupied a plot of land off Conwy's High Street and was constructed in three phases between 1576 and 1585 at a total cost of around \u00a3800.<ref name=\"Turner 1995 195\">{{harvnb|Turner|1995|p=195}}</ref>\nThere three phases of house construction \u2013 1576\u201377, 1580 and 1585 \u2013 were probably [[Project management|overseen]] by several different senior craftsmen, possibly working to an original plan determined by a surveyor or mason working at the English royal court.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1988|p=229}}</ref> Judging by the details of the roof design, a single master carpenter may have been used for all three parts of the build.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2008|p=13}}</ref>\nOther buildings, such as stables formed part of the courtyard.  The courtyard layout of these houses in north Wales may be compared with similar houses of the Elizabethan Period in England, particularly brick built houses in East Anglia, such as [[Erwarton|Erwarton Hall]] in Suffolk.

South wing interior. Lloyd Armorials of 1597 over fireplace.]]\nGreat attention was paid to the interior decoration of the Great Houses. Extensive use was made of decorative plasterwork and the restoration of the plasterwork which has been painted to show the original colour at [[Plas Mawr]] in Conway gives some idea as to how this would have appeared. Where expensive wallhangings or tapestries could not be afforded, extensive painted imitations would be used. Wooded panelling and armourial carving still survive in some houses, often over fireplaces. A carved panelled room has been returned to [[Gwydir Castle]] and a carved over-mantle at [[Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan|Faenol Fawr]] records the building of the house in 1597 and the armourials of the Lloyd family.

Brick makers tended to be itinerant until the mid-19th century, digging clay and firing bricks took place close to the building that was to be constructed.<ref>A detailed account of this is given for the building of Caersws Workhouse between 1837 and 40. Mont Colls</ref> One of the more permanent brickyards was the Herbert's (Earls of Chirbury) brickyard at Stalloe near Montgomery, which would have been the likely source for the impressive ''New Build'' at [[Montgomery Castle]] and for large quantities of bricks used in building of the service wings at [[Lymore, Montgomery|Lymore near Montgomery]]  1664\u201367 and also for 17th-century brick-faced town houses in [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]] and possibly Welshpool. The earliest use of brick in the 16th century was for the construction of massive chimney stacks of ''Stellar'' form with multiple flues within timber-framed houses. These stacks would have greatly reduced the risk of fire, and the study by Peter Smith of the distribution of these stacks show them to be clustered along the Welsh border from Montgomeryshire northwards.<ref>\"Smith\"(1988), 470\u20132</ref>\nWhile brick making may have started by Flemish brick makers working for Sir Richard Clough, building in brick was also becoming established in Shropshire<ref>Moran M.(2003), ''Vernacular Buildings of Shropshire''Logaston Press,</ref> and in Cheshire.  The earliest of the typical Elizabethan Houses using brick with stone dressing was Trevalyn Hall built for John Trevor in 1576<ref>Hubbard\"1975, 287\u20139</ref>   Brick with stone dressing was used for the construction of Brynkinalt at [[Chirk]], near to the Welsh border with England.

Modern commercial development has tended to remove most of the timber framed houses from the high streets of Welsh towns, leaving the occasional examples, often public houses such as the \u2018\u2018Buck\u2019\u2019 in Newtown and the thatched ''Horse and Jockey'' in [[Wrexham]]. Many more examples of timber framed houses exist behind brick facades of the 18th and 19th centuries. This is particularly the case in the small market town of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], where the [[Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Herbert family]] encouraged the inhabitants to rebuild the houses with brick frontages from the 1670s onward.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", (2013), 206\u2013218</ref>\nIn most instances timber framed houses in towns are smaller versions of the timber framed houses of the countryside, but adapted to fit onto the more restricted [[burgage]] plots.

Early market halls were placed in the market area with an open area below for the market traders and an upper area that was used as a court room and council chamber. In the major County towns these buildings would also have been the meeting place of the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]] which as well as holding the [[Assizes]] supervised the county administration, and these halls were often known as the [[Shire]] Hall.

The original design of the Town Hall shows the ground floor market space was open with five bay arcades. The upper floor housed the Council Chamber and Court of Great Sessions and Quarter Sessions. In 1828 [[Thomas Penson]], at the expense of Lord Clive, raised the roof level over the first floor and introduced sash-windows, rebuilding the pedimented gable, but without the coat of Arms.  An extension was added at the rear with rounded quadrant corners and was tied in by extending the string courses around the building, adding a matching [[pediment]] to that at the front. The arcade arches were infilled with glazing and bricks in 1887, and the attractive clock tower was added in 1921.\n[[File:9 The Market Hall HTsmall.jpg|thumb|Market Hall at Monmouth 1837-9]]\n[[File:Guildhall Square, Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|left|The Guildhall, Carmarthen 1767\u201377]]\nAn important building, although altered,  in [[Palladian]] style is [[Sir Robert Taylor]]'s Guildhall at Carmarthen, built between 1767 and 1777.

The first bridge was washed away and the second bridge collapsed, but his third bridge was a single arch bridge of 140 feet, then the largest of the type in the world, which he completed in 1756, which is still standing, now known as the [[Old Bridge, Pontypridd|Old Bridge]]. In order to reduce the weight of the bridge he pierced large cylindrical holes through the haunches of the bridge, which solved a constructional problem and gives it its elegant appearance.<ref>Colvin H.

Nash left London in 1784 to live in [[Carmarthen]], where his mother had retired to, her family being from the area. He set up with Samuel Simon Saxon, another London architect,<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 852.</ref> to work as building contractors and suppliers of building materials. Nash's London buildings had been standard Georgian terrace houses, but it was in Wales that he matured as an architect. His first major work was Carmarthen Prison  (1789\u20131792). The prison was planned by the penal reformer [[John Howard]] and Nash developed this into the finished building. He went on to design the prisons at Cardigan (1791\u20131796) and Hereford (1792\u20131796). In 1789 St David's Cathedral was suffering from structural problems, the west front was leaning forward by one foot, Nash was called in to survey the structure and develop a plan to save the building. His solution completed in 1791,  was to demolish the upper part of the facade and rebuild it with two large but inelegant flying buttresses.\nIn 1790 Nash met [[Uvedale Price]], of Downtown Castle, whose theories of the [[Picturesque]] would influence Nash's town planning. Price commissioned Nash to design Castle House Aberystwyth (1795). Its plan took the form of a right-angled triangle, with an octagonal tower at each corner, sited on the very edge of the sea.<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 687\u2013689</ref>\n[[File:Llanacheron.JPG|thumb|left|Llanerchaeron]]\nOne of Nash's most important developments was a series of medium-sized country houses that he designed in Wales; these developed the villa designs of his teacher Sir Robert Taylor. Most of these villas consist of a roughly square plan with a small entrance hall with a staircase offset in the middle to one side, around which are placed the main rooms, there is then a less prominent servants' quarters in a wing attached to one side of the villa. The buildings are usually only two floors in height, the elevations of the main block are usually symmetrical. One of the finest of these villas is [[Llanerchaeron]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} and at least a dozen villas were designed throughout south Wales.\n[[File:Whitson Court, Whitson, Newport, Monmouthshire c.1890.jpg|thumb|left|Whitson Court, Whitson, Newport, Monmouthshire c. 1890]] \nOthers, in Pembrokeshire, include Ffynone, built for the Colby family at Boncath near Manordeifi, and Foley House, built for the lawyer Richard Foley (brother of Admiral Sir Thomas Foley) at Goat Street in Haverfordwest.<ref>Michael Mansbridge (1991),  ''John Nash: A complete Catalogue 1752\u20131835'' Rizzoli/Phaidon, pp 44\u201345</ref>  Villas of this type were widely imitated in Wales, particularly by [[Joseph Bromfield]] of Shrewsbury.\nAs Nash developed his architectural practice it became necessary to employ draughtsmen, the first in the early 1790s was [[Augustus Charles Pugin]], then a bit later in 1795 [[John Adey Repton]] son of [[Humphrey Repton]]. It was presumably through Nash that Repton gained commissions in Wales, such as [[Stanage Park]] in Radnorshire.\n[[File:Clytha Park, The Lodge at the main gate - geograph.org.uk - 1432545.jpg|thumb|Clytha Park, 1797]]\nIn 1796 Nash spent most of his time working in London; this was a prelude to his return to the capital in 1797. At this time Nash designed the delicate Strawberry Hill [[Gothic revival]] gateway to [[Clytha Park]] near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire,<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 41</ref>  and also his alterations in Gothic Revival style in 1794 to [[Hafod Uchtryd]] for Thomas Johnes at Devil's Bridge, Cardiganshire<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 48\u201349.</ref> Also in c. 1794\u201395 he advised on the paving, lighting and water supply in [[Abergavenny]] and designed an elegant market building.<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 49.</ref> Other work included Whitson Court near Newport. After his return to London, was to continue to design houses in Wales which were to include Harpton Court in Radnorshire, which, apart from the service wing was demolished in 1956.<ref name=\"Mansbridge, 1991, 122\">Mansbridge, (1991), 122.</ref> In 1807 he drew up plans for the re-building of [[Hawarden Castle (18th century)|Hawarden Castle]] with Gothic battlements and towers, but the plan appears to have been modified by another architect when it was carried out.<ref>Mansbridge, (1991), 135\u201336</ref> About 1808 he designed Monachty near [[Aberaeron]]. and later drew up plans for work at [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]].<ref name=\"Mansbridge, 1991, 122\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Prisons and workhouses===\n\n[[File:The Roundhouse, Ruabon - geograph.org.uk - 589787.jpg|thumb|left|The Roundhouse ([[village lock-up]]), Ruabon]] \nIn the latter part of the 18th century, as the result of [[Prison reform]] new prisons came to be built in most of the Welsh [[County town]]s. The reforms were the result of the work of [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], who in 1777 published  ''The State of the Prisons''<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}</ref>  He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. This was followed by the [[Penitentiary Act]] which was passed in 1779. This act was in implemented in each Welsh county by the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]] and which led to the building of many new prisons across Wales. These included the gaols built in Carmarthen and Cardigan by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and the gaols at [[Caernarfon]] (1793), [[Ruthin]] (1785) and [[Flint]](1775) by [[Joseph Turner (architect)|Joseph Turner]].<ref>\"Colvin\" (1995), 998</ref> Most of these prisons were closed in the 1870s, but the Ruthin gaol, now used as the Denbighshire County Record Office is remarkably well preserved. The Anglesey Gaol at [[Beaumaris]] came later in 1828\u20131829 by the architects [[Joseph Hansom|Hansom]] and [[Edward Welch|Welch]]. This incorporates many of the innovations of the [[Millbank Prison|Milbank Penitentiary]] in London of 1812\u20131821 with wings, a massive [[curtilage]] wall and a central glass [[cupola]] for the oversight of the prison complex.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\" (2009), 107\u20138</ref> \n[[File:Montgomery Gaol Gateway IMG 2598.JPG|thumb|Montgomery Gaol Gateway]]\nThis plan was developed for the Montgomeryshire County gaol at [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]] by the County Surveyor [[Thomas Penson]], c. 1830\u201332.

Wyatt had worked for [[Robert Adam]], the leading [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical architect]] when he became the clerk of Works at [[Kedleston Hall]] in 1759. Between 1776 and 1779 he remodelled Baron Hill at [[Beaumaris]] on Anglesey for Viscount Bulkely, while his brother became estate manager for the Pennants at [[Penrhyn Castle|Penrhyn]]. Colvin remarks that Wyatt specialised in the designing of medium-sized country houses in an elegant and restrained neo-classical manner. Characteristic features of his houses were [[astylar]] elevations with prominent bowed projections which were domed and were either single or in pairs. His windows were often tripartite and overarched.<ref>\"Colvin\",(1995), pp, 1124\u20138</ref> He rarely deviated from the neo-classical, though he did a gothic revival building at [[Penrhyn Castle]] which was replaced by Hopper's Neo-Romanesque Castle. At [[Kinmel Hall|Kinmel Park]] near St Asaph, around 1790, he built a stylish house for the Rev Edward Hughes, who derived great wealth from the development of the [[Parys Mountain|Parys Copper mines on Anglesey]]. This house had a bowed front and panels with classical swags, possibly of [[Coade stone]]. It was burnt down in 1841, but fortunately it was recorded in a watercolour by John Ingleby in 1794.<ref>\"Hubbard\" (1986), 280</ref> A further house in this style was the Old Bishop's Palace in [[St Asaph]] which was probably by Samuel Wyatt,<ref>\"Hubbard\", (1986), Pl.72</ref> while at Brynbella in [[Tremeirchion]] a London surveyor, Clement Mead built Brynbella, for [[Dr Johnson]]'s friend [[Mrs Thrale]].

Keck who worked from [[Kings Stanley]] Gloucestershire may have worked with [[Sir Robert Taylor]] who would have introduced him to clients in Wales.

Thomas Penson had trained under [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] in Chester, and his most notable building in the classical style was the Flannel Exchange in [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]] of 1832, which although still standing, was badly defaced by its conversion into a cinema in the early 20th century. The Shrewsbury architects, [[Joseph Bromfield]] and the Haycock family had been influenced by the talented [[Thomas Farnolls Pritchard|Farnolls Pritchard]], the original designer of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]]. While this group of architects worked in various styles, they particularly developed the classical style in Wales. [[Edward Haycock, Sr.|Edward Haycock]]'s most important works were [[Glynllifon]] near [[Caernarfon]], the facade to [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] stables and [[Clytha Park]] near [[Abergavenny]],  and the laying out of the small town of [[Aberaeron]] in [[Ceredigion]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Public buildings===\n[[File:Swansea Museum - geograph.org.uk - 1485806.jpg|thumb|left|Swansea Museum]]\n[[File:Caernarfon Crown Court.jpg|thumb|Caernarfon Shire Hall /Crown Court]]\n\nThe Greek revival style was chosen for many public buildings in Wales.

In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest To the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon.<ref>This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman\u2019s article in \u2018\u2018Archaeologia\u2019\u2019 (1837), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].</ref> The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837.  The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which was a mixed Gothic style.<ref>[[Mowl, Timothy]] (1991) ''Penrhyn and the Norman Revival\u2019\u2019 in \"National Trust Guide\", ''Penrhyn Castle, Gwynedd''. pp.89\u201390.</ref> The Welsh architect [[Thomas Penson]], however, built churches in this style in [[Montgomeryshire]]\n\n===Strawberry Hill and the earlier [[Gothic Revival]]===\n[[File:Garth, Guilsfield 03.png|thumb|left|Garth, Guilsfield]]\n[[File:Neale(1818) p5.280 - Gnoll Castle, Glamorganshire.jpg|thumb|Gnoll Castle, Glamorgan-Neale(1818) p5.280]]\n[[File:Bodelwyddan Castle 21.JPG|thumb|left|Bodelwyddan Castle Central Gothic extension 1802-8]]\n[[File:Plas Newydd.jpg|thumb|Plas Newydd]] \n[[File:Bodelwyddan Castle 34.JPG|thumb|left|Bodelwyddan Castle Gothic window alcove at Boddelwddan 1802-8]]\n[[File:Plas Newydd ( Anglesey ) - Eingangshalle 2 Decke.jpg|thumb|Plas Newydd ( Anglesey )-Plasterwork in Entrance Hall]]\nA surprisingly early example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] in Wales is the south wing of [[Hensol Castle]] in Glamorgan.  Hensol had three storied east and west wings added with tower-like semi-octagonal bays which were [[Window|fenestrated]] with pointed gothic windows and surmounted by battlements.<ref>RCAHMW, (1981), ''Glamorgan: The Greater Houses'', HMSO pg.339\u2013340.</ref> It has been suggested that this very early Gothic architecture was the work of [[Richard Morris (architect)|Richard Morris]]<ref>CADW, Listed Buildings Schedule, ref. 72/D/7(2)</ref> who also designed [[Clearwell Castle]]<ref>Rowan A (1970) ''Clearwell Castle, Gloucestershire'', in Colvin H and Harris J, ''The Country Seat: Studies in the History of the British Country House'', Allen Lane, London, pp. 145\u2013149.</ref>  in Gloucestershire about 1728.<ref>\"Colvin\", 3rd ed, pp 665\u2013669</ref> One of the towers at Hensol is dated 1735 and much of the evidence for this early phase at Hensol has been disguised by the later gothicisation of the building.\n\nAnother example of the simple Gothic revival style was Gnoll near Neath. This was a remodelling, starting in 1776, of an existing house for Sir Herbert Mackworth, owner of a local copper works. It had a crenulated parapet and round towers at the two corners of the frontage.  The architect was [[John Johnson (architect, born 1732)|John Johnson]] an Essex architect who had been associated with Mackworth's banking interests in London.\nFollowing this,  examples of [[Strawberry Hill, London|Strawberry Hill]] Gothic start appearing in Wales, the most significant of which was [[Hafod Uchtryd|Hafod]]. The first stage of Hafod was started 1786 by [[Thomas Baldwin (architect)|Thomas Baldwin of Bath]] for [[Thomas Johnes]], in a Gothic revival style with gothic window,  battlements and pinnacles and then in 1793\u20131794 [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] added a top-lit galleried library and a 300&nbsp;ft long conservatory.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006), 474\u20135. This phase of the building was destroyed by a fire in 1807</ref>\nAnother early pioneer of the Gothic style was [[James Wyatt]] who was employed by the Earl of Uxbridge to build [[Beaudesert (House)|Beaudesert]] in Staffordshire in the Gothic style in 1771\u20131772. The Earl was to employ him again at [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] on Anglesey to rebuild the West front and the interior in a Gothic style from 1793 to 1799<ref>\"Haslam R et al.\", (2009), 153</ref> Wyatt worked with the Lichfield architect James Potter and the style of plasterwork lacks the lightness of Strawberry Hill gothic. \nPlas Newydd was followed by the more remarkable Gothic mansion at [[Garth (Guilsfield)|Garth]] at [[Guilsfield]] in [[Montgomeryshire]], built for Devereux Mytton, probably in the late 1790s.<ref>This work should be post 1794, when the old house at Garth was recorded by John Ingleby in a watercolour, now in the National Library of Wales.</ref> \nAnother house with Strawberry Hill Gothic features was [[Bodelwyddan Castle]] which had a Gothic wing and gothic interior added between 1802 and 1808 by an unknown architect.  During this period a number of other houses in Wales were given Gothic facades with arched pointed windows, such as Llewenni in Denbighshire.<ref>\"Hubbard\",  249 and Howell P. (1977), 'Country Life', Vol 162, pg. 1966</ref> At [[Hawarden Castle (18th century)|Hawarden Castle]] the [[Palladian]]  house, on a different site to the medieval castle, was transformed by [[Thomas Cundy (senior)|Thomas Cundy]] in 1809\u20131810 for [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet|Sir Stephen Richard Glynne]].

Possibly the best example of this is [[Clytha Castle]] the work of architect and garden designer John Davenport.<ref>''Newman'' (2000)  192</ref> This style was a less archaeologically correct form of Gothic revival and was widely used in Wales during the period 1780 to about 1810. Greater emphasis was placed on prominent arrow slits in round towers, blanked [[quatrefoil]] windows and stepped and angled battlements on gables. The earliest example of this may be the re-building of [[Penrhyn Castle]], sometime before 1782 by [[Samuel Wyatt]] for Richard Pennant, who was to develop the [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] slate quarries. This building is only known from drawings by [[Moses Griffiths]], though parts of it were incorporated into [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]'s rebuilding of Penrhyn. While it shows the features of this evolving style, the doorway shows the influence of Strawberry Hill gothic.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\"(2009), 399</ref>\nFolly Gothic was a style which was widely adopted for park gates and lodges and for small houses sited in picturesque positions in locations frequented by tourists.\nA good example is Ogwen Bank near [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], built by Lord Penhryn, possibly to a design by Samuel Wyatt,  for visitors to the Ogwen falls.<ref>E Pugh, (1816), ''Cambria Depicta'', pg 104-5</ref> In the [[Montgomeryshire]]  at [[Berriew]] Bodheilin was built was built in a prominent position overlooking the valley of the river [[Severn]].

He purchased the [[National Botanic Garden of Wales|Middleton Hall]] estate about 1790 and built this tower 1808.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006), 239</ref> Designed by [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] who also worked for Paxton in the development of [[Tenby]]. The tower was built to commemorate Nelson's death at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. The tower is 36 feet high. The lower part of the tower is triangular in shape with a turret at each corner and on the first floor there is a banqueting room. On the second floor there is a hexagonal prospect room surrounded by roof terraces.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Castellated Gothic===\n[[File:Hensol Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Hensol Castle]]\nCastellated Gothic was a style that emerged in Wales following the Napoleonic Wars and has been little studied, although a considerable number of Country Houses were built in this style up to about 1870. It is largely derived from the earlier Castellated Gothic Mansions built Robert Adam in Scotland<ref>Rowan A. (1985) ed., Robert Adam  ''Designs for Castles and Country Villas''.</ref> and Adam was also the designer of one house built in Wales, [[Wenvoe Castle]] in Glamorgan in 1776/7 of which only one wing of the building now survives.<ref>\"Newman\"(1995), pg 645</ref> This ''Welsh'' style of Castellated Gothic lacks the historical precision of detailing seen in ''Strawberry Hill'' Gothic, but it has borrowed the turrets and battlements some Medieval Castles in Wales such as [[Raglan Castle|Raglan]] and the earlier [[Cardiff Castle]]. In some cases Medieval castles which were still inhabited were by re-built in this style. [[Powis Castle]] on the outskirts of [[Welshpool]] was extensively re-built with new windows and battlements in the castellatted gothic style by [[Sir Robert Smirke]] between 1815 and 1818.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", (2013), 244.</ref> while Ruthin Castle was rebuilt in this style firstly in 1826 and then more extensively between 1848 and 1853 by [[Henry Clutton]]. In many instances these Castellated Gothic houses, such as Llanerchyddol near Welshpool, have not been attributed with certainty to any architect, and are likely to have been the work of a local architect or one working in Shrewsbury. The main features of these houses are the prominent [[Machicolation|machicolated]]  towers and the horizontal, rather than vertical, architectural composition. Rough hewn stone rather than [[ashlar]] was often used and rectangular windows under ''Tudoresque'' drip moulds.[[File:Bodelwyddan castle view2 arp.jpg|thumb|left|Bodelwyddan Castle, Denbighshire]]\n[[File:Gatehouse to Brynkinalt - geograph.org.uk - 165751.jpg|thumb|Gatehouse to Brynkinalt by Joseph Bromfield]]\nInitially older houses such as [[Bodelwyddan Castle|Bodelwyddan]]  in Denbighshire or [[Hensol Castle]] had large extensions added to them. At Stanage Park in Radnorshire the design has been attributed to [[John Adey Repton]], but he employed as the building contractor [[John Hiram Haycock]]. Haycock, from Shrewsbury, was equally competent as an architect and may have contributed to appearance of the building. This has led Thomas Lloyd to suggest that the similar appearance of Glandyfi (c. 1812) in Ceredigion, may also be the work of Haycock.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\" (2006,471</ref>  At Brynkinalt in Denbighshire the addition of castellated towers and other feature (now removed) on a late 17th-century house was the work of another Shrewsbury architect [[Joseph Bromfield]].<ref>\"Colvin\"</ref> However, the Gothic entrance gate that can be attributed to Bromfield survives.\n[[File:Cyfartha Castle.jpg|thumb|Cyfartha Castle]]\nCastellated Gothic was the style employed by [[Robert Lugar]]  when he built [[Cyfarthfa Castle]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] for the iron master William Crawshay, in 1824\u20131825.

Further prints of Welsh castellated mansions were included in the Rev [[Francis Orpen Morris]]'s ''The County Seats of the Noblemen and Gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland''  which was published in six volumes of coloured lithographs in 1870; and also in the engravings in Thomas Nicholas' ''Annals and antiquities of the counties and county families of Wales; containing a record of all ranks of the gentry \u2026 with many ancient pedigrees and memorials of old and extinct families'' published in two volumes by [[Longmans]] in 1872.

Plas Rhianfa in [[Llandegfan]] near Beaumaris overlooks the [[Menai Strait |Menai Straights]]. The architect was Charles Verelst of Liverpool, who was also known as [[Charles Reed (architect) |Charles Reed]], but the building was inspired by [[Sarah Elizabeth Hay-Williams|Lady Sarah Hay Williams]] of [[Bodelwyddan Castle]], who commissioned the building for her two daughters. Lady Hay Williams, an artist, had sketched the Chateau of the Loire, and presumably greatly influenced the designs of her architect. (She may also have been influenced by [[Harry Longeville Jones]] who was living close to Beaumaris at the time and was a writer on French Gothic architecture.) The house is described as a forest of steep French roofs covered in fish tail slates, and a skyline fretted with curved and straight pitches and spires, which are level with the road at the back. On the seaward front narrow drum towers with conical roofs.<ref>\"Haslam et al.\"(2009, 150)</ref> Inside there are highly decorative fireplaces, similar to those in Bodelwyddan Castle, which can be seen as precursors to similar decorative work at Cardiff Castle by [[William Burges]].

The use of terracotta was largely limited to Great Houses in Eastern England.<ref>Wright J, (1972), Brick Building in England up to 1550, Baker, London, pp178-195.</ref> Then in the 1830s and 1840s a number of architects started sourcing terracotta from the brickyards that were associated with coal mines in the West Midlands.\n[[File:Garthmyl Hall 04.JPG|thumb|left|Garthmyl Hall with the Gold/Naylor Coat of Arms in terracotta set in the pediment]] One of the earliest architects to make use of this source was the Welsh architect [[Thomas Penson]], who worked from offices in Oswestry. There appears to be good evidence that he sourced his terracotta from the brickyards which were associated with the [[Oswestry]] coalfield at [[Morda]] and [[Trefonen]] on the Welsh border.<ref>\"Stratton\", (1993). pg. 51</ref> Penson used terracotta moulding for church architecture, most notably St Davids, Newtown and [[Christ Church, Welshpool]]. As yet no examples the use of the terracotta from these brickyards for domestic buildings is known, although the Trefonen brickyard, which was described as a terracotta works,   was later owned by the railway engineer [[Thomas Savin]] and may have been used for some of his projects. [[James Kellaway Colling]] used extensive terracotta decoration for [[Garthmyl Hall, Berriew]] in Berriew in Montgomeryshire. This was almost certainly sourced from [[John Marriott Blashfield|J M Blashfield]]'s terracotta works at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]. \n[[File:Brick building at Pen-y-bont - geograph.org.uk - 768572.jpg|thumb|left| Offices and Gatehouse to J C Edwards Terra cotta works at Pen-y-bont]]\n[[File:Pierhead Building Cardiff Bay 01.jpg|thumb|Pierhead Building Cardiff, detailing]]\nFrom about this time terracotta production with matching bricks started to be produced on a large scale in the [[Wrexham]] area in association with mines of the [[north Wales Coalfield]]. This was centred on [[Ruabon]] and many companies sprang up. The last of these to go out of business was J. C Dennis in 2010. However the most important and best known of these companies was J C Edwards, who about 1867 opened up the Pen-y-bont brickyard. This brickyard produced a distinctive rich red brick and terracotta ornamentation that can be readily recognised. This was recognised and used by some of the leading architects of the period, most notably [[Alfred Waterhouse]] who used it for the [[Prudential plc|Prudential Insurance Offices]] in both London and Birmingham. Examples of Ruabon terracotta can be seen on buildings, particularly banks and public institutions throughout England, but as might be expected, terracotta was particularly popular in Wales.  Most towns having several examples often including banks,  shops and sometimes houses.\n\n[[File:Wyvern Pierhead Building Cardiff Bay (2991221537).jpg|thumb|Wyvern decorative panel, Pierhead Building,  Cardiff]]\n[[File:Tower above the entrance to John Summers' Building - geograph.org.uk - 404711.jpg|thumb|left|Tower above the entrance to John Summers' Building 1907]]\nOne of the most iconic Terracotta buildings in Wales is the Pierhead building at Cardiff Docks, adjacent to the Welsh Assembly building.

Ruskin and Street advocated styles of architecture which used striking colour combinations and were modelled on Venetian and north Italian Gothic architecture. There is little evidence of Ruskinian Gothic in Wales, but with the notable exception of Cardigan Town Hall, but it did give rise to the use the use of [[Polychrome brickwork]]. Cardigan Town Hall was designed by [[Robert Jewell Withers]] and built in 1858-60.  \n[[File:Plas Castell.jpg|thumb|left|Plas Castell Gatehouse, Denbigh]]\n[[File:Terraced housing, Kerry - geograph.org.uk - 634432.jpg|thumb|Terraced housing, Kerry, Montgomeryshire]]\nThe use of patterned or polychrome brickwork, sometimes associated terracotta was popular in the towns in Montgomeryshire and North Eastern Wales in the 1870s and 1880s. A striking example is the Plas Castell Gatehouse at Denbigh, a Tudoresque [[Machicolation|machicolated]] tower with bars of yellow brick contrasting with the red bricks. The tower was built in 1882.  In [[Kerry, Powys|Kerry]], Montgomeryshire the estate architects [[J W Poundley and D Walker]] produced an unusual composition of a terrace of houses built for the [[Leighton Hall, Powys|Naylors]] next to the former Kerry workhouse. The red bricks are punctuated by a double string of white brick and a pattern of white and black bricks below the eaves and for the upper voussoirs. The use of curved bricks in the voussoirs give the impression of an Egyptian [[pharonic]] head-dress.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\", 126-7</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Italianate style architecture===\n[[File:Llandovery Town Hall 01.JPG|thumb|left|Llandovery Town Hall, by R K Penson, 1857-8]]\n[[File:Penoyre House, near Brecon - geograph.org.uk - 250800.jpg|thumb|Penoyre House, near Brecon]]\n[[File:Parc Howard museum - geograph.org.uk - 143410.jpg|thumb|Parc Howard museum 1882-6]]\nPrompted by Queen Victoria's [[Osbourne House]], the Italianate style of architecture became popular in the second half of the 19th century. Features of this stye include [[belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] towers and roofs with a shallow slope and wide eaves.  In Wales[[Richard Kyrke Penson|R. K Penson]] was a leading exponent of the style. Penson had an extensive practice in the south of Wales, particular in church building and restoration, but examples of his use of the Italianate style include the Town Hall at [[Llandovery]] and the gate lodge to [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]]. The style was popular for country houses in Carmarthenshire and include the now demolished Pant Glas at [[Llanfynydd]] and Gellideg at [[Llandyfaelog]].<ref>\"Lloyd\" (1989), 269</ref> Pant Glas was built in 1850 and Gellideg in 1852.

Seddon was a London architect who developed an extensive practice in south Wales. Initially he worked with John Prichard from 1853 to 1859 and then with [[John Coates Carter]], who had an office in Cardiff, until 1904.  Seddon was surveyor to Llandaff Cathedral and most of his work was church building and parsonages for the Llandaff Diocese.<ref>Antonia Brodie ed (2001)\u2018\u2019\u2019Directory of British Architects, 1834\u20131914\u2019\u2019\u2019: Vol. 2 (L-Z), 575-6, . British Architectural Library, Royal Institute of British Architects Continuum 2001.</ref> However he built some notable country houses such as Llanilar at Abermad in [[Ceredigion]] in 1870\u20131872<ref>\"Lloyd\" (2006), 530</ref> and most notably the Old College Building of Aberystwyth University. The Old College Building is on the seafront and replaced Castle House, which had been built for [[Uvedale Price]] by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] in 1791\u20131794. Castle House had been bought by the railway entrepreneur [[Thomas Savin]] in 1864 and he employed Seddon to rebuild it as a hotel. Following Savin's bankruptcy in 1866, it was purchased by the future university and until 1890 Seddon together with his partner John Coates Carter continued to rebuild and extend the building. [[The Builder]] described it as ''one of the most original and characteristic monuments of the [[Gothic Revival]]'', while Thomas Lloyd writes ''Seddon's originality lies in his very fluid use of curves and complex geometrical forms, and in the blurring of angles and joints, syncopation that has something of [[Art Nouveau]]''. Seddon mixes detail of [[Early English Period|Early English]] with Venetian and French late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic Architecture]]. The stone used comes from Cefn at [[Minera]], dressed with [[Bath stone]]. He also used an artificial stone and concrete in parts of the building.<ref>\"Lloyd et al.\", (2006) 412-16</ref>  John Coates Carter was to go on to design the Paget Concert Rooms at [[Penarth]] in 1906 and the remarkable monastery complex on [[Caldey Abbey|Caldey Island]], Pembrokeshire. \n{{clear}}\n\n==William Burges==\n[[William Burges]]\u2019  contribution to Welsh architecture was notable but limited to three buildings, [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Castell Coch]] and [[Park House, Cardiff|Park House]], all three in Cardiff. His castles also had little influence on other architecture in Wales, with the possible exception of the Settlement Tower on [[Lake Vyrnwy]] with its conical roof.  The reason for this would appear to be that Burges started working in his distinctive style for his patron John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, in 1865 and by this time the [[Gothic Revival]] style of architecture was already starting to fall out of fashion. The influence of Park House was much more significant; [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]] considers the house \"revolutionized Cardiff's domestic architecture\"<ref>\"Newman\", (2001), 219.</ref> and the [[Cadw]] [[Listed building|Grade I listed building status]] given to the house records it as \"the pattern for much housing in Cardiff in later C19.

[[Mordaunt Crook]] remarks that Burges\u2019\u2018drew on his extensive travels and the studies he had made of the [[Campanile|campanilii]] of San Gimaggnano, Florence and Siena. He included recollections of Nuremberg and Palermo, of the Chateau de Chillonon on Lake Geneva, the Castello at Milan and the [[Palais des Papes]] at [[Avignon]]. Nearer home he took elements from [[Conwy|Conway]], [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] Castles.<ref>\"Crook\", 29</ref> The main influence on his work does appear to be [[French Gothic architecture]], particularly as interpreted by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet le Duc]]. Curiously an earlier Welsh example, of 1840 of this style, at Plas Rhianfa in Anglesey has been noted above, but there is no reason to think that Burges or his patron were influenced by this.\n\n===Cardiff Castle===\n{{main article|Cardiff Castle}}\n[[File:Cardiff Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Cardiff Castle]]\n[[File:Cardiff Castle clock tower.jpg|thumb|Cardiff Castle clock tower]]\nThe Marquis of Bute first met William Burges in 1865 and this was the start of a momentous partnership that was to last for sixteen years, and Cardiff Castle was to be transformed into a Neo- Gothic dream palace. Work on the castle started in 1869 with Bute's workmen pulled down the houses built against the South Curtain Wall. Burges restored the stonework, and he added a covered parapet walk with embrasures and arrow slits. The Clock Tower was built on the site of a Roman bastion and completed in 1875. The scheme included the Medieval buildings of the West wing which had been \u2018\u2018gothicised\u2019\u2019 by [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] in 1774. \nIn 1872 Lord Bute married the Hon. Gwendolen FitzAlan Howard. The couple had four children, and Burges designed a Nursery especially for them. Work continued with the rebuilding of the Bute Tower and Herbert Towers, as well as the new Guest and Tank Towers. The 15th-century Octagon Tower was restored with the addition of a timber fleche or spire above the battlements. Burges created a Library and the Banqueting Hall within the late medieval residential block. When Burges died in 1881, his work was continued by his former assistant [[William Frame]]. Frame built the Animal Wall and was responsible for restoring the newly discovered Roman remains.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cardiff Castle gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle.jpg|Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle\nFile:Cardiff Castle - Bankettsaal Kamin 1.jpg|Cardiff Castle Banqueting Hall\nFile:Cardiff Castle - Bankettsaal 2.jpg|Cardiff Castle Banqueting Hall\nFile:BanquetingHallCeiling.jpeg|BanquetingHallCeiling\nFile:Library, Cardiff Castle.jpg|Library, Cardiff Castle\n</gallery>\n\n===Castell Coch===\n{{main article|Castell Coch}}\n[[File:Castle Coch From Morganstown.jpg|thumb|left|Castle Coch From Morganstown]]\n[[File:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|thumb|Castell Coch \u2013 exterior]]\nCastell Coch, a ruined Medieval castle, lying to north of Cardiff, was intended as an occasional summer residence for the Marquess of Bute.\nBurges's reported on the proposed reconstruction of [[Castell Coch]] in 1872 but construction was delayed until 1875, partly because of the pressure of work at Cardiff Castle. The exterior comprises three towers, \"almost equal to each other in diameter, but arrestingly dissimilar in height .\"The Keep tower, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lie within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's bedroom comprise a suite of rooms that exemplify the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style in 19th-century Britain. A superb fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the Three Fates, spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The octagonal chamber with its great rib-vault, modelled on one designed by Viollet-Le-Duc at Councy, is \"spangled with butterflies and birds of sunny plume in gilded trellis work.\" Off the hall, lies the Windlass Room, in which Burges delighted in assembling the fully functioning apparatus for the drawbridge,<ref>\"Newman\", (1995), pg 314, {{ISBN|978-0-14-071056-4}}</ref> \n \nThe Marquess's bedroom provides some \"spartan\" respite before Lady Bute's Bedroom. The room is \"pure Burges: an arcaded circle, punched through by window embrasures, and topped by a trefoil-sectioned dome.\" The decorative theme is 'love', symbolised by \"monkeys, pomegranates, nesting birds\". The decoration was completed long after Burges's death 1881, but he was the guiding spirit; \"Would Mr Burges have done it?\" William Frame wrote to Thomas Nicholls in 1887.\nFollowing Burges' death in 1881, work on the interior continued for another ten years. The castle was not used much: the Marquess never came after its completion, and the family appeared to use it as a sort of sanatorium, although the Marchioness and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, did occupy it for a period following the death of the Marquess in 1900. But the castle remained \"one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition,\" summing up \"to perfection the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript.\"\n\n==== Castell Coch gallery ====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Castell Coch Room 2 (2995082296).jpg|Castell Coch Room 2\nFile:Three Fates chimneypiece, drawing room of Castell Coch.jpg|Three Fates chimneypiece, drawing room of Castell Coch\nFile:Castell Coch - Banqueting Room.JPG|Castell Coch - Banqueting Room\nFile:Castell Coch Hall Ceiling (2994216349).jpg|Castell Coch Hall Ceiling\n</gallery>\n\n=== Park House, Cardiff ===\n{{main article|Park House, Cardiff}}\n[[File:Park House, Park Place, Cardiff.JPG|thumb|Park House, Park Place, Cardiff]]\nPark House was built between 1871 and 1875 for James McConnochie, the dock engineer to Bute Estate.

Finally in 1895\u20131896 one of the leading architects of the period, [[Aston Webb]], added the [[Arts and Crafts]] Neo-Tudor Library Wing.

It is seen as starting c. 1887 under the influence of William Morris and was introduced into Wales by architects such as [[William Eden Nesfield]] who was responsible for the rebuilding of [[Kinmel Hall]] and the designer W.A.S Benson who was the architect for Clochfaen at [[Llangurig]] in Montgomeryshire. These architects very much favoured the use of [[half-timbered]] decoration, red brickworks, roof tiles and tile hanging on walls. A notable architect in this tradition was [[Frank Shayler]] who had set up offices in [[Oswestry]] and [[Shrewsbury]] and developed an extensive practice particularly in Montgomeryshire. Shayler, together with other architects in his practice were patronised by Lord Davies of Llandinam and were responsible for a series of Institute buildings as well as restoring a number of half timbered buildings such as the Mermaid in Welshpool and [[Owain Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House, Machynlleth|Glynd\u0175r's Parliament House]] in Machynlleth. In Radnorshire the architect [[Stephen W. Williams]] also worked in this style and built the Offices in [[Rhayader]] for the supervision of the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs|Elan Valley Reservoir]] project.<ref>\"Scourfield and Haslam\" (2013), 409, fig</ref> A good example of this style providing domestic housing is the Lodge at [[Chepstow]], built between 1902 and 1908 by an unknown architect. Newman describes this as ''a witty, if rather belated essay in [[Norman Shaw]] style'' with stone, tile hanging and half-timbered gables.<ref>\"Newman\" (2000), 187</ref>\n\n===Later arts and crafts===\nThe Arts and Crafts movement progressed in Wales very much under the influence of [[Charles Voysey (architect)|C F Voysey]], and [[Edwin Lutyens]], who were throwing off the influence of both the [[Gothic Revival]] and the half-timbered Tudor revival styles which had been so prevalent in Wales. Voysey had worked in partnership with [[John Pollard Seddon|J.P. Seddon]] with offices in Cardiff, but, as yet no examples of his work have been recognised.

The style is also called ''Wrenaissance'', acknowledging a debt to [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. In Wales the style starts appearing in the 1890s and was used for major public architecture, the newly founded universities and commercial buildings. It reflected the considerable wealth generated in this period, particularly from coal mining and also the growth of Welsh National Identity. The first buildings in the newly planned [[Cathays Park]] in Cardiff, described as ''the finest civic centre in the British Isles''<ref name=\"Newman, 2000, pg.220\">\"Newman\", (2000), pg.220</ref> were the [[City Hall, Cardiff|Cardiff Town Hall, later City Hall]]  and the Law Courts, based on plans drawn up in 1897 and built between 1901 and 1905 to designs by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester|Lanchester, Stewart and Rickards]]. Newman sums up the buildings as ''swaggering Baroque  .. setting a new standard setting a new standard for the emergence of the Edwardian grand style for public buildings in Great Britain.  No Victorian architect had hitherto demonstrated such mastery of Continental Baroque, in this case the Baroque of South Germany and Austria, combined with the Neo-Baroque of Charles Garniers' [[Paris Opera]].''<ref name=\"Newman, 2000, pg.220\"/> The setting is given opulence by the use of Portland Stone for the facades.
