These empires were later replaced in the [[Iron Age]] by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian empires]]. Widely considered to be the [[cradle of civilization]], [[Mesopotamia]] brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing. \n\nThe art of Mesopotamia rivalled [[Art of Ancient Egypt|that of Ancient Egypt]] as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western [[Eurasia]] from the 4th millennium BC until the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that, with some exceptions,<ref>Frankfort, 124-126</ref>  painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted. [[Cylinder seal]]s have survived in large numbers, many including complex and detailed scenes despite their small size. \n\nMesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.<ref>Frankfort, Chapters 2\u20135</ref> Favourite subjects include deities, alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows,  single, fighting each other or a human, [[confronted animals]] by themselves or flanking a human or god in the [[Master of Animals]] motif, or a [[Tree of Life]].<ref>Convenient summaries of the typical motifs of cylinder seals in the main periods are found throughout in Teissier</ref>\n\nStone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374</ref> the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,<ref>Frankfort, 71\u201373</ref> and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and well preserved late one.<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374; 167</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nOne fundamental intention of Mesopotamian art was to honour the gods and goddesses who ruled over different aspects of nature and important life events. The central place of worship was the ''[[ziggurat]]'', a stepped pyramid with stairs leading to an altar where worshipers would elevate themselves closer to the heavens. Much like the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians believed that their rulers had a direct link to their gods, and many artworks depict rulers shown in a glorified manner.\n\nAs in other ancient civilizations, for the, sculptures, mostly rather small, are the main type of artwork to survive. In the late period [[Assyrian sculpture]] for palaces was often very large.  Most of the Sumerian and Akkadian statues of figures are in a position of prayer. The main types of stone used are [[limestone]] and [[alabaster]].\n\n==Prehistoric Mesopotamia==\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|Area of the [[Fertile Crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

After the [[invention of agriculture]], farmers worked in the valley, but the community lived in the more easily fortifiable hills. Unlike in [[Ancient China|China]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], the villages had two economic orientations, downhill to the fields of grain and uphill into the mountains of [[Anatolia]] with their rich mines of gold and copper.

Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin.

The period includes the [[Amorites]] [[Isin-Larsa|Isin-Larsa Period]] and the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] or Old Babylonian period (c.1830\u20131531 BC), an interlude under the rule of the [[Kassites]] (c. 1531\u20131155 BC) followed by invasions of the [[Elamite]], while the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392\u2013934 BC) developed in the northern part of Mesopotamia.

He is famous for his [[code of Hammurabi|law code]] and conquests, but he is also famous due to the large amount of records that exist from the period of his reign. During the period Babylon became a great city, which was often the seat of the dominant power. The period was not one of great artistic development, these invaders failing to bring new artistic impetus,<ref>Frankfort, 127</ref> and much religious art was rather self-consciously conservative, perhaps in a deliberate assertion of Sumerian values.<ref>Frankfort, 93</ref> The quality of execution is often lower than in preceding and later periods.<ref>Frankfort, 110-116, 126</ref> Some \"popular\" works of art displayed realism and mouvement, such as the [[:File:Four-faced god, Ishchali, Isin-Larsa to Old Babylonia periods, 2000-1600 BC, bronze - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - (detail).jpg|statuette of a walking four-headed god]] from [[Ishchali]], attributed to the period between 2000\u20131600 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roux |first1=Georges |title=Ancient Iraq |date=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=9780141938257 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC&pg=PT204 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Burney Relief]] is an unusual, elaborate, and relatively large (20\u00d715&nbsp;inches) [[terracotta]] plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions.

From around 879 BC the Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]], originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. \n\nHuman figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' scenes in alabaster, and the [[Lachish reliefs]] showing a war campaign in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], both of which are of the 7th century BC, from Nineveh and now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref> Reliefs were also carved [[rock relief|into rock faces]], as at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]], a style which the Persians continued.\n\nThe Assyrians produced relatively little sculpture in the round, with the partial exception of colossal human-headed ''[[lamassu]]'' guardian figures, with the bodies of lions or bulls, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and often also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor.  A [[Assyrian statue (BM 124963)|single statue of a nude female is known]].  The Assyrian form of the [[winged genie]], winged spirits with bearded human heads seen in reliefs, influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its \"[[orientalizing period]]\" added various winged mythological beasts including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[griffin]] and winged horses ([[Pegasus]]) and men ([[Talos]]).<ref>Frankfort, 205</ref>  Many carry the [[bucket and cone]].\n\nEven before dominating the region the Assyrians had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref>  At [[Nimrud]] the carved [[Nimrud ivories]] and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by [[Phoenicia]]n and Aramaean artisans.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHermitage Nimrud 5.jpg|Winged figure near a sacred tree; 9th century BC; from the palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] ([[Nimrud]], Iraq); [[Hermitage Museum]]\nOpenwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds MET DP110622.jpg|Openwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds; 9th\u20138th century BC; ivory; 12.7\u00d711.91\u00d71.09 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nBritishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg|Relief with two Assyrian cavalrymen charging against enemies; circa 728 BC; gypsum; height: 129 cm, width: 183; [[British Museum]] (London)\nCylinder seal and modern impression- scorpion-man, deities, one on winged lion MET DP-13006-001 (cropped).jpg|Cylinder seal and with deities, on of them being on a winged lion; 8th\u20137th century BC; quartz, crypto-crystalline; 4.09 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:A glazed terracotta tile from Nimrud, Iraq, depicting a court scene, currently housed in the British Museum, London.jpg|Glazed terracotta tile from [[Nimrud]], with a court scene, British Museum\nTransport cedar Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19890.jpg|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar; 713\u2013716 BC; height: 2.41 m, width: 38 cm; [[Louvre]]\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|Relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m\nLion-shaped weight-Sb 2718-P5280901-gradient (cropped).jpg|[[Assyrian lion weights|Lion weight]]; 6th-4th century BC; bronze; height: 29.5 cm, [[Louvre]]\nAncient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920) (14741970056).jpg|Assyrian ornaments and patterns, illustrated in a book from 1920\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian period (626\u2013539 BC)===\n[[Image:Ishtar gate in Pergamon museum in Berlin..jpg|thumb|The [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] of the Ishtar Gate in the [[Pergamon Museum]] ([[Berlin]])]]\n\nThe famous [[Ishtar Gate]], part of which is now reconstructed in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], was the main entrance into [[Babylon]], built in about 575 BC by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], who exiled the Jews; the empire lasted from 626 BC to 539 BC.  The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours.  Lions, dragons and bulls are represented.  The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums.<ref>Frankfort, 203\u2013205</ref>  Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened and decorated with large horizontal metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived, such as the various [[Balawat Gates]].\n\nOther traditional types of art continued to be produced, and the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage.  Many sophisticated and finely carved seals survive.  After Mesopotamia fell to the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with [[Ancient Greek art]], the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged,<ref>Frankfort, 348-349</ref> and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the [[Hellenistic art]] that succeeded the conquest of the region by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nSeal Hero fighting two winged deamons-MBA Lyon E306-IMG 0086.jpg|Seal with a modern impression in which is depicted a hero fighting two female winged deamons; 8th\u20137th century BC; [[chalcedony]]; [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (France)\nConical seal MET vsz1999 325 097.jpg|Conical seal; 7th\u20136th century BC; lapis lazuli; height: 2.7 cm, diameter: 2.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPassing lion Babylon AO21118.jpg|Brick panel of a passing lion, from the ''[[Gate of Ishtar]]''; 605\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta; from Iraq; [[Louvre]]\nFile:20131205 Istanbul 056 (cropped).jpg|One of the [[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]] dragons from the ''Gate of Ishtar''; 604\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta, now [[Istanbul]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Jewellery==\n[[File:Necklace MET an33.35.47.jpg|thumb|Necklace; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and [[lapis lazuli]]; length: 22.5 cm; [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]], Iraq]]\nThe preferred jewellery designs used in [[Mesopotamia]] were natural and geometric motifs such as leaves, cones, spirals, and bunches of grapes.

A number of documents have been found that relate to the trade and production of jewellery from Sumerian sites. \n\nLater Mesopotamian jewellers and craftsmen employed metalworking techniques such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], granulation, and [[filigree]]. The large variety and size of necklaces, bracelets, anklets, pendants, and pins found may be due to the fact that jewellery was worn by both men and women, and perhaps even children.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nEarring MET DP104223.jpg|Pair of earrings; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nNecklace beads MET DP104225.jpg|Necklace beads; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 54 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEarrings from Shulgi.JPG|Pair or earrings with cuneiform inscriptions, 2093\u20132046 BC; gold; [[Sulaymaniyah Museum]] ([[Sulaymaniyah]], Iraq)\nReconstructed sumerian headgear necklaces british museum.JPG|Sumerian necklaces and headgear discovered in the royal (and individual) graves of the Royal Cemetery at Ur, showing the way they may have been worn, in [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n==Collections==\n{{main|List of museums of ancient Near Eastern art}}\n[[File:Room 300-IMG 7644.JPG|thumb|350px|A room with Mesopotamian art, from the [[Louvre]]]] \nBy some margin, the most important collections are those of (in no particular order) the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum]] (Berlin, Germany), the [[British Museum]] (London), the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City), and the [[National Museum of Iraq]] (Baghdad).

The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that, with some exceptions,<ref>Frankfort, 124-126</ref>  painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted. [[Cylinder seal]]s have survived in large numbers, many including complex and detailed scenes despite their small size. \n\nMesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.<ref>Frankfort, Chapters 2\u20135</ref> Favourite subjects include deities, alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows,  single, fighting each other or a human, [[confronted animals]] by themselves or flanking a human or god in the [[Master of Animals]] motif, or a [[Tree of Life]].<ref>Convenient summaries of the typical motifs of cylinder seals in the main periods are found throughout in Teissier</ref>\n\nStone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374</ref> the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,<ref>Frankfort, 71\u201373</ref> and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and well preserved late one.<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374; 167</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nOne fundamental intention of Mesopotamian art was to honour the gods and goddesses who ruled over different aspects of nature and important life events. The central place of worship was the ''[[ziggurat]]'', a stepped pyramid with stairs leading to an altar where worshipers would elevate themselves closer to the heavens. Much like the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians believed that their rulers had a direct link to their gods, and many artworks depict rulers shown in a glorified manner.\n\nAs in other ancient civilizations, for the, sculptures, mostly rather small, are the main type of artwork to survive. In the late period [[Assyrian sculpture]] for palaces was often very large.  Most of the Sumerian and Akkadian statues of figures are in a position of prayer. The main types of stone used are [[limestone]] and [[alabaster]].\n\n==Prehistoric Mesopotamia==\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|Area of the [[Fertile Crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin.

The period was not one of great artistic development, these invaders failing to bring new artistic impetus,<ref>Frankfort, 127</ref> and much religious art was rather self-consciously conservative, perhaps in a deliberate assertion of Sumerian values.<ref>Frankfort, 93</ref> The quality of execution is often lower than in preceding and later periods.<ref>Frankfort, 110-116, 126</ref> Some \"popular\" works of art displayed realism and mouvement, such as the [[:File:Four-faced god, Ishchali, Isin-Larsa to Old Babylonia periods, 2000-1600 BC, bronze - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - (detail).jpg|statuette of a walking four-headed god]] from [[Ishchali]], attributed to the period between 2000\u20131600 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roux |first1=Georges |title=Ancient Iraq |date=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=9780141938257 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC&pg=PT204 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Burney Relief]] is an unusual, elaborate, and relatively large (20\u00d715&nbsp;inches) [[terracotta]] plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions.

This was generally not a period of the highest quality for cylinder seal images; at different times the inscription took prominence over the image, and the variety of scenes shown reduced, with the \"presentation scene\" of a king before a god, or an official before a seated king, becoming the norm at times.<ref>Frankfort, 102-126</ref>  Especially from the [[Kassite]] period several stone [[kudurru]] stelae survive, mostly taken up with inscriptions recording grants of land, boundary lines, and other official records, but often with figures and emblems of the gods or the king as well; a [[Land grant to Marduk-apla-iddina I by Meli-Shipak II|land grant by Meli-Shipak II]] is an example.<ref>Frankfort, 130</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Kudurru_Melishipak_Louvre_Sb23_n02.jpg|[[Kassite]] king [[Meli-Shipak II]] on his throne on a [[kudurru]]-Land grant to \u1e2aunnubat-Nanaya.

From around 879 BC the Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]], originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. \n\nHuman figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' scenes in alabaster, and the [[Lachish reliefs]] showing a war campaign in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], both of which are of the 7th century BC, from Nineveh and now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref> Reliefs were also carved [[rock relief|into rock faces]], as at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]], a style which the Persians continued.\n\nThe Assyrians produced relatively little sculpture in the round, with the partial exception of colossal human-headed ''[[lamassu]]'' guardian figures, with the bodies of lions or bulls, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and often also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor.  A [[Assyrian statue (BM 124963)|single statue of a nude female is known]].  The Assyrian form of the [[winged genie]], winged spirits with bearded human heads seen in reliefs, influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its \"[[orientalizing period]]\" added various winged mythological beasts including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[griffin]] and winged horses ([[Pegasus]]) and men ([[Talos]]).<ref>Frankfort, 205</ref>  Many carry the [[bucket and cone]].\n\nEven before dominating the region the Assyrians had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref>  At [[Nimrud]] the carved [[Nimrud ivories]] and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by [[Phoenicia]]n and Aramaean artisans.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHermitage Nimrud 5.jpg|Winged figure near a sacred tree; 9th century BC; from the palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] ([[Nimrud]], Iraq); [[Hermitage Museum]]\nOpenwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds MET DP110622.jpg|Openwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds; 9th\u20138th century BC; ivory; 12.7\u00d711.91\u00d71.09 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nBritishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg|Relief with two Assyrian cavalrymen charging against enemies; circa 728 BC; gypsum; height: 129 cm, width: 183; [[British Museum]] (London)\nCylinder seal and modern impression- scorpion-man, deities, one on winged lion MET DP-13006-001 (cropped).jpg|Cylinder seal and with deities, on of them being on a winged lion; 8th\u20137th century BC; quartz, crypto-crystalline; 4.09 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:A glazed terracotta tile from Nimrud, Iraq, depicting a court scene, currently housed in the British Museum, London.jpg|Glazed terracotta tile from [[Nimrud]], with a court scene, British Museum\nTransport cedar Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19890.jpg|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar; 713\u2013716 BC; height: 2.41 m, width: 38 cm; [[Louvre]]\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|Relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m\nLion-shaped weight-Sb 2718-P5280901-gradient (cropped).jpg|[[Assyrian lion weights|Lion weight]]; 6th-4th century BC; bronze; height: 29.5 cm, [[Louvre]]\nAncient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920) (14741970056).jpg|Assyrian ornaments and patterns, illustrated in a book from 1920\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian period (626\u2013539 BC)===\n[[Image:Ishtar gate in Pergamon museum in Berlin..jpg|thumb|The [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] of the Ishtar Gate in the [[Pergamon Museum]] ([[Berlin]])]]\n\nThe famous [[Ishtar Gate]], part of which is now reconstructed in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], was the main entrance into [[Babylon]], built in about 575 BC by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], who exiled the Jews; the empire lasted from 626 BC to 539 BC.  The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours.  Lions, dragons and bulls are represented.  The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums.<ref>Frankfort, 203\u2013205</ref>  Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened and decorated with large horizontal metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived, such as the various [[Balawat Gates]].\n\nOther traditional types of art continued to be produced, and the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage.  Many sophisticated and finely carved seals survive.  After Mesopotamia fell to the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with [[Ancient Greek art]], the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged,<ref>Frankfort, 348-349</ref> and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the [[Hellenistic art]] that succeeded the conquest of the region by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nSeal Hero fighting two winged deamons-MBA Lyon E306-IMG 0086.jpg|Seal with a modern impression in which is depicted a hero fighting two female winged deamons; 8th\u20137th century BC; [[chalcedony]]; [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (France)\nConical seal MET vsz1999 325 097.jpg|Conical seal; 7th\u20136th century BC; lapis lazuli; height: 2.7 cm, diameter: 2.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPassing lion Babylon AO21118.jpg|Brick panel of a passing lion, from the ''[[Gate of Ishtar]]''; 605\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta; from Iraq; [[Louvre]]\nFile:20131205 Istanbul 056 (cropped).jpg|One of the [[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]] dragons from the ''Gate of Ishtar''; 604\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta, now [[Istanbul]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Jewellery==\n[[File:Necklace MET an33.35.47.jpg|thumb|Necklace; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and [[lapis lazuli]]; length: 22.5 cm; [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]], Iraq]]\nThe preferred jewellery designs used in [[Mesopotamia]] were natural and geometric motifs such as leaves, cones, spirals, and bunches of grapes. Sumerian and Akkadian jewellery was created from [[gold leaf|gold]] and silver leaf and set with many [[semiprecious stone]]s (mostly [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[jasper]], [[lapis lazuli]] and [[chalcedony]]). A number of documents have been found that relate to the trade and production of jewellery from Sumerian sites. \n\nLater Mesopotamian jewellers and craftsmen employed metalworking techniques such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], granulation, and [[filigree]]. The large variety and size of necklaces, bracelets, anklets, pendants, and pins found may be due to the fact that jewellery was worn by both men and women, and perhaps even children.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nEarring MET DP104223.jpg|Pair of earrings; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nNecklace beads MET DP104225.jpg|Necklace beads; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 54 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEarrings from Shulgi.JPG|Pair or earrings with cuneiform inscriptions, 2093\u20132046 BC; gold; [[Sulaymaniyah Museum]] ([[Sulaymaniyah]], Iraq)\nReconstructed sumerian headgear necklaces british museum.JPG|Sumerian necklaces and headgear discovered in the royal (and individual) graves of the Royal Cemetery at Ur, showing the way they may have been worn, in [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n==Collections==\n{{main|List of museums of ancient Near Eastern art}}\n[[File:Room 300-IMG 7644.JPG|thumb|350px|A room with Mesopotamian art, from the [[Louvre]]]] \nBy some margin, the most important collections are those of (in no particular order) the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum]] (Berlin, Germany), the [[British Museum]] (London), the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City), and the [[National Museum of Iraq]] (Baghdad).

After Grisha nearly had an accident as a result of an accident, trying to get away from the traffic cop, Pavel was surprised to realize that he could lose his son by losing his wife in the past. Grisha lives with full confidence and confidence that his father will save him from any crime. The oligarch is desperate to find a way to influence his son for the better. TV producer Anastasiya (Mariya Mironova), with whom Pavel has long been in a relationship based on sex, invites him to contact his ex-husband, an eccentric psychologist, whose unusual methods may seem cruel and shocking, but almost always give a guaranteed result.\n\nSoon Grisha gets into an accident arranged by his father and loses consciousness. He comes to himself in a stable, the stable is located in the [[abandoned village]], the village - in the estate, and the estate-in the [[Russian Empire]] in the summer of 1860, six months before the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]]. At first Grisha thinks that this is a joke or a practical joke, but the surrounding reality is too real, the surrounding people are really convincing \u2014 and now he is a disenfranchised serf, a master's groom, unable to perform his duties, because he is afraid of horses. In horror, trying to just run away, the runaway groom is on the scaffold, and from the gallows he is saved only by the appearance of Aglaya (Olga Dibtseva), the daughter of a [[Landlord|landowner]], for the sake of whose name day the master (Oleg Komarov) pardons the fugitive. Trying to reason logically, Grisha at first vehemently denies the possibility of falling into the past, but then gradually comes to terms with the position of a [[serf]].\n\nIn reality, the whole village of the 19th century turns out to be a skilful production of Anastasiya and a psychologist, carried out with the huge money of Grisha\u2019s father. The goal of the project is to completely change Grisha\u2019s view of the world around him and himself, for which the team is watching his every move, calculating the intricacies of scenario turns and trying to think through every little thing. Of course, in a situation of permanent wild [[Time trouble|time pressure]], in a situation where not only the actors, but also the scriptwriter inevitably have to constantly improvise, it is impossible to cope with all these trifles. The project is saved mainly by the primeval Grisha ignorance, almost complete lack of even basic knowledge on the history of Russia from constant overlays - anachronisms in the surroundings, modern objects found in the village, [[neologism]]s in the speech of \"[[nobles]]\" and \"[[peasant]]s\".\n\nAccording to the scriptwriter\u2019s plan, an affair with Aglaya should begin, developing into a joint run of a serf with a \"young lady\" and a complete reassessment of life attitudes, but Grisha\u2019s cynicism does not even allow him to realize what a tragedy a girl\u2019s \"threatening marriage\" may be with even a rich but old and, most importantly, unloved landowner. Pavel, who was convinced that his son and in the setting of another era remains the same heartless bastard - moreover, in the 19th century he gradually manages to settle down, dodge some unpleasant realities, seep through others and find a hundred ways that, in general, not bad even get into the role of a slave - in anger, he almost closes the project, but the situation is saved by an unplanned program failure. Grisha accidentally, out of the corner of her eye, remarks that the village girl Liza ([[Aleksandra Bortich]]), who had unsuccessfully jumped from a [[horse]], seems to be wearing modern [[panties]] (Liza is a horse breeder who works with the horses involved in the project, and not an actress, and therefore not was present at the relevant briefing), and intends to immediately check this, in public trying to lift her hem. Seeing the reaction of those around him, Grisha suddenly realizes what exactly he - in terms of the patriarchal peasant community - has just done, and for the first time in his life returns to the person offended by him to ask for forgiveness. Amazed Pavel agrees to continue the project.\n\nTo the team\u2019s surprise, Grisha is honestly linked to Liza, to whom he tells wonderful fairy tales about the future and is glad that at least one person understands him, and if she doesn\u2019t believe him, at least she listens to him. The psychologist proposes to change the scenario and make Lisa the object of Grisha's love. Liza is disgusted with divorce, but she nevertheless agrees to help him change. Along the way, Grisha gradually changes his views on life and himself, watching his own known sins manifest themselves in the son of Lord Aleksey Timofeev, played by a guy named Anton who gets in trouble and Grisha agrees to be punished and abducted for him.\n\nPolina, offended by the loss of the \"leading role\", convinces Anton that Liza beat off Grisha with her quite deliberately, despite the fact that in reality Liza herself really began to feel some sympathy for Grisha. Two offended actors are rapidly finding a common language beyond the scope of their creative task; the accidentally spotted scene of the \"incest\" of \u201cbrother and sister\u201d shock not only Liza, but also Grisha, who is accustomed to everything, the furious Lev Arnoldovich removes \"Aglaya\" and \"Aleksey\" from the roles. In revenge Polina on the show \u201cAndrey Malakhov. Live\u201d publicly talks about the project, where they\u2019re \"torturing a guy\", because of which a criminal case is instituted (kidnapping committed by an organized group - part three of article 126 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]], from six to fifteen years ...) and a wanted list is announced.\nPolina is doing her best to help investigators figure out the location of the attacker's nest. Remained a few hours until the moment when special forces burst into the project site. Anastasiya urgently begins to prepare a plan for \u201cbringing\u201d Grisha back to his usual reality, and Lev conducts an impromptu brain storm to find a way to arrange Grisha\u2019s emergency [[catharsis]], which can nevertheless crack his impenetrable cynicism.\n\nFor this crucial stage of the psychological correction of Grisha's attitudes, a new script is urgently written; in the absence of other options - the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars. The Golden Horde in the 19th century didn\u2019t surprise Grisha at all, but when the turn of the decisive act came - to not allow the Horde to take Liza away for fun \u201cKhan\u201d (Azamat Musagaliyev), he surrendered and desperate runs to his stable. However, to Pavel\u2019s great surprise and no less than the satisfaction of Leo, who was confident in his methods, after a few minutes Grisha still gathered his courage, quickly and professionally saddled his horse, and, having beaten Liza away from the \u201cevil Tatars\u201d, he rode away from the village with her. Just a couple of minutes before the emergence of the [[Police of Russia|police]], which hardly manages to convince that the project is only engaged in pseudo-historical filming.\n\nAt the edge of the forest, already in view of a completely modern gas station, Grisha is euthanized with sleeping pills and, upon awakening, they inform that he, having got under the car, spent three months in a coma and there was no village and no past. Character changes, activated by the transferred experiences, remain with Grisha, but from the realization of Liza\u2019s unreality, he becomes depressed. Having accidentally met the actors Polina and Anton (Aglaya and Aleksey) in the club, he is first ready to believe that he has made up his mind - however, having seen firsthand the torment of Grisha, they still tell him the truth about the project and that love with Liza is he was real. Finding Liza in real life, Grisha stays with her. When Pavel decides to marry Anastasiya, finally confessing to herself that she is much more than a lover for him, congratulate the young Grisha and Liza come together.\n\nIn the last scene of the film in the \"village\" brought in chains and dragged to the gallows another \"fallen into the past\" majeure to his re-established pattern. Grisha, in makeup and costume, with passion and pleasure has been part of the project team, once already proved its effectiveness.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Milos Bikovic]] as Grigoriy 'Grisha' / [[Serf]]\n* [[Aleksandra Bortich]] as Elizaveta 'Liza', a veterinarian, and an actress\n* [[Ivan Okhlobystin]] as Lev, a [[Psychologist|psychologist]]\n* Aleksandr Samoylenko as Pavel, Grisha's father\n* [[Mariya Mironova]] as Anastasiya, TV producer\n* Oleg Komarov as a actor, aka \"master Dmitriy Timofeev\"\n* Kirill Nagiev as Anton is a actor, aka \"Aleksey Timofeev, young master\"<ref>[https://kino.mail.ru/news/50540_sin_nagieva_snimaetsya_v_komedii_holop_pervoe_foto/ \u0421\u044b\u043d \u041d\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u00ab\u0425\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043f\u00bb: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e].

After Grisha nearly had an accident as a result of an accident, trying to get away from the traffic cop, Pavel was surprised to realize that he could lose his son by losing his wife in the past. Grisha lives with full confidence and confidence that his father will save him from any crime. The oligarch is desperate to find a way to influence his son for the better. TV producer Anastasiya (Mariya Mironova), with whom Pavel has long been in a relationship based on sex, invites him to contact his ex-husband, an eccentric psychologist, whose unusual methods may seem cruel and shocking, but almost always give a guaranteed result.\n\nSoon Grisha gets into an accident arranged by his father and loses consciousness. He comes to himself in a stable, the stable is located in the [[abandoned village]], the village - in the estate, and the estate-in the [[Russian Empire]] in the summer of 1860, six months before the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]]. At first Grisha thinks that this is a joke or a practical joke, but the surrounding reality is too real, the surrounding people are really convincing \u2014 and now he is a disenfranchised serf, a master's groom, unable to perform his duties, because he is afraid of horses. In horror, trying to just run away, the runaway groom is on the scaffold, and from the gallows he is saved only by the appearance of Aglaya (Olga Dibtseva), the daughter of a [[Landlord|landowner]], for the sake of whose name day the master (Oleg Komarov) pardons the fugitive. Trying to reason logically, Grisha at first vehemently denies the possibility of falling into the past, but then gradually comes to terms with the position of a [[serf]].\n\nIn reality, the whole village of the 19th century turns out to be a skilful production of Anastasiya and a psychologist, carried out with the huge money of Grisha\u2019s father. The goal of the project is to completely change Grisha\u2019s view of the world around him and himself, for which the team is watching his every move, calculating the intricacies of scenario turns and trying to think through every little thing. Of course, in a situation of permanent wild [[Time trouble|time pressure]], in a situation where not only the actors, but also the scriptwriter inevitably have to constantly improvise, it is impossible to cope with all these trifles. The project is saved mainly by the primeval Grisha ignorance, almost complete lack of even basic knowledge on the history of Russia from constant overlays - anachronisms in the surroundings, modern objects found in the village, [[neologism]]s in the speech of \"[[nobles]]\" and \"[[peasant]]s\".\n\nAccording to the scriptwriter\u2019s plan, an affair with Aglaya should begin, developing into a joint run of a serf with a \"young lady\" and a complete reassessment of life attitudes, but Grisha\u2019s cynicism does not even allow him to realize what a tragedy a girl\u2019s \"threatening marriage\" may be with even a rich but old and, most importantly, unloved landowner. Pavel, who was convinced that his son and in the setting of another era remains the same heartless bastard - moreover, in the 19th century he gradually manages to settle down, dodge some unpleasant realities, seep through others and find a hundred ways that, in general, not bad even get into the role of a slave - in anger, he almost closes the project, but the situation is saved by an unplanned program failure. Grisha accidentally, out of the corner of her eye, remarks that the village girl Liza ([[Aleksandra Bortich]]), who had unsuccessfully jumped from a [[horse]], seems to be wearing modern [[panties]] (Liza is a horse breeder who works with the horses involved in the project, and not an actress, and therefore not was present at the relevant briefing), and intends to immediately check this, in public trying to lift her hem. Seeing the reaction of those around him, Grisha suddenly realizes what exactly he - in terms of the patriarchal peasant community - has just done, and for the first time in his life returns to the person offended by him to ask for forgiveness. Amazed Pavel agrees to continue the project.\n\nTo the team\u2019s surprise, Grisha is honestly linked to Liza, to whom he tells wonderful fairy tales about the future and is glad that at least one person understands him, and if she doesn\u2019t believe him, at least she listens to him. The psychologist proposes to change the scenario and make Lisa the object of Grisha's love. Liza is disgusted with divorce, but she nevertheless agrees to help him change. Along the way, Grisha gradually changes his views on life and himself, watching his own known sins manifest themselves in the son of Lord Aleksey Timofeev, played by a guy named Anton who gets in trouble and Grisha agrees to be punished and abducted for him.\n\nPolina, offended by the loss of the \"leading role\", convinces Anton that Liza beat off Grisha with her quite deliberately, despite the fact that in reality Liza herself really began to feel some sympathy for Grisha. Two offended actors are rapidly finding a common language beyond the scope of their creative task; the accidentally spotted scene of the \"incest\" of \u201cbrother and sister\u201d shock not only Liza, but also Grisha, who is accustomed to everything, the furious Lev Arnoldovich removes \"Aglaya\" and \"Aleksey\" from the roles. In revenge Polina on the show \u201cAndrey Malakhov. Live\u201d publicly talks about the project, where they\u2019re \"torturing a guy\", because of which a criminal case is instituted (kidnapping committed by an organized group - part three of article 126 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]], from six to fifteen years ...) and a wanted list is announced.\nPolina is doing her best to help investigators figure out the location of the attacker's nest. Remained a few hours until the moment when special forces burst into the project site. Anastasiya urgently begins to prepare a plan for \u201cbringing\u201d Grisha back to his usual reality, and Lev conducts an impromptu brain storm to find a way to arrange Grisha\u2019s emergency [[catharsis]], which can nevertheless crack his impenetrable cynicism.\n\nFor this crucial stage of the psychological correction of Grisha's attitudes, a new script is urgently written; in the absence of other options - the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars. The Golden Horde in the 19th century didn\u2019t surprise Grisha at all, but when the turn of the decisive act came - to not allow the Horde to take Liza away for fun \u201cKhan\u201d (Azamat Musagaliyev), he surrendered and desperate runs to his stable. However, to Pavel\u2019s great surprise and no less than the satisfaction of Leo, who was confident in his methods, after a few minutes Grisha still gathered his courage, quickly and professionally saddled his horse, and, having beaten Liza away from the \u201cevil Tatars\u201d, he rode away from the village with her. Just a couple of minutes before the emergence of the [[Police of Russia|police]], which hardly manages to convince that the project is only engaged in pseudo-historical filming.\n\nAt the edge of the forest, already in view of a completely modern gas station, Grisha is euthanized with sleeping pills and, upon awakening, they inform that he, having got under the car, spent three months in a coma and there was no village and no past. Character changes, activated by the transferred experiences, remain with Grisha, but from the realization of Liza\u2019s unreality, he becomes depressed.

While Pius rejected charges of [[antisemitism]], the rift created by the [[Mortara Affair]] undermined his moral authority throughout most of his long pontificate.    \n\n==Status in the Papal States== \nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had considerably more rights than members of other religions. Protestants and Jews were not admitted to the Papal government, or to the social circles of Rome, nor did they have the same standing as members of the Catholic faith. The precise legal difference is difficult to pin down, as there existed no bill of rights or even a clear collection of laws in the Papal States at the time of Pius IX.<ref>Schmidlin 44 ff</ref> Even ecclesiastical laws ([[canon law]]) were not formalized until 1917, some forty years after the death of Pope Pius IX.\n\nEarly in his pontificate, in 1847, Pius IX baptized four Roman Jews and welcomed them personally with warm words into the Catholic Church.<ref>Pougeois I, p. 184.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Pio9carriage.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The Papal carriage of Pius IX]]\n\n==Legislative discrimination and intolerance==\nAt Pius IX's accession in 1846, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]] were the only [[religion]]s allowed by law ([[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[worship]] was allowed to visiting foreigners, but forbidden to Italians; [[atheism]] was unthinkable). Jews in Rome were required to live [[Roman ghetto|in a ghetto]], a separated quarter of the city, and had very limited rights. His relations with them changed over time, from good to worse. He initially repealed laws that forbade Jews to practice certain professions and rescinded laws which forced them to listen four times per year to [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]]s aimed at their conversion.\n\nAfter the pope's 1849 overthrow, the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued wide ranging religious freedom measures. After French troops brought him back to power in 1850,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures that eliminated even some his early openings, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III,258</ref>\n\n==Mortara affair==\nIn 1858 in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was seized from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill six years earlier, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the Papal States law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even their own parents, and considered the informal baptism performed by the teen-age servant a valid religious conversion. Pius IX thereafter steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> \n\nWhen a delegation of prominent Jews saw the Pope, he brought Mortara with him to show that the boy was happy in his care.

While Pius rejected charges of [[antisemitism]], the rift created by the [[Mortara Affair]] undermined his moral authority throughout most of his long pontificate.    \n\n==Status in the Papal States== \nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had considerably more rights than members of other religions. Protestants and Jews were not admitted to the Papal government, or to the social circles of Rome, nor did they have the same standing as members of the Catholic faith. The precise legal difference is difficult to pin down, as there existed no bill of rights or even a clear collection of laws in the Papal States at the time of Pius IX.<ref>Schmidlin 44 ff</ref> Even ecclesiastical laws ([[canon law]]) were not formalized until 1917, some forty years after the death of Pope Pius IX.\n\nEarly in his pontificate, in 1847, Pius IX baptized four Roman Jews and welcomed them personally with warm words into the Catholic Church.<ref>Pougeois I, p. 184.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Pio9carriage.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The Papal carriage of Pius IX]]\n\n==Legislative discrimination and intolerance==\nAt Pius IX's accession in 1846, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]] were the only [[religion]]s allowed by law ([[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[worship]] was allowed to visiting foreigners, but forbidden to Italians; [[atheism]] was unthinkable). Jews in Rome were required to live [[Roman ghetto|in a ghetto]], a separated quarter of the city, and had very limited rights. His relations with them changed over time, from good to worse. He initially repealed laws that forbade Jews to practice certain professions and rescinded laws which forced them to listen four times per year to [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]]s aimed at their conversion.\n\nAfter the pope's 1849 overthrow, the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued wide ranging religious freedom measures. After French troops brought him back to power in 1850,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures that eliminated even some his early openings, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III,258</ref>\n\n==Mortara affair==\nIn 1858 in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was seized from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill six years earlier, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the Papal States law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even their own parents, and considered the informal baptism performed by the teen-age servant a valid religious conversion. Pius IX thereafter steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> \n\nWhen a delegation of prominent Jews saw the Pope, he brought Mortara with him to show that the boy was happy in his care. In 1865 he said: \"I had the right and the duty to do what I did for this boy, and if I had to, I would do it again.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = James | last = Carroll | title = ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews &mdash; A History'' | pages = 379&ndash;380 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-618-21908-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Kenneth | last = Stowe | title = ''Popes, Church, and Jews in the Middle Ages: Confrontation and Response'' | pages = 57&ndash;58 | publisher = Ashgate Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7546-5915-1}}</ref>\n\nCalls from ''[[The Times]]'' and from numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.
