Also known as ''Sheer Thursday'' in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there.  Holy Thursday is part of [[Holy Week]].\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Thursdays are dedicated to the [[Apostles]] and [[Saint Nicholas]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains [[hymn]]s on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year.  At the end of [[Divine Services]] on Thursday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure [[Theotokos|Mother]], of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our [[Holy Fathers|Father]] among the [[saint]]s Nicholas, [[Archbishop]] of [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], the [[Wonder-worker]]\u2026\"\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Thursday]] is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into [[Heaven]].\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do [[Fasting in Islam#Days of voluntary fasting|voluntary fasting]], the other being Mondays.

The [[Didache]] warned early [[Christians]] not to fast on Thursdays to avoid [[Judaizers|Judaizing]], and suggested Fridays instead.\n\nIn Judaism the [[Torah]] is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.\n\n===Practices in Countries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn Buddhist Thailand Thursday is considered the \"Teacher's Day\", and it is believed that one should begin one's education on this auspicious day.

And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Thai solar calendar]], the colour associated with Thursday is orange.\n\nIn the United States, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\n===Conventional weekly events===\nIn Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly.

Also known as ''Sheer Thursday'' in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there.  Holy Thursday is part of [[Holy Week]].\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Thursdays are dedicated to the [[Apostles]] and [[Saint Nicholas]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains [[hymn]]s on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year.  At the end of [[Divine Services]] on Thursday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure [[Theotokos|Mother]], of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our [[Holy Fathers|Father]] among the [[saint]]s Nicholas, [[Archbishop]] of [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], the [[Wonder-worker]]\u2026\"\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Thursday]] is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into [[Heaven]].\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do [[Fasting in Islam#Days of voluntary fasting|voluntary fasting]], the other being Mondays.

The [[Didache]] warned early [[Christians]] not to fast on Thursdays to avoid [[Judaizers|Judaizing]], and suggested Fridays instead.\n\nIn Judaism the [[Torah]] is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.\n\n===Practices in Countries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn Buddhist Thailand Thursday is considered the \"Teacher's Day\", and it is believed that one should begin one's education on this auspicious day. Thai students still pay homages to their teachers in specific ceremony always held on a selected Thursday. And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Thai solar calendar]], the colour associated with Thursday is orange.\n\nIn the United States, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\n\n===Conventional weekly events===\nIn Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly. Shopping malls see this as an opportunity to open longer than usual, generally until 9 pm, as most pay cheques are cleared by Thursday morning.\n\nIn Norway, Thursday has also traditionally been the day when most shops and malls are open later than on the other weekdays, although the majority of shopping malls now are open until 8 pm or 9 pm every weekday.\n\nIn the USSR of the 1970s and 1980s Thursday was the \"Fish Day\" ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c|\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c]]}}, ''Rybny den''), when the nation's [[foodservice]] establishments were supposed to serve fish (rather than meat) dishes.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Irina |last=Petrosian|first2= David |last2=Underwood|year=2006\n|isbn=1411698657|title=Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore|series=Armenian Research Center collection\n|edition=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0oXYX9Qzx9oC&pg=PA115\n|page=115}}</ref>\n\nFor college and university students, Thursday is sometimes referred to as the new Friday.

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]]. Mehmed II not only allowed the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to remain active in the city after [[fall of Constantinople|its conquest]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, he also established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in 1461, as part of the [[Millet system]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].

The Presidency of Religious Affairs' budget rose from USD $0.9 billion for the year 2006 to $2.5 billion in 2012.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the role of religion in the state has been a divisive issue, as influential religious factions challenged the complete secularization called for by [[Kemalism]] and the observance of Islamic practices experienced a substantial revival.

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]]. Mehmed II not only allowed the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to remain active in the city after [[fall of Constantinople|its conquest]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, he also established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in 1461, as part of the [[Millet system]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].
