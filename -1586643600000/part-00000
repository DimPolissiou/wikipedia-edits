The digging of the new section of burial pits began on 21 February, only two days after the government announced their first cases of COVID-19, and then rapidly expanded. The number of fresh graves suggests preparation for a far larger number of deaths.<ref>*{{cite

The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the autobiographical chapters from the best selling 1993 [[Private Parts (book)|book of the same name]] by radio personality [[Howard Stern]], developed from a script written by [[Len Blum]] and Michael Kalesniko. It follows Stern's life from boyhood and his rise to success in radio. Stern and several of [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] star as themselves, including newscaster and co-host [[Robin Quivers]], producers [[Fred Norris]] and [[Gary Dell'Abate]], and comedian [[Jackie Martling]]. The film also stars [[Mary McCormack]], [[Allison Janney]], and [[Paul Giamatti]].\n\nAfter a proposed film featuring Stern as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]] fell through, development for a new film began in 1994, several months following the release of ''Private Parts''. Stern signed with [[Rysher Entertainment]], who agreed to fund it, and teamed with  Reitman who thought a biographical take on Stern's life was best suited for a film. Production was delayed after Stern rejected 22 scripts from several screenwriters until he accepted one developed by Blum and Kalesniko in late 1995. Filming took place in the [[New York City]] area and [[Washington, D.C.]] from May to November 1996 with a budget of $28 million, during which Stern continued to host his radio show each weekday morning. Numerous celebrities and family members of the radio show staff make [[cameo appearances]] in the film. The soundtrack is formed of songs from several rock bands as well as two original tracks featuring Stern performing with [[Rob Zombie]] and [[Dust Brothers|the Dust Brothers]]. The film's score was composed and conducted by [[Basil Poledouris]].\n\nReleased in the United States on March 7, 1997 by [[Paramount Pictures]], ''Private Parts'' ranked at number one on the US [[box office]] in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million. It grossed a domestic total of $41.2 million at the end of its theatrical run. It received mostly positive reviews from film critics, a group whom Stern made a conscious effort to please, including the public who did not listen to the radio show or were not fans of his. In 1998, the film was released on [[DVD]] and Stern won a Blockbuster Award for Favorite Male Newcomer for his performance. Stern shot additional scenes for a censored version of the film prior to its premiere television broadcast on the [[USA Network]] in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his appearance at the [[MTV Music Video Awards]] as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]], radio personality [[Howard Stern]] boards his flight home and is seated next to Gloria who is visibly repelled by him. Stern, thinking she sees him as a moron, begins to tell his life story, starting with the verbal abuse he received as a boy from his father Ben. As a youngster, Stern dreams of being on the radio after visiting his father's recording studio and grows up to be a quiet, socially awkward teenager. He decides to work in radio and studies Communications at [[Boston University]]. He becomes a DJ at [[WTBU (college radio)|WTBU]], the college station, and meets his girlfriend Alison.\n\nAfter graduating, Howard works at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] and is promoted to program director, which allows him to marry Alison. He leaves after being asked to fire a fellow DJ and moves to [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he befriends DJ [[Fred Norris]]. Howard adopts a more casual attitude on the air, becoming more open and upfront. He and Fred attend the premiere of actress Brittany Fairchild's new film. The three leave early for Fairchild's hotel room, where she strips for a bath and convinces Howard and Fred to join in. Brittany's behavior becomes more sexual, and an embarrassed Howard leaves. When Alison finds his wet underwear in their car and believes he has been unfaithful, she leaves him. Howard leaves Hartford for [[WLLZ (FM)|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and is miserable, but Alison goes to Detroit and forgives him. WWWW then switches to country music, and Howard quits.\n\nHoward starts at [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1981 and meets his news anchor [[Robin Quivers]], whom he encourages to riff with him on the air. They refuse orders from boss Dee Dee for constantly breaking format. One of their antics, in which Howard assists a female caller to reach orgasm, almost gets him fired until a ratings boost forces Dee Dee to keep him and hire Fred to the team. Meanwhile, Alison announces her pregnancy, but it ends in [[miscarriage]]. Although they cheer each other up by joking about it, Howard makes light of the situation on the air, which greatly upsets Alison.\n\nWith Alison pregnant again, Howard gets his dream offer to work in [[New York City]] at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], where he has the chance to become a nationwide success. However, upper management at [[NBC]] hired Howard not realizing what his show was like until they see a news report about him. Program director Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton offers to keep Howard in line or he will force him to quit. Howard, Fred, and Robin ignore Kenny's restrictions on content until a risque Match Game with comedian [[Jackie Martling]] causes Rushton to fire Robin. The show fails in her absence and her replacement quits after Howard's interview with an actress who swallows a kielbasa sausage. Robin is eventually brought back, but Howard's antics continue with a naked woman in the studio, resulting in Kenny cutting off the broadcast. Howard gets the show back on the air and gets into a physical altercation with Kenny in his office.\n\nIn 1985, Howard becomes number one at WNBC and Kenny tries to gain Howard's friendship but is turned down flat. Howard thanks his fans with an outdoor concert by [[AC/DC]]. During the performance, Alison is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to a daughter. Back on the flight, it is revealed that Howard has told his story to Gloria and believes he could get her, but stays \"loyal\" to Alison. He meets Alison at the airport and his daughters run to greet him.\n\nDuring the end credits, [[John Melendez|Stuttering John]] rants about his absence in the film. [[Mia Farrow]] then presents an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Howard at the awards ceremony, who appears as Fartman once again, but Howard falls from mid-air and the audience applauds. Kenny is out of radio and now manages a shopping mall in [[Alabama]] and blames Howard for his downfall. During his outbursts, his swearing is drowned out by jackhammer noises.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Howard Stern]] as himself/narrator\n** Bobby Boriello as 7-year-old Howard \n** Michael Maccarone as 12-year-old Howard\n** [[Matthew Friedman]] as 16-year-old Howard\n* [[Robin Quivers]] as herself\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Alison Stern\n* [[Fred Norris]] as himself\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton\n* [[Carol Alt]] as Gloria\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dee Dee\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Roger Elick\n* [[Jenna Jameson]] as Mandy\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Ben Stern\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Ray Stern\n* Sasha Martin as Emily Beth Stern\n* [[Sarah Hyland]] as Debra Jennifer Stern\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Vin Vallesecca\n* Melanie Good as Brittany Fairchild\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as the WNBC Page/Tour Guide\n* [[Camille Donatacci|Camille Donatacci Grammer]] as Camille the Card Girl\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Alison's friend\n* [[Amber Smith]] as Julie\n* [[Janine Lindemulder]] as Camp Director's Wife\n* [[Michael C.

In a review for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', critic [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film three and a half stars out of five. He pointed out the \"predictable\" scenes of \"lesbian jokes and toilet humor\", but the \"wonderful love story\" between Stern and Alison is the most surprising aspect and preferred Stern's character off the air than the one on the radio. Siskel concluded his review by singling out the scenes of Stern courting Alison, his eagerness to have a baby, and his apology to Alison as \"signature moments\" of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-07/entertainment/9703070167_1_howard-stern-kama-sutra-love-story|title=Love story endearing in 'Parts'|first=Gene|last=Siskel|date=March 7, 1997|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the film for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', giving it three stars out of four.

The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the autobiographical chapters from the best selling 1993 [[Private Parts (book)|book of the same name]] by radio personality [[Howard Stern]], developed from a script written by [[Len Blum]] and Michael Kalesniko. It follows Stern's life from boyhood and his rise to success in radio. Stern and several of [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] star as themselves, including newscaster and co-host [[Robin Quivers]], producers [[Fred Norris]] and [[Gary Dell'Abate]], and comedian [[Jackie Martling]]. The film also stars [[Mary McCormack]], [[Allison Janney]], and [[Paul Giamatti]].\n\nAfter a proposed film featuring Stern as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]] fell through, development for a new film began in 1994, several months following the release of ''Private Parts''. Stern signed with [[Rysher Entertainment]], who agreed to fund it, and teamed with  Reitman who thought a biographical take on Stern's life was best suited for a film. Production was delayed after Stern rejected 22 scripts from several screenwriters until he accepted one developed by Blum and Kalesniko in late 1995. Filming took place in the [[New York City]] area and [[Washington, D.C.]] from May to November 1996 with a budget of $28 million, during which Stern continued to host his radio show each weekday morning. Numerous celebrities and family members of the radio show staff make [[cameo appearances]] in the film. The soundtrack is formed of songs from several rock bands as well as two original tracks featuring Stern performing with [[Rob Zombie]] and [[Dust Brothers|the Dust Brothers]]. The film's score was composed and conducted by [[Basil Poledouris]].\n\nReleased in the United States on March 7, 1997 by [[Paramount Pictures]], ''Private Parts'' ranked at number one on the US [[box office]] in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million. It grossed a domestic total of $41.2 million at the end of its theatrical run. It received mostly positive reviews from film critics, a group whom Stern made a conscious effort to please, including the public who did not listen to the radio show or were not fans of his. In 1998, the film was released on [[DVD]] and Stern won a Blockbuster Award for Favorite Male Newcomer for his performance. Stern shot additional scenes for a censored version of the film prior to its premiere television broadcast on the [[USA Network]] in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his appearance at the [[MTV Music Video Awards]] as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]], radio personality [[Howard Stern]] boards his flight home and is seated next to Gloria who is visibly repelled by him. Stern, thinking she sees him as a moron, begins to tell his life story, starting with the verbal abuse he received as a boy from his father Ben. As a youngster, Stern dreams of being on the radio after visiting his father's recording studio and grows up to be a quiet, socially awkward teenager. He decides to work in radio and studies Communications at [[Boston University]]. He becomes a DJ at [[WTBU (college radio)|WTBU]], the college station, and meets his girlfriend Alison.\n\nAfter graduating, Howard works at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] and is promoted to program director, which allows him to marry Alison. He leaves after being asked to fire a fellow DJ and moves to [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he befriends DJ [[Fred Norris]]. Howard adopts a more casual attitude on the air, becoming more open and upfront. He and Fred attend the premiere of actress Brittany Fairchild's new film. The three leave early for Fairchild's hotel room, where she strips for a bath and convinces Howard and Fred to join in. Brittany's behavior becomes more sexual, and an embarrassed Howard leaves. When Alison finds his wet underwear in their car and believes he has been unfaithful, she leaves him. Howard leaves Hartford for [[WLLZ (FM)|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and is miserable, but Alison goes to Detroit and forgives him. WWWW then switches to country music, and Howard quits.\n\nHoward starts at [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1981 and meets his news anchor [[Robin Quivers]], whom he encourages to riff with him on the air. They refuse orders from boss Dee Dee for constantly breaking format. One of their antics, in which Howard assists a female caller to reach orgasm, almost gets him fired until a ratings boost forces Dee Dee to keep him and hire Fred to the team. Meanwhile, Alison announces her pregnancy, but it ends in [[miscarriage]]. Although they cheer each other up by joking about it, Howard makes light of the situation on the air, which greatly upsets Alison.\n\nWith Alison pregnant again, Howard gets his dream offer to work in [[New York City]] at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], where he has the chance to become a nationwide success. However, upper management at [[NBC]] hired Howard not realizing what his show was like until they see a news report about him. Program director Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton offers to keep Howard in line or he will force him to quit. Howard, Fred, and Robin ignore Kenny's restrictions on content until a risque Match Game with comedian [[Jackie Martling]] causes Rushton to fire Robin. The show fails in her absence and her replacement quits after Howard's interview with an actress who swallows a kielbasa sausage. Robin is eventually brought back, but Howard's antics continue with a naked woman in the studio, resulting in Kenny cutting off the broadcast. Howard gets the show back on the air and gets into a physical altercation with Kenny in his office.\n\nIn 1985, Howard becomes number one at WNBC and Kenny tries to gain Howard's friendship but is turned down flat. Howard thanks his fans with an outdoor concert by [[AC/DC]]. During the performance, Alison is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to a daughter. Back on the flight, it is revealed that Howard has told his story to Gloria and believes he could get her, but stays \"loyal\" to Alison. He meets Alison at the airport and his daughters run to greet him.\n\nDuring the end credits, [[John Melendez|Stuttering John]] rants about his absence in the film. [[Mia Farrow]] then presents an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Howard at the awards ceremony, who appears as Fartman once again, but Howard falls from mid-air and the audience applauds. Kenny is out of radio and now manages a shopping mall in [[Alabama]] and blames Howard for his downfall. During his outbursts, his swearing is drowned out by jackhammer noises.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Howard Stern]] as himself/narrator\n** Bobby Boriello as 7-year-old Howard \n** Michael Maccarone as 12-year-old Howard\n** [[Matthew Friedman]] as 16-year-old Howard\n* [[Robin Quivers]] as herself\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Alison Stern\n* [[Fred Norris]] as himself\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton\n* [[Carol Alt]] as Gloria\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dee Dee\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Roger Elick\n* [[Jenna Jameson]] as Mandy\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Ben Stern\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Ray Stern\n* Sasha Martin as Emily Beth Stern\n* [[Sarah Hyland]] as Debra Jennifer Stern\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Vin Vallesecca\n* Melanie Good as Brittany Fairchild\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as the WNBC Page/Tour Guide\n* [[Camille Donatacci|Camille Donatacci Grammer]] as Camille the Card Girl\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Alison's friend\n* [[Amber Smith]] as Julie\n* [[Janine Lindemulder]] as Camp Director's Wife\n* [[Michael C.

The tuatara is the only living [[tetrapod]] with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.\n\nIn the early tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, together with bony elements such as bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and [[clavicle]]s (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land.

The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna on Little Barrier Island|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/auckland/hauraki-gulf-islands/little-barrier-island-nature-reserve-hauturu-o-toi/features/#fauna|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hen and Chicken Islands]], Polynesian rats were eradicated on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles have once again been seen on the latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara have been seen there as of 2001. In the [[Alderman Islands]], Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this.<ref name=recovery /> Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of [[D'Urville Island, New Zealand|D'Urville Island]], to prepare for the release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.<ref name=recovery /><!--can we find out whether this plan was followed through?-->\n[[File:Tuatara karori head.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tuatara at the [[Karori Wildlife Sanctuary|Karori Sanctuary]] are given coloured markings on the head for identification.]]\n\n====Brothers Island tuatara====\n''Sphenodon guntheri'' is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400. In 1995, 50 juvenile and 18 adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, more than half of the animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight.

[[southland museum and art gallery|Southland Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Invercargill]] was the first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme; they breed ''S. punctatus''.\n\n[[Hamilton Zoo]], [[Auckland Zoo]] and [[Wellington Zoo]] also breed tuatara for release into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was discovered that the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the animal.\n\nThe [[Victoria University of Wellington]] maintains a research programme into the captive breeding of tuatara, and the [[Mt Bruce Wildlife Centre|Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre]] keeps a pair and a juvenile.\n\nThe WildNZ Trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at [[Ruawai]]. One notable captive breeding success story took place in January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110-year-old tuatara Henry and 80-year-old tuatara Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed.<ref name=\"CNNDad\"/>\n\nIn January 2016, [[Chester Zoo]], England, announced that they succeeded in breeding the tuatara in captivity for the first time outside its homeland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/tuatura-lizard-like-reptile-takes-38-years-to-lay-an-egg-in-chester-zoo-a6844041.html|title=Tuatara: Lizard-like reptile takes 38 years to lay an egg in Chester Zoo| newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=31 January 2016|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural significance==\nTuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends, and are held as ''ariki'' (God forms).

It was replaced by the [[United States biological defense program]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1918\u20131941)===\n\nThe '''[[United States]] [[biological weapons]] program''' officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations.

Absurdism is related to {{gli|existentialism}}, though should not be confused with it, nor with {{gli|nihilism}}.}}\n\n{{term|[[Tychism|accidentalism]]}}\n{{defn|Any system of thought that denies the causal nexus and maintains that events succeed one another haphazardly or by chance (not in the mathematical but in the popular sense). In {{gli|metaphysics}}, accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause. In this connection it is synonymous with {{gli|tychism}} (ruxi, chance), a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for the theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.}}\n\n{{term|[[acosmism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophy that denies the reality of the [[Universe]], seeing it as ultimately illusory, and only the infinite Unmanifest Absolute as real. In contrast to {{gli|pantheism}}, acosmism begins with the recognition that there is only one Reality, which is infinite, non-dual, blissful, etc. Yet the phenomenal reality of which humans are normally aware is none of these things; it is in fact just the opposite\u2014i.e., dualistic, finite, full of suffering and pain, and so on. And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not Absolute cannot be real. Thus, according to this viewpoint, the phenomenal dualistic world is ultimately an illusion (\"Maya\" to use the technical Indian term), irrespective of the apparent reality it possesses at the mundane or empirical level.}}\n\n{{term|[[aestheticism]]}}\n{{defn|A loosely defined movement in [[art]] and [[literature]] popular in later 19th-century [[United Kingdom|Britain]] which held that art does not have any didactic purpose (it need only be beautiful), and that life should imitate art. The main characteristics of the movement were suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects \u2013 that is, correspondence between words, colors, and music.}}\n\n{{term|[[agnostic atheism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophical view that encompasses both {{gli|atheism}} and {{gli|agnosticism}}. Due to definitional variance, an agnostic atheist does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true that \"the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable\", or that \"knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant\", or that \"abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal\". Contrast ''{{gli|agnostic theism}}''.}}\n\n{{term|[[agnostic theism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophical view that encompasses both {{gli|theism}} and {{gli|agnosticism}}. An agnostic theist is one who views that the {{gli|truth value}} of claims regarding the existence of [[God]] or gods is unknown or inherently unknowable, but still chooses to believe in God or gods in spite of this. Contrast ''{{gli|agnostic atheism}}''.}}\n\n{{term|[[agnosticism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophical view that the {{gli|truth value|truth values}} of certain claims \u2014 particularly {{gli|theology|theological}} claims regarding the existence of {{gli|monotheism|God}}, {{gli|polytheism|gods}}, or [[deity|deities]] \u2014 are unknown, inherently unknowable, or incoherent, and therefore irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. Agnosticism itself, in both its strong (explicit) and weak (implicit) forms, is necessarily neither an {{gli|atheism|atheist}} nor a {{gli|theism|theist}} position, though an agnostic person may also be either an atheist, a theist, or one who endorses neither position.}}\n\n{{term|[[altruism]]}}\n{{defn|The belief that people have a {{gli|morality|moral}} obligation to serve others or the \"greater good\". It is generally opposed to the concepts of self-interest and {{gli|egoism}}.}}\n\n{{term|''[[amor fati]]''}}\n{{defn|A [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as \"love of fate\" or \"love of one's fate\". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by a passive acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.<ref name=\"ds\">{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}</ref>}}\n\n{{term|[[anarchism]]}}\n{{defn|The political position of any of a number of views and movements which advocate the absence or elimination of rulership or government. Other than being opposed to the [[State (polity)|state]], there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold. Compare and contrast ''{{gli|libertarianism}}''.}}\n\n{{term|[[anarcho-capitalism]]}}\n{{defn|A philosophy based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]], and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]]. It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals. From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] as an unjustified monopolist and aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] {{gli|capitalism}}. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through taxation, with private, competing businesses.}}\n\n{{term|[[anarcho-primitivism]]}}\n{{defn|An {{gli|anarchism|anarchist}} critique of the origins and progress of civilization. Primitivists argue that the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]]s to [[agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. They advocate a return to non-\"civilized\" ways of life through [[industrialisation|deindustrialisation]], abolition of [[division of labour]] or specialization, and abandonment of technology.}}\n\n{{term|[[anarcho-syndicalism]]}}\n{{defn|A form of anarchism that allies itself with [[syndicalism]], that is, with [[labor union]]s, as a force for revolutionary social change. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to replace capitalism and the state with a democratically worker-managed means of production. They seek to abolish the wage system and most forms of private property.}}\n\n{{term|[[animism]]}}\n{{defn|\"Animism\" has been applied to many different philosophical systems. This includes [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[stoics]] and [[scholastics]]. On the other hand, [[monadology]] ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) has also been described as animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the ''world soul'', held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others. Lastly, in discussions of religion, \"animism\" refers to the belief in indwelling souls or spirits, particularly so-called \"primitive\" religions that consider everything inhabited by spirits.}}\n\n{{term|[[anthropocentrism]]}}\n{{ghat|Also called '''homocentrism'''.}}\n{{defn|The practice, conscious or otherwise, of regarding the existence and/or concerns of [[human being]]s as the central fact of the [[Universe]]. This is similar, but not identical, to the practice of relating all that happens in the universe to the human experience. To clarify, the first position concludes that the fact of human existence is the point of universal existence; the latter merely compares all activity to that of humanity, without making any [[teleology|teleological]] conclusions.}}\n\n{{term|[[anthropomorphism]]}}\n{{defn|A form of [[personification]] involving the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena. [[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to God (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. Anthropomorphism is similar to '''prosopopoeia''' (adopting the persona of another person).<ref name=\"Oxford\">Blackburn, Simon. ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', Oxford University Press, 1994. This dictionary includes an entry for this word.</ref>}}\n\n{{term|[[antinatalism]]}}\n{{defn|A philosophical position that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is morally bad.}}\n\n{{term|[[Antinomianism]]}}\n{{defn|In {{gli|theology}}, the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the [[religious law|laws]] of {{gli|ethics}} or {{gli|morality}} as presented by religious authorities. Antinomianism is the polar opposite of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]], the notion that obedience to a code of religious law is necessary for [[salvation]]. The term has become a point of contention among opposed religious authorities. Few groups or sects explicitly call themselves \"antinomian\", but the charge is often levelled by some sects against competing sects.}}\n\n{{term|[[anti-realism]]}}\n{{defn|Any position involving either the denial of the objective reality of entities of a certain type or the insistence that humans should be {{gli|agnosticism|agnostic}} about their real existence. Thus, people may speak of anti-realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the material world, or even thought.}}\n\n{{term|[[Aristotelianism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophical tradition that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school]]. Sometimes contrasted by critics with the rationalism and idealism of [[Plato]], Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories. Most particularly, Aristotelianism brings Plato's ideals down to Earth as goals and goods internal to natural species that are realized in activity. This is the characteristically Aristotelian idea of {{gli|teleology}}.}}\n\n{{term|[[Arminianism]]}}\n{{defn|A school of {{gli|soteriology|soteriological}} thought in [[Protestant]] [[Christian theology]] founded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Arminianism is closely related to [[Calvinism]] (or Reformed theology), and the two systems share both their histories and many doctrines in common.}}\n\n{{term|[[asceticism]]}}\n{{defn|A way of life characterised by an [[austerity|austere]] existence that refrains from worldly pleasures. Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as [[virtue|virtuous]] and pursue them to achieve greater [[spirituality]]. In a more cynical context, asceticism may connote some form of self-mortification, ritual punishment of the body, or harsh renunciation of pleasure, though the word itself does not necessarily imply a negative connotation.}}\n\n{{term|[[ascriptivism]]}}\n{{defn|The view that human beings are to be held responsible for their actions even if {{gli|determinism}} is true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ismbook.com/ascriptivism.html |title=ascriptivism |publisher=Ismbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>}}\n\n{{term|[[associationalism]]}}\n{{defn|A political project where \"human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations\".<ref name=\"Hirst112\">Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.</ref> Associationalism \"gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows\"<ref name=\"Hirst112\"/>}}\n\n{{term|[[atheism]]}}\n{{defn|The absence of belief in the existence of [[God]] or [[deity|gods]], thus contrasting with {{gli|theism}}; a condition of being without theistic beliefs. This definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods and those who maintain no beliefs at all regarding the existence of gods. However, narrower definitions often only qualify the former as atheism, with the latter falling under the more general (but rarely used) term {{gli|nontheism}}.}}\n\n{{term|[[atomism]]}}\n{{defn|The theory that all objects in the Universe are composed of very small, [[Eternity|indestructible]] elements called [[atom]]s. (This is the case for the Western [i.e., Greek] theories of atomism. Buddhists also have well-developed theories of atomism, which involve momentary, or non-eternal, atoms, that flash in and out of existence).}}\n\n{{term|[[authoritarianism]]}}\n{{defn|An [[organization]] or a [[State (polity)|state]] that enforces strong, and sometimes oppressive measures against those in its sphere of influence, generally without attempts at gaining their consent and often not allowing feedback on its policies. In an authoritarian state, citizens are subject to state authority in many aspects of their lives, including many that other [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] would see as matters of personal choice. There are various degrees of authoritarianism; even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent, for example in areas of national security.}}\n\n{{term|[[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]}}\n{{ghat|Also called '''surrealist automatism'''.}}\n{{defn|An artistic technique of spontaneous writing, drawing, or the like that is practiced without conscious aesthetic or moral self-censorship.}}\n\n{{Glossary end}}{{Compact ToC|side=yes|center=yes|top=yes|symnum=no|seealso=yes|refs=yes|nobreak=yes}}\n\n==B==\n{{Glossary}}\n\n{{term|[[behavioralism]]}}\n{{defn|An approach in [[political science]] that seeks to provide an objective, quantified approach to explaining and predicting political behavior. It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the natural sciences. It should not be confused with the {{gli|behaviorism}} of [[psychology]].}}\n\n{{term|[[behaviorism]]}}\n{{defn|An approach to [[psychology]] based on the proposition that behavior can be researched [[Scientific method|scientifically]] without recourse to inner mental states. It is a form of {{gli|materialism}}, denying any independent significance for the mind. Its significance for psychological treatment has been profound, making it one of the pillars of [[pharmacological]] therapy. It should not be confused with the {{gli|behavioralism}} of [[political science]].}}\n\n{{term|[[biologism]]}}\n{{ghat|Also called '''biological determinism'''.}}\n{{defn|The interpretation of humans and human life from a strictly [[biological]] point of view. It is closely related to and often used interchangeably with ''genetic determinism''.}}\n\n{{term|[[Buddhism]]}}\n{{defn|A [[dharmic religion]] and [[philosophy]] based on the teachings of the Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]]. The basic teachings of Buddhism have to do with the nature of suffering or dissatisfaction (''dukkha'') and its avoidance through ethical principles (the Eightfold Path). Buddhism originated in [[India]], and is today largely followed in East Asia, including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Tibet]], and [[Thailand]]. Buddhism is divided into different sects and movements, of which the largest are the [[Mahayana]], [[Theravada]], and [[Vajrayana]].}}\n\n{{Glossary end}}{{Compact ToC|side=yes|center=yes|top=yes|symnum=no|seealso=yes|refs=yes|nobreak=yes}}\n\n==C==\n{{Glossary}}\n\n{{term|[[capitalism]]}}\n{{defn|An [[economic system]] in which all or most of the [[means of production]] are [[private property|privately owned]] and [[management|operated]] (usually through [[employment|employing]] [[wage]] [[labour (economics)|labour]], and for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), and in which the [[investment]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[logistics|distribution]] and [[price]]s of [[commodities]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are determined mainly in a [[free market]]. Capitalism has also been called ''[[laissez-faire]] economy'', ''[[free market]] economy'', ''free enterprise system'', ''[[economic liberalism]]'', and ''economic individualism''.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>}}\n\n{{term|[[careerism]]}}\n{{defn|The desire to advance one's own [[career]] as a sole aim in life, often at the expense of personal and social growth or development.}}\n\n{{term|[[Cartesianism]]}}\n{{defn|A philosophy based on the ideas and works of the French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].}}\n\n{{term|[[Christian existential humanism]]}}\n{{defn|A philosophy that argues that humans can make choices based on {{gli|free will}} through [[Christianity|Christ's teachings]].}}\n\n{{term|[[Christian existentialism]]}}\n{{defn|The philosophical movement shares similar views to existentialism with the added idea that the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[God]] plays an important part in coping with the underlying themes of human existence.}}\n\n{{term|[[Christian humanism]]}}\n{{defn|A philosophy in which human freedom and individualism are compatible with the practice of [[Christianity]] or intrinsic in its doctrine.

With more than two billion adherents, or about one-third of the total world population, it is the largest world religion. Its origins are intertwined with [[Judaism]], with which it shares much sacred lore, including the [[Old Testament]] (Hebrew Bible). Christianity is sometimes termed an [[Abrahamic religion]], along with [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]].}}\n\n{{term|[[classical theism]]}}\n{{defn|Traditional ideas of the {{gli|monotheism|monotheistic}} religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Classical theism holds that God is an absolute, [[eternity|eternal]], all-knowing ([[omniscient]]), all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]), and perfect being. God is related to the world as its cause, but is unaffected by the world (immutable). He is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] over the world, which exists relative to him as a temporal effect.}}\n\n{{term|[[Classicism]]}}\n{{defn|In the [[arts]], a high regard for [[classical antiquity]], as setting standards for taste that the classicist seeks to emulate. Classicism is usually contrasted with {{gli|Romanticism}}; the art of classicism typically seeks to be formal, restrained, and [[Apollo]]nian (nothing in excess) rather than [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] (excessive), in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s opposition. It can also refer to the other periods of classicism. In [[theater]], '''Classicism''' was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theater]], including the [[Classical unities]] of time, place and action.}}\n\n{{term|[[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]}}\n{{defn|no=1|In {{gli|ethics}}, cognitivism is the philosophical view that ethical sentences express propositions, and hence are capable of being true or false. More generally, cognitivism with respect to any area of discourse is the position that sentences used in that discourse are cognitive, that is, are meaningful and capable of being true or false.}}\n{{defn|no=2|In [[psychology]], cognitivism is the approach to understanding the mind that argues that mental function can be understood as the 'internal' rule bound manipulation of symbols. See [[Cognitivism (psychology)]].}}\n\n{{term|[[coherentism]]}}\n{{defn|There are two distinct types of coherentism. One refers to the [[Truth#Coherence theory|coherence theory of truth]], which restricts true sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true {{gli|if and only if}} it is coherent with all or most of their other beliefs. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of [[Occam's razor]] are usually to be preferred. The second type of coherentism is the belief in the coherence [[theory of justification]], an {{gli|epistemology|epistemological}} theory opposing {{gli|foundationalism}} and offering a solution to the {{gli|regress argument}}. In this epistemological capacity, it is a theory about how {{gli|belief}} can be {{gli|theory of justification|justified}}.}}\n\n{{term|[[Colbertism]]}}\n{{defn|A variation of [[mercantilism]] which was applied in France between 1661 and 1683 by the superintendent of Finances [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]].}}\n\n{{term|[[collectivism]]}}\n{{defn|A theoretical or practical emphasis on the group, as opposed to (and seen by many of its opponents to be at the expense of) the individual. Some psychologists define collectivism as a syndrome of attitudes and behaviors based on the belief that the basic unit of survival lies within a group, not the individual. Collectivists typically hold that the \"greater good\" of the group, is more important than the good of any particular individual who is one part of that larger organization. Some collectivists argue that the individual ''incidentally'' serves his own interests by working for the benefit of the group.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>}}\n\n{{term|[[communalism]]}}\n{{defn|Outside of [[South Asia]], communalism involves a broad range of [[social movement]]s and [[social theories]] in some way centered upon the [[community]]. Communalism can take the form of communal living or communal property, among others. It is sometimes said to put the interests of the community above the interests of the individual, but this is usually only done on the principle that the community exists for the benefit of the individuals who participate in it, so the best way to serve the interests of the individual is through the interests of the community.}}\n\n{{term|[[Communism]]}}\n{{defn|A theoretical system of social organization and a political movement based on common ownership of the means of production. As a political movement, communism seeks to establish a classless society. A major force in world politics since the early 20th century, modern communism is generally associated with ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], according to which the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is replaced by a communist society in which the means of production are communally owned, such as through a [[gift economy]]. Often this process is said initiated by the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie (see Marxism), passes through a transitional period marked by the preparatory stage of socialism (see Leninism). Pure communism has never been implemented, it remains theoretical: communism is, in Marxist theory, the end-state, or the result of state-socialism. The word is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life under conditions of Communist party rule.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>}}\n\n{{term|[[Communitarianism]]}}\n{{defn|A group of related but distinct philosophies that began in the late 20th century, opposing aspects of liberalism and capitalism while advocating phenomena such as civil society. Not necessarily hostile to liberalism in the contemporary American sense of the word, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority (individual or community) often has the largest impact in the most pressing ethical questions: health care, abortion, multiculturalism, hate speech, and so on.}}\n\n{{term|[[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilism]]}}\n{{defn|Also known as \"soft determinism\" and championed by [[David Hume]], is a theory that holds that {{gli|free will}} and {{gli|determinism}} are compatible. According to Hume, free will should not be understood as an absolute ability to have chosen differently under exactly the same inner and outer circumstances. Rather, it is a hypothetical ability to have chosen differently if one had been differently psychologically disposed by some different beliefs or desires.

It differs from standard (empirical) {{gli|idealism}} in that it does not claim that the objects of human experience would be in any sense ''within'' the mind. The idea is that whenever humans experience something, they experience it as it is ''for themselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is, in a sense, altered by people's cognition (by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time).

The concept emerged in [[New England]] in the early-to mid-19th century. It is sometimes called \"''American'' ''Transcendentalism''\" to distinguish it from other uses of the word ''[[transcendentals|transcendental]]''.

The term ''transcendentalism'' sometimes serves as shorthand for \"[[transcendental idealism]]\". Another alternative meaning for ''transcendentalism'' is the classical philosophy that God transcends the manifest world.

In {{gli|metaphysics}}, accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause.

The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the ''world soul'', held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others.

[[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to God (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released for PlayStation 4 in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, code-named [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special [[livestream]] was announced titled ''Take Tokyo Tower'', which would coincide with the countdown date.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released for PlayStation 4 in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special [[livestream]] was announced titled ''Take Tokyo Tower'', which would coincide with the countdown date. During the Take Tokyo Tower livestream on that day, the release date for the game was revealed in a trailer shown during the livestream.

The costumes included those incorporated into the ''20th Anniversary Edition'' based on ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', in addition to new costumes based on the characters of ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'', the ''Persona 2'' duology (''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin|Innocent Sin]]'' and ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment|Eternal Punishment]]''), ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'', ''Catherine'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei IV]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army]]'', ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'', and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"P5blogDLC\"/><ref name=\"P5dlc2\"/><ref name=\"P5dlcWest\"/> The costumes were accompanied by arranged battle music from each costume set's respective game, which replaces the default battle theme based on what costume Joker wears.
