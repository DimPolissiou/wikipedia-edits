The Cathedral was completed and consecrated in 1866.  The [[Brotherhood of St Augustine of Hippo]] was established in the diocese a year later with Canon Beckett and seven members.  Together they built  the first Anglican church in [[Thaba Nchu]], completed in 1868.  This pioneering community established the Church\u2019s work in Thaba Nchu and in places as far apart as [[Wepener]] and [[Harrismith]] and continued faithfully from their house at [[Modderpoort]] until their work was taken over by the [[Society of the Sacred Mission]] in 1902.<ref name=\"eagle-i.co.za\"/>\n \nThe first Diocesan Synod met in 1872 and a good foundation was laid for the organizational side of the Church\u2019s work.  Two years later the need for Sisters for nursing, teaching and visiting was recognised and the [[Community of St Michael and All Angels]] was founded in Bloemfontein.  Furthermore, the Transvaal became no longer the responsibility of Bloemfontein when the [[Anglican Diocese of Pretoria]] was formed in 1878.  Then in 1891 the scope of the diocese again changed with the formation of the [[Anglican Diocese of Mashonaland]].<ref name=\"eagle-i.co.za\"/>\n  \nIn 1899, the year the Anglo Boer war broke out ([[Boer Wars]]), the diocesan bishop, Wale Hicks, died.

In a secret supplementary protocol, it was agreed (among other things) that the northern part of Bukovina would be annexed by the Soviet Union under a territorial re-organization in [[Eastern Europe]], with the German sub-populations undergoing compulsory resettlement. Under this accord, the Soviet Union occupied northern Romania in 1940. \n\nThe Third Reich resettled nearly the entire German population of Bukovina (about 96,000 ethnic Germans) to (among other places) occupied [[Poland]], where the incoming evacuees were frequently compensated with expropriated farms.\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Bukovina was entirely Romanian.

In 1945, the 7,500 or so remaining Germans in Bukovina were evacuated to Germany, ending (except for a very feeble number of individuals) a significant German presence in Bukovina, Romania after 1940.

In a secret supplementary protocol, it was agreed (among other things) that the northern part of Bukovina would be annexed by the Soviet Union under a territorial re-organization in [[Eastern Europe]], with the German sub-populations undergoing compulsory resettlement. Under this accord, the Soviet Union occupied northern Romania in 1940. \n\nThe Third Reich resettled nearly the entire German population of Bukovina (about 96,000 ethnic Germans) to (among other places) occupied [[Poland]], where the incoming evacuees were frequently compensated with expropriated farms.\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Bukovina was entirely Romanian.

In 1945, the 7,500 or so remaining Germans in Bukovina were evacuated to Germany, ending (except for a very feeble number of individuals) a significant German presence in Bukovina, Romania after 1940.

Another way this is expressed is to imagine that two worlds are constructed that differ only by parity \u2014 the \"real\" world and the \"mirror\" world, where left and right are swapped. If an interaction is parity symmetric, it produces the same outcomes in both \"worlds\".<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>\n\nThe aim of Wu's experiment was to determine if this was the case for the weak interaction by looking at whether the decay products of cobalt-60 were being emitted preferentially in one direction or not. This would signify the violation of parity symmetry because if the weak interaction were parity conserving, the decay emissions should be emitted with equal probability in all directions. As stated by Wu et al.:\n{{Quote|If an asymmetry in the distribution between \u03b8 and 180\u00b0\u2212\u03b8 (where \u03b8 is the angle between the orientation of the parent nuclei and the momentum of the electrons) is observed, it provides unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>}}\n\nThe reason for this is that the cobalt-60 nucleus carries [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and spin does not change direction under parity (because angular momentum is an [[axial vector]]). Conversely, the direction that the decay products are emitted ''is'' changed under parity because momentum is a [[polar vector]]. In other words, in the \"real\" world, if the cobalt-60 nuclear spin and the decay product emissions were both in roughly the same direction, then in the \"mirror\" world, they would be in roughly opposite directions, because the emission direction would have been flipped, but the spin direction would not.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/warwick_week/neutrino_physics/weak.pdf\n |title=The Weak Interaction\n |last=Boyd\n |first=Steve\n |date=2016-04-20\n |access-date=2019-12-08\n |website=Warwick University\n }}</ref>\n\nThis would be a clear difference in the behaviour of the weak interaction between both \"worlds\", and hence the weak interaction could not be said to be parity symmetric. The only way that the weak interaction could be parity symmetric is if there were no preference in the direction of emission, because then a flip in the direction of emissions in the \"mirror\" world would look no different than the \"real\" world because there were equal numbers of emissions in both directions anyway.\n\n== Experiment ==\nThe experiment monitored the decay of [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) atoms that were aligned by a uniform magnetic field (the polarizing field) and cooled to near [[absolute zero]] so that thermal motions did not ruin the alignment.<ref name=Wroblewski>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wroblewski |first=Andrzej K.\n |year=2008\n |title=The downfall of parity: The revolution that happened fifty years ago\n |journal=[[Acta Physica Polonica B]]\n |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=251\u2013264\n |bibcode=2008AcPPB..39..251W\n |url=https://inspirehep.net/record/807786/files/v39p0251.pdf\n}}</ref> Cobalt-60 is an [[unstable isotope|unstable]] [[isotopes of cobalt|isotope of cobalt]] that decays by [[beta decay]] to the stable isotope [[nickel-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Ni). During this decay, one of the [[neutron]]s in the cobalt-60 nucleus decays to a [[proton]] by emitting an [[electron]] (e<sup>&minus;</sup>) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{overline|&nu;}}<sub>e</sub>). The resulting nickel nucleus, however, is in an [[excited state]] and promptly decays to its ground state by emitting two [[gamma ray]]s (&gamma;). Hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:\n\n:<math>{}^{60}_{27}\\text{Co}  \\rightarrow  {}^{60}_{28}\\text{Ni} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e + 2{\\gamma}</math>\n\nGamma rays are photons, and their release from the nickel-60 nucleus is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] (EM) process. This is important because EM was known to respect parity conservation, and therefore they would be emitted roughly equally in all directions (they would be distributed roughly \"isotropically\"). Hence, the distribution of the emitted electrons could be compared to the distribution of the emitted gamma rays in order to compare whether they too were being emitted isotropically. In other words, the distribution of the gamma rays acted as a [[Scientific control|control]] for the distribution of the emitted electrons. Another benefit of the emitted gamma rays was that it was known that the degree to which they were ''not'' distributed perfectly equally in all directions (the \"anisotropy\" of their distribution) could be used to determine how well the cobalt-60 nuclei had been aligned (how well their [[Spin (physics)|spins]] were aligned).<ref name=Ambler>{{cite journal\n |last1=Ambler |first1=E.\n |last2=Grace |first2=M.

This is because an unaligned sample of nuclei could be expected to be orientated randomly, and thus the electron emissions would be random and the experiment would detect equal numbers of electron emissions in all directions, even if they were being emitted from each individual nucleus in only one direction.\n\nThe experiment then essentially counted the rate of emission for gamma rays and electrons in two distinct directions and compared their values. This rate was measured over time and with the polarizing field orientated in opposite directions. If the counting rates for the electrons did not differ significantly from those of the gamma rays, then there would have been evidence to suggest that parity was indeed conserved by the weak interaction. If, however, the counting rates were significantly different, then there would be strong evidence that the weak interaction does indeed violate parity conservation.\n\n===Materials and methods===\n[[File:Wu-Experiment (English).png|thumb|275px|Schematic illustration of the Wu experiment]]\nThe experimental challenge in this experiment was to obtain the highest possible polarization of the <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei. Due to the very small magnetic moments of the nuclei as compared to electrons, high magnetic fields were required at extremely low temperatures, far lower than could be achieved by liquid helium cooling alone. The low temperatures were achieved using the method of [[adiabatic demagnetization]]. Radioactive cobalt was deposited as a thin surface layer on a crystal of cerium-magnesium nitrate, a paramagnetic salt with a highly anisotropic [[Land\u00e9 g-factor]].\n\nThe salt was magnetized along the axis of high g-factor, and the temperature was lowered to 1.2&nbsp;K by pumping the helium to low pressure. Shutting off the horizontal magnetic field resulted in the temperature decreasing to about 0.003&nbsp;K. The horizontal magnet was opened up, allowing room for a vertical solenoid to be introduced and switched on to align the cobalt nuclei either upwards or downwards. Only a negligible increase in temperature was caused by the solenoid magnetic field, since the magnetic field orientation of the solenoid was in the direction of low g-factor. This method of achieving high polarization of <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei had been originated by Gorter<ref name=Gorter1948>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Gorter|first=C.

If parity were conserved in beta decay, the emitted electrons would have had no preferred direction of decay relative to the nuclear spin, and the asymmetry in emission direction would have been close to the value for the gamma rays. However, Wu observed that the electrons were emitted in a direction preferentially opposite to that of the gamma rays with an asymmetry significantly greater than the gamma ray anisotropy value. That is, most of the electrons favored a very specific direction of decay, specifically opposite to that of the nuclear spin.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/> The observed electron asymmetry also did not change sign when the polarizing field was reversed, meaning that the asymmetry was not being caused by [[remanent magnetization|remanence]] in the samples.

The right part of the particle simply does not feel the weak interaction.  If the down quark did not have mass it would not oscillate, and its right part would be quite stable by itself.

Another way this is expressed is to imagine that two worlds are constructed that differ only by parity \u2014 the \"real\" world and the \"mirror\" world, where left and right are swapped. If an interaction is parity symmetric, it produces the same outcomes in both \"worlds\".<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>\n\nThe aim of Wu's experiment was to determine if this was the case for the weak interaction by looking at whether the decay products of cobalt-60 were being emitted preferentially in one direction or not. This would signify the violation of parity symmetry because if the weak interaction were parity conserving, the decay emissions should be emitted with equal probability in all directions. As stated by Wu et al.:\n{{Quote|If an asymmetry in the distribution between \u03b8 and 180\u00b0\u2212\u03b8 (where \u03b8 is the angle between the orientation of the parent nuclei and the momentum of the electrons) is observed, it provides unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>}}\n\nThe reason for this is that the cobalt-60 nucleus carries [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and spin does not change direction under parity (because angular momentum is an [[axial vector]]). Conversely, the direction that the decay products are emitted ''is'' changed under parity because momentum is a [[polar vector]]. In other words, in the \"real\" world, if the cobalt-60 nuclear spin and the decay product emissions were both in roughly the same direction, then in the \"mirror\" world, they would be in roughly opposite directions, because the emission direction would have been flipped, but the spin direction would not.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/warwick_week/neutrino_physics/weak.pdf\n |title=The Weak Interaction\n |last=Boyd\n |first=Steve\n |date=2016-04-20\n |access-date=2019-12-08\n |website=Warwick University\n }}</ref>\n\nThis would be a clear difference in the behaviour of the weak interaction between both \"worlds\", and hence the weak interaction could not be said to be parity symmetric. The only way that the weak interaction could be parity symmetric is if there were no preference in the direction of emission, because then a flip in the direction of emissions in the \"mirror\" world would look no different than the \"real\" world because there were equal numbers of emissions in both directions anyway.\n\n== Experiment ==\nThe experiment monitored the decay of [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) atoms that were aligned by a uniform magnetic field (the polarizing field) and cooled to near [[absolute zero]] so that thermal motions did not ruin the alignment.<ref name=Wroblewski>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wroblewski |first=Andrzej K.\n |year=2008\n |title=The downfall of parity: The revolution that happened fifty years ago\n |journal=[[Acta Physica Polonica B]]\n |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=251\u2013264\n |bibcode=2008AcPPB..39..251W\n |url=https://inspirehep.net/record/807786/files/v39p0251.pdf\n}}</ref> Cobalt-60 is an [[unstable isotope|unstable]] [[isotopes of cobalt|isotope of cobalt]] that decays by [[beta decay]] to the stable isotope [[nickel-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Ni). During this decay, one of the [[neutron]]s in the cobalt-60 nucleus decays to a [[proton]] by emitting an [[electron]] (e<sup>&minus;</sup>) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{overline|&nu;}}<sub>e</sub>). The resulting nickel nucleus, however, is in an [[excited state]] and promptly decays to its ground state by emitting two [[gamma ray]]s (&gamma;). Hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:\n\n:<math>{}^{60}_{27}\\text{Co}  \\rightarrow  {}^{60}_{28}\\text{Ni} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e + 2{\\gamma}</math>\n\nGamma rays are photons, and their release from the nickel-60 nucleus is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] (EM) process. This is important because EM was known to respect parity conservation, and therefore they would be emitted roughly equally in all directions (they would be distributed roughly \"isotropically\"). Hence, the distribution of the emitted electrons could be compared to the distribution of the emitted gamma rays in order to compare whether they too were being emitted isotropically. In other words, the distribution of the gamma rays acted as a [[Scientific control|control]] for the distribution of the emitted electrons. Another benefit of the emitted gamma rays was that it was known that the degree to which they were ''not'' distributed perfectly equally in all directions (the \"anisotropy\" of their distribution) could be used to determine how well the cobalt-60 nuclei had been aligned (how well their [[Spin (physics)|spins]] were aligned).<ref name=Ambler>{{cite journal\n |last1=Ambler |first1=E.\n |last2=Grace |first2=M.

This is because an unaligned sample of nuclei could be expected to be orientated randomly, and thus the electron emissions would be random and the experiment would detect equal numbers of electron emissions in all directions, even if they were being emitted from each individual nucleus in only one direction.\n\nThe experiment then essentially counted the rate of emission for gamma rays and electrons in two distinct directions and compared their values. This rate was measured over time and with the polarizing field orientated in opposite directions. If the counting rates for the electrons did not differ significantly from those of the gamma rays, then there would have been evidence to suggest that parity was indeed conserved by the weak interaction. If, however, the counting rates were significantly different, then there would be strong evidence that the weak interaction does indeed violate parity conservation.\n\n===Materials and methods===\n[[File:Wu-Experiment (English).png|thumb|275px|Schematic illustration of the Wu experiment]]\nThe experimental challenge in this experiment was to obtain the highest possible polarization of the <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei. Due to the very small magnetic moments of the nuclei as compared to electrons, high magnetic fields were required at extremely low temperatures, far lower than could be achieved by liquid helium cooling alone. The low temperatures were achieved using the method of [[adiabatic demagnetization]]. Radioactive cobalt was deposited as a thin surface layer on a crystal of cerium-magnesium nitrate, a paramagnetic salt with a highly anisotropic [[Land\u00e9 g-factor]].\n\nThe salt was magnetized along the axis of high g-factor, and the temperature was lowered to 1.2&nbsp;K by pumping the helium to low pressure. Shutting off the horizontal magnetic field resulted in the temperature decreasing to about 0.003&nbsp;K. The horizontal magnet was opened up, allowing room for a vertical solenoid to be introduced and switched on to align the cobalt nuclei either upwards or downwards. Only a negligible increase in temperature was caused by the solenoid magnetic field, since the magnetic field orientation of the solenoid was in the direction of low g-factor. This method of achieving high polarization of <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei had been originated by Gorter<ref name=Gorter1948>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Gorter|first=C.

If parity were conserved in beta decay, the emitted electrons would have had no preferred direction of decay relative to the nuclear spin, and the asymmetry in emission direction would have been close to the value for the gamma rays. However, Wu observed that the electrons were emitted in a direction preferentially opposite to that of the gamma rays with an asymmetry significantly greater than the gamma ray anisotropy value. That is, most of the electrons favored a very specific direction of decay, specifically opposite to that of the nuclear spin.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/> The observed electron asymmetry also did not change sign when the polarizing field was reversed, meaning that the asymmetry was not being caused by [[remanent magnetization|remanence]] in the samples.

This is inherent in the nature of the weak interaction.  Previously, if the scientists on Earth were to communicate with a newly discovered planet's scientist, and they had never met in person, it would not have been possible for each group to determine unambiguously the other group's left and right.  With the Wu experiment, it is possible to communicate to the other group what the words left and right mean exactly and unambiguously.  The Wu experiment has finally solved the [[Ozma problem]] which is to give an unambiguous definition of left and right scientifically.<ref name=\"Gardner2005\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Gardner\n |first=M.\n |year=2005\n |title=The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings\n |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newambidextrousu00mart/page/215 215\u2013218]\n |edition=3rd Revised\n |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]]\n |isbn=978-0-486-44244-0\n |url-access=registration\n |url=https://archive.org/details/newambidextrousu00mart/page/215\n }}</ref>\n \nAt the [[fundamental particle|fundamental]] level (as depicted in the [[Feynman diagram]] on the right), Beta decay is caused by the conversion of the negatively charged ({{nowrap|\u2212{{sfrac|1|3}} [[elementary charge|e]]}}) [[down quark]] to the positively charged ({{nowrap|+{{sfrac|2|3}} e}}) [[up quark]] by emission of a [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]]; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino:\n:{{Subatomic particle|down quark}} \u2192 {{Subatomic particle|up quark}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}.\n\nThe quark has a [[Chirality (physics)|left]] part and a [[Chirality (physics)|right]] part.  As it walks across the spacetime, it oscillates back and forth from right part to left part and from left part to right part.  From analyzing the Wu experiment's demonstration of parity violation, it can be deduced that only the left part of down quarks decay and the weak interaction involves only the left part of quarks and leptons (or the right part of antiquarks and antileptons).  The right part of the particle simply does not feel the weak interaction.  If the down quark did not have mass it would not oscillate, and its right part would be quite stable by itself.  Yet, because the down quark is massive, it oscillates and decays.<ref name=\"LedermanHill2013\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Lederman |first1=L. M.\n |last2=Hill |first2=C.

{"title_page": "United States presidential approval rating", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\nIn the '''United States, presidential job approval ratings''' were introduced by [[George Gallup]] in the late 1930s (estimated to be 1937) to gauge public support for the [[president of the United States]] during their term. An approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a [[politician]] based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure.

An approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a [[politician]] based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure.

Many unscientific approval rating systems exist that show inaccurate statistics. Examples that self select, such as online questions are of this type. However, the aggregate approval rating is generally accepted by statisticians, as a statistically valid indicator of the comparative changes in the popular United States mood regarding a president. \n\nPresident Donald Trump in 2018 had a job approval of approximately 75 to 90 percent among Republicans and 5 to 10 percent among Democrats.<ref name=\"Donald Trump Gallup Polling Data\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx|title=Presidential Approval Ratings \u2013 Donald Trump|work=Gallup|accessdate=February 13, 2017}} </ref> Gallup polling has found that, as of 2019, 47% of Americans are either \"Democrats or Democratic leaners\" while 42% are either \"Republicans or Republican leaners\".<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Party Preferences Steady During Trump Era|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/274694/party-preferences-steady-during-trump-era.aspx|work=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|author=Jeffrey M.
