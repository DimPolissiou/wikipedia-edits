In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by centrifugation of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).\n\nProkaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are, like eukaryotic DNA, generally [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled]]. The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], regulation, and [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n== Eukaryotes ==\n[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|280px|Organization of DNA in a eukaryotic cell]]\n{{See also|Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure}}\n\nChromosomes in eukaryotes are composed of [[chromatin]] fiber. Chromatin fiber is made of [[nucleosome]]s ([[histone octamer]]s with part of a DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it). Chromatin fibers are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called [[chromatin]]. Chromatin contains the vast majority of DNA, but a [[Mitochondrial DNA|small amount]] inherited maternally, can be found in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Chromatin is present in most [[Cell (biology)|cells]], with a few exceptions, for example, [[red blood cell]]s.\n\nChromatin allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the [[cell nucleus]]. During cell division chromatin condenses further to form microscopically visible chromosomes. The structure of chromosomes varies through the [[cell cycle]]. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their [[offspring|progeny]]. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called [[chromatids]] or [[sister chromatids]]) joined by a [[centromere]].\n\n[[File:Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|center|850px|The major structures in DNA compaction: [[DNA]], the [[nucleosome]], the 10&nbsp;nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre, the 30&nbsp;nm fibre and the [[metaphase]] chromosome.]]\n[[Eukaryotes]] ([[cell (biology)|cells]] with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [[centromere]], with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[Mitochondrial DNA|genome]], and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [[cytoplasm]]ic chromosomes.\n\nIn the nuclear chromosomes of [[eukaryote]]s, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [[histone]]s (structural [[protein]]s), forming a composite material called [[chromatin]].\n\n=== Interphase chromatin ===\nDuring [[interphase]] (the period of the [[cell cycle]] where the cell is not dividing), two types of [[chromatin]] can be distinguished:\n* [[Euchromatin]], which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein.\n* [[Heterochromatin]], which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types:\n** ''Constitutive heterochromatin'', which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].\n** ''Facultative heterochromatin'', which is sometimes expressed.\n\n=== Metaphase chromatin and division ===\n{{see also|mitosis|meiosis}}\n<!-- too many pictures! [[File:ChickenChromosomesBMC Genomics5-56Fig4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chicken chromosomes during [[metaphase]], with highlighted [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]]] -->\n[[File:HumanChromosomesChromomycinA3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Human chromosomes during [[metaphase]]]]\nIn the early stages of [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]] (cell division), the chromatin double helix become more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister [[chromatids]] attached to each other at the [[centromere]]. The shorter arms are called ''p arms'' (from the [[French language|French]] ''petit'', small) and the longer arms are called ''q arms'' (''q'' follows ''p'' in the Latin alphabet; q-g \"grande\"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for ''queue'' meaning tail in French<ref>\"[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/chromosome-mapping-idiograms-302 Chromosome Mapping: Idiograms]\" ''Nature Education'' \u2013 August 13, 2013</ref>). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [[microscope]].\n\nMitotic metaphase chromosomes are best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.<ref name=\"pmid24200812\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Naumova N, Imakaev M, Fudenberg G, Zhan Y, Lajoie BR, Mirny LA, Dekker J | title = Organization of the mitotic chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6161 | pages = 948\u201353 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24200812 | pmc = 4040465 | doi = 10.1126/science.1236083 | bibcode = 2013Sci...342..948N }}</ref>\n\nDuring mitosis, [[microtubule]]s grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called [[kinetochores]], one of which is present on each sister [[chromatid]]. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.\n\n=== Human chromosomes ===\nChromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: [[autosome]]s (body chromosome(s)) and allosome ([[sex chromosome]](s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [[mitochondrial genome]]. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [[Sanger Institute]]'s human genome information in the [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database]].<ref>[http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html Vega.sanger.ad.uk], all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008.</ref> Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on [[gene prediction]]s.

[[Gamete]]s, reproductive cells, are [[haploid]] [n]: They have one set of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by [[meiosis]] of a diploid [[germ line]] cell.

When a male and a female gamete merge ([[fertilization]]), a new diploid organism is formed.\n\nSome animal and plant species are [[polyploid]] [Xn]: They have more than two sets of [[homologous chromosome]]s. Plants important in agriculture such as [[tobacco]] or [[wheat]] are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some [[cultivar]]s as well as the wild progenitors.

There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.\nIn some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:\n:1. variation between the two sexes\n:2. variation between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma (biology)|soma]] (between [[gamete]]s and the rest of the body)\n:3. variation between members of a population, due to [[polymorphism (biology)|balanced genetic polymorphism]]\n:4.

[[mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.\nAlso, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilized egg.\n\nThe technique of determining the karyotype is usually called ''karyotyping''. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [[in vitro]] (in a reaction vial) with [[colchicine]]. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a ''karyogram'', with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end.\n\nLike many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [[XY sex-determination system|gonosomes]] (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [[autosome]]s).

The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], regulation, and [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n== Eukaryotes ==\n[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|280px|Organization of DNA in a eukaryotic cell]]\n{{See also|Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure}}\n\nChromosomes in eukaryotes are composed of [[chromatin]] fiber. Chromatin fiber is made of [[nucleosome]]s ([[histone octamer]]s with part of a DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it). Chromatin fibers are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called [[chromatin]]. Chromatin contains the vast majority of DNA, but a [[Mitochondrial DNA|small amount]] inherited maternally, can be found in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Chromatin is present in most [[Cell (biology)|cells]], with a few exceptions, for example, [[red blood cell]]s.\n\nChromatin allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the [[cell nucleus]]. During cell division chromatin condenses further to form microscopically visible chromosomes. The structure of chromosomes varies through the [[cell cycle]]. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their [[offspring|progeny]]. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called [[chromatids]] or [[sister chromatids]]) joined by a [[centromere]].\n\n[[File:Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|center|850px|The major structures in DNA compaction: [[DNA]], the [[nucleosome]], the 10&nbsp;nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre, the 30&nbsp;nm fibre and the [[metaphase]] chromosome.]]\n[[Eukaryotes]] ([[cell (biology)|cells]] with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [[centromere]], with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[Mitochondrial DNA|genome]], and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [[cytoplasm]]ic chromosomes.\n\nIn the nuclear chromosomes of [[eukaryote]]s, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [[histone]]s (structural [[protein]]s), forming a composite material called [[chromatin]].\n\n=== Interphase chromatin ===\nDuring [[interphase]] (the period of the [[cell cycle]] where the cell is not dividing), two types of [[chromatin]] can be distinguished:\n* [[Euchromatin]], which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein.\n* [[Heterochromatin]], which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types:\n** ''Constitutive heterochromatin'', which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].\n** ''Facultative heterochromatin'', which is sometimes expressed.\n\n=== Metaphase chromatin and division ===\n{{see also|mitosis|meiosis}}\n<!-- too many pictures!

They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister [[chromatids]] attached to each other at the [[centromere]]. The shorter arms are called ''p arms'' (from the [[French language|French]] ''petit'', small) and the longer arms are called ''q arms'' (''q'' follows ''p'' in the Latin alphabet; q-g \"grande\"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for ''queue'' meaning tail in French<ref>\"[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/chromosome-mapping-idiograms-302 Chromosome Mapping: Idiograms]\" ''Nature Education'' \u2013 August 13, 2013</ref>). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [[microscope]].\n\nMitotic metaphase chromosomes are best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.<ref name=\"pmid24200812\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Naumova N, Imakaev M, Fudenberg G, Zhan Y, Lajoie BR, Mirny LA, Dekker J | title = Organization of the mitotic chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6161 | pages = 948\u201353 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24200812 | pmc = 4040465 | doi = 10.1126/science.1236083 | bibcode = 2013Sci...342..948N }}</ref>\n\nDuring mitosis, [[microtubule]]s grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called [[kinetochores]], one of which is present on each sister [[chromatid]]. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.\n\n=== Human chromosomes ===\nChromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: [[autosome]]s (body chromosome(s)) and allosome ([[sex chromosome]](s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [[mitochondrial genome]]. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [[Sanger Institute]]'s human genome information in the [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database]].<ref>[http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html Vega.sanger.ad.uk], all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008.</ref> Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on [[gene prediction]]s. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced [[heterochromatin]] regions.\n\n[[File:Genes and base pairs on chromosomes.svg|frame|Estimated number of genes and base pairs (in millions) on each human chromosome]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+\n|-\n!

There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.\nIn some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:\n:1. variation between the two sexes\n:2. variation between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma (biology)|soma]] (between [[gamete]]s and the rest of the body)\n:3. variation between members of a population, due to [[polymorphism (biology)|balanced genetic polymorphism]]\n:4. [[allopatric speciation|geographical variation]] between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]\n:5. [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.\nAlso, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilized egg.\n\nThe technique of determining the karyotype is usually called ''karyotyping''. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [[in vitro]] (in a reaction vial) with [[colchicine]]. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a ''karyogram'', with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end.\n\nLike many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [[XY sex-determination system|gonosomes]] (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [[autosome]]s).

Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [[translocations]], or [[chromosomal inversions]], although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing a child with a chromosome disorder.

Human examples include:\n* [[Cri du chat]], which is caused by the [[Genetic deletion|deletion]] of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. \"Cri du chat\" means \"cry of the cat\" in French; the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health problems, and are very short.\n* [[Down syndrome]], the most common trisomy, usually caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([[trisomy 21]]). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes and mild to moderate developmental disability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Kenneth R. | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biology|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|date=2000|edition=5th |pages=194\u20135|chapter=Chapter 9-3|isbn=978-0-13-436265-6}}</ref>\n* [[Edwards syndrome]], or trisomy-18, the second most common trisomy.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Trisomy 18?|url=http://www.trisomy18.org/what-is-trisomy-18/|website=Trisomy 18 Foundation|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems.

Most have a bleeding disorder called [[Paris-Trousseau syndrome]].\n* [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile and tend to be taller and have longer arms and legs than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet and have a higher incidence of [[speech delay]] and [[dyslexia]]. Without testosterone treatment, some may develop [[gynecomastia]] during puberty.\n* [[Patau Syndrome]], also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, without the characteristic folded hand.\n* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister\u2013Killian syndrome]].\n* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin and have a higher incidence of dyslexia.\n* [[Turner syndrome]] (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. Females with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development and a \"caved-in\" appearance to the chest.\n* [[Wolf\u2013Hirschhorn syndrome]], which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by growth retardation, delayed motor skills development, \"Greek Helmet\" facial features, and mild to profound mental health problems.\n* [[XYY syndrome]]. XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings.

The album is the band's most successful record since 1998's [[Against (Sepultura album)|Against]], charting on 17 countries and entering the top 20 on 7 countries (8, considering the UK Rock Charts), and their first number one album (Brazil). It is also their most successful album in Germany and Switzerland to date, exceeding even the chart positions from [[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]] with positions #5 and #13, respectively.  As it was with [[Machine Messiah (album)|''Machine Messiah'']], the band went to [[Sweden]] to work with producer [[Jens Bogren]] for the recording of ''Quadra''.\n\n==Concept==\nGuitarist [[Andreas Kisser]] explained that the concept of the album is based on Quadrivium, which are the four subjects, or arts (namely arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy), taught after teaching the trivium. The word is Latin, meaning four ways.\n\nBased on this, the band divided the 12-track album into four sections of three songs each. The first being [[thrash metal]] songs, based on the classic Sepultura sound. The second section is inspired by the [[Groove Metal|groove]]-[[percussion]] oriented sound the band explored in [[Roots (Sepultura album)|''Roots'']]. The third part has more progressive songs inspired by the track \"Iceberg Dances\" from ''Machine Messiah'', but is not all instrumental tracks. Side four features slow-paced and melodic tracks, similar to the song Machine Messiah.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/winlWGWOqyc|title=SEPULTURA - Derrick & Andreas on division of album + working with Jens Bogren (OFFICIAL TRAILER)|website=[[YouTube.com]]|date=January 9, 2020|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nQuadra is also the Portuguese term for sports court.

The album is the band's most successful record since 1998's [[Against (Sepultura album)|Against]], charting on 17 countries and entering the top 20 on 7 countries (8, considering the UK Rock Charts), and their first number one album (Brazil). It is also their most successful album in Germany and Switzerland to date, exceeding even the chart positions from [[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]] with positions #5 and #13, respectively.  As it was with [[Machine Messiah (album)|''Machine Messiah'']], the band went to [[Sweden]] to work with producer [[Jens Bogren]] for the recording of ''Quadra''.\n\n==Concept==\nGuitarist [[Andreas Kisser]] explained that the concept of the album is based on Quadrivium, which are the four subjects, or arts (namely arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy), taught after teaching the trivium. The word is Latin, meaning four ways.\n\nBased on this, the band divided the 12-track album into four sections of three songs each. The first being [[thrash metal]] songs, based on the classic Sepultura sound. The second section is inspired by the [[Groove Metal|groove]]-[[percussion]] oriented sound the band explored in [[Roots (Sepultura album)|''Roots'']]. The third part has more progressive songs inspired by the track \"Iceberg Dances\" from ''Machine Messiah'', but is not all instrumental tracks. Side four features slow-paced and melodic tracks, similar to the song Machine Messiah.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/winlWGWOqyc|title=SEPULTURA - Derrick & Andreas on division of album + working with Jens Bogren (OFFICIAL TRAILER)|website=[[YouTube.com]]|date=January 9, 2020|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nQuadra is also the Portuguese term for sports court. Kisser stated that \"everyone grows up in a different Quadra, shaped by rules and definitions. We are all determined by these concepts, our relationships, our careers. Our whole lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/6362206.71112.sepultura-start-pre-order-for-quot-quadra-quot.html|title=SEPULTURA- start pre-order for \"Quadra\"!|website=[[Nuclearblast.de]]|date=November 21, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Derrick Green]] was asked during an interview with [[BraveWords]] \"Which Sepultura album are you most proud of?\", he replied, \"Definitely ''Quadra''. It's the latest album, and we really worked so hard on it. We have so many different elements from the past that have helped us get to here \u2013 where we are at right now.

Brady Press Briefing Room]]. The room currently seats 49 reporters. Each seat is assigned to a news gathering organization, with the most prominent organizations occupying the first two rows. Reporters who do not have an assigned seat may stand. Often a smaller group of reporters known as the \"White House press pool\" is assembled to report back to their colleagues on events where the venue would make open coverage logistically difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhen a new U.S. president is elected, some news organizations change their correspondents, most often to the reporter who had been assigned to cover the new president during the preceding campaign. For example, after the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], ABC News moved [[Jake Tapper]], who had covered [[Barack Obama]] during his presidential campaign, to the White House correspondent's position.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe White House press corps had their first duties in the White House in the early 1900s. An [[urban legend]] exists of [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whca.net/history.htm | title = HISTORY OF THE WHCA | work = WHCA | publisher = White House Correspondents' Association  | date = }}</ref>\n\n==Correspondents==\n\n===Current===\n\nOrdered by [[James S.

Their offices are located in the [[West Wing]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and Mrs. Monika Babi\u0161ov\u00e1 Visit the White House (40353221263).jpg|thumb|Photographers and videographers in the [[Oval Office]] in 2019]]\n[[File:White House Press Corp outside.jpg|thumb|Semi-permanent setup of press corps on the west end of the north White House lawn, from where live media broadcasts with the White House are typically delivered]]\nThe [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] or a deputy generally holds a weekday news briefing in the [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]]. The room currently seats 49 reporters. Each seat is assigned to a news gathering organization, with the most prominent organizations occupying the first two rows. Reporters who do not have an assigned seat may stand. Often a smaller group of reporters known as the \"White House press pool\" is assembled to report back to their colleagues on events where the venue would make open coverage logistically difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhen a new U.S. president is elected, some news organizations change their correspondents, most often to the reporter who had been assigned to cover the new president during the preceding campaign. For example, after the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], ABC News moved [[Jake Tapper]], who had covered [[Barack Obama]] during his presidential campaign, to the White House correspondent's position.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe White House press corps had their first duties in the White House in the early 1900s. An [[urban legend]] exists of [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whca.net/history.htm | title = HISTORY OF THE WHCA | work = WHCA | publisher = White House Correspondents' Association  | date = }}</ref>\n\n==Correspondents==\n\n===Current===\n\nOrdered by [[James S.

({{ko-hhrm|\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300-\ud0dc\ud2f0\uc11c}}, also known as '''TTS''', '''TaeTiSeo''', or '''Girls' Generation-TaeTiSeo''') is the first sub-unit of South Korean girl group [[Girls' Generation]], formed by [[SM Entertainment]] in 2012. It is composed of three Girls' Generation members: [[Kim Tae-yeon|Taeyeon]], [[Tiffany Young|Tiffany]], and [[Seohyun]]. The sub-group has released three extended plays: ''[[Twinkle (EP)|Twinkle]]'', ''[[Holler (EP)|Holler]]'', and ''[[Dear Santa (EP)|Dear Santa]]''.\n\n==History==\nDuring the year 2012, South Korean girl group [[Girls' Generation]] went through an unannounced hiatus as the majority of the group's members were focusing on individual activities. Some acted in television dramas while others participated in various television programs. The subgroup TTS was born because members Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Seohyun wanted to carry on with their music activities. All three were hosts of the weekly music program ''[[Show!
