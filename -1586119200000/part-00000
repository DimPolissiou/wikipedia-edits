Pooling their research, [[historians]], [[linguists]] and [[anthropologists]] have concluded the Assiniboine broke away from the Lakota and Dakota Sioux bands in the 17th century.\n[[File:Tribal treaty territories in Montana - a general view.png|thumb|Early tribal treaty territories in Montana]]\n\nThe [[Gros Ventre]] are located today in north-central [[Montana]] and govern the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]].  ''Gros Ventre'' is the [[exonym]] given by the French, who misinterpreted the name given to them by neighboring tribes as \"the people who have enough to eat\", referring to their relative wealth, as \"big bellies\".  The people call themselves (autonym) ''A'ani'' or ''A'aninin'' (white clay people), perhaps related to natural physical formations. They were called the ''Atsina'' by the Assiniboine. The A'ani have 3,682 members and they share [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] with the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], though the two were traditional enemies. The A'ani are classified as a band of [[Arapaho]]; they speak a variant of Arapaho  called ''Gros Ventre'' or ''Atsina''.\n\nThe [[Ktunaxa|Kootenai]] people live west of the Continental Divide. The Kootenai name is also spelled ''Kutenai'' or ''Ktunaxa'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|e\u026a}}. They are one of three tribes of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation]] in [[Montana]], and they form the Ktunaxa Nation in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. There are also Kootenai populations in [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The [[Bitterroot Salish (tribe)|Salish]] and [[Pend d'Oreilles (tribe)|Pend d'Oreilles]] people also live on the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]].

Rocky Boy's reservation was created after most of the others as a home for some of the \"landless\" tribes who did not obtain reservation lands elsewhere. The creation of the reservation was largely due to the efforts of the Chippewa leader Stone Child (aka \"Rocky Boy\"). The [[Little Shell Chippewa]] also have a presence in Montana, however they do not have a reservation.\n\nOther native people had a significant presence in Montana, though today do not have a reservation within the state.

Through interactions with [[Iroquois]] between 1812 and 1820, the [[Bitterroot Salish|Salish]] people learned about Christianity and the [[Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] (known as \"blackrobes\"), who worked with Native tribes teaching about agriculture, medicine, and religion. Interest in these \"blackrobes\" grew among the Salish. In 1831, four young Salish men were dispatched to St. Louis, Missouri to request a \"blackrobe\" to return with them to their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley. The four Salish men were directed to the home and office of [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] (of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark fame]]) to make their request. At that time Clark was in charge of administering the territory they called home. Through the perils of their trip, two died at the home of General Clark.

It was named in honor of Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], who encouraged settlement of the West. The U.S. Army took over the commercial fort in 1869 and a detachment of the 7th Infantry remained in the town until 1881.  Its location on the Missouri River marked the farthest practical point upriver that steamboats could navigate. With the arrival of the first steamboats in 1860, the town of Fort Benton began to develop outside the fort's walls and developed into a major trading center over the next 27 years, until it was supplanted with the arrival of railroads in the Montana Territory.  An original blockhouse still remaining in the largely reconstructed fort is the oldest building in Montana still on its original foundations, giving rise to the town's reputation as \"the birthplace of Montana\".\n\n===Fort Ellis===\nBuilt near the mouth of the Gallatin Valley, [[Fort Ellis]] played an important role in many of the early Indian conflicts in the territory. Elements of the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry]] stationed here took part in both the [[Marias Massacre]] and the [[Great Sioux War of 1876-77#The summer expeditions|Great Sioux War of 1876-77]]. It also provided a staging location for many missions of exploration and survey into the region that became [[Yellowstone National Park]].\n\n===Fort Shaw===\n[[Fort Shaw, Montana|Fort Shaw]] was established in the spring of 1867 located west of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] in the Sun River Valley. Two posts built at the time were [[Camp Cooke (Montana)|Camp Cooke]] on the [[Judith River]] and [[Fort C. F. Smith (Fort Smith, Montana)|Fort C.F. Smith]] on the [[Bozeman Trail]] in south central Montana Territory. Fort Shaw was built of adobe and lumber by the 13th Infantry. The fort had a parade ground that was 400 feet (120 m) square, and consisted of barracks for officers, a hospital, and a trading post, and could house up to 450 soldiers. The soldiers mainly guarded the Benton-Helena Road, the major supply-line from [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]], which was the head of navigation on the [[Missouri River]], to the gold mining districts in southwestern Montana Territory. The fort was decommissioned in 1891. The following year, 1892, the 20 buildings on the site were adapted for the Fort Shaw Indian Industrial School. The school boarded young Native people to assimilate them, teach them English, and educate them in modern technology; it had as many as 17 faculty members, 11 Native assistants, and 300 students.\n<!--Add: Fort Keough, Fort Ellis, Fort Harrison, Malmstron AFB, etc.-->\n\n==Montana Territory==\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Montana Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:NMA.0039209 Emigration.

It occurred June 25\u2013June 26, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in eastern Montana Territory near present-day [[Hardin, Montana]], on land that today is part of the [[Crow Indian Reservation]].<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs.

Only two men from the 7th Cavalry later claimed to have seen the battle: a young Crow whose name translated as [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], and a trooper named [[Peter Thompson (soldier)|Peter Thompson]], who had fallen behind Custer's column, and most accounts of the last moments of Custer's forces are conjecture. Lakota accounts assert that [[Crazy Horse]] personally led one of the large groups of Lakota who overwhelmed the cavalry. While exact numbers are difficult to determine, it is commonly estimated that the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota outnumbered the 7th Cavalry by approximately 3:1, a ratio that was extended to 5:1 during the fragmented parts of the battle.\n\nLater, the [[Lakota people|Sioux]] were defeated in a series of subsequent battles by the reinforced U.S. Army who continued attacking even in the winter, and most were forced to move onto reservations, mostly outside of Montana, primarily by tactics such as preventing buffalo hunts and enforcing government food-distribution policies to \"friendlies\" only. The Lakota were compelled to sign a treaty in 1877 ceding the [[Black Hills]] to the United States, but a low-intensity war continued, culminating, fourteen years later, in the killing of [[Sitting Bull]] (December 15, 1890) at [[Standing Rock]] and the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] (December 29, 1890) at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]].\n\n===Northern Cheyenne exodus===\n[[File:Cheyenne using travois.jpg|thumb|Stump Horn and family (Northern Cheyenne); showing home and horse-drawn travois.]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], attempts by the U.S. Army to capture the Cheyenne intensified. A group of 972 Cheyenne was escorted to [[Indian Territory]] in Oklahoma in 1877. The government intended to re-unite the Northern and Southern Cheyenne into one nation. There the conditions were dire; the Northern Cheyenne were not used to the climate and soon many became ill with [[malaria]]. In addition, the food rations were insufficient and of poor quality. In 1878, the two principal Chiefs, [[Little Wolf]] and Morning Star ([[Dull Knife]]) pressed for the release of the Cheyenne so they could travel back north. However, they were denied permission, so that same year the two men led a group of 353 Northern Cheyenne who left Indian Territory to travel back north. The Army and other civilian volunteers were in hot pursuit of the Cheyenne as they traveled north. It is estimated that a total of 13,000 Army soldiers and volunteers were sent to pursue the Cheyenne over the whole course of their journey north.\n\nAfter crossing into Nebraska, the group split into two. One group was led by [[Little Wolf]], and the other by Dull Knife. Little Wolf and his band made it back to [[Montana]]. Dull Knife and his band were captured and escorted to [[Fort Robinson]], [[Nebraska]] and sequestered. They were ordered to return to Oklahoma but they refused. Conditions at the fort grew tense through the end of 1878 and soon the Cheyenne were confined to barracks with no food, water, or heat. In January 1879, Dull Knife and his group broke out of Ft. Robinson. Much of the group was gunned down as they ran away from the fort, and others were discovered near the fort during the following days and ordered to surrender but most of the escapees chose to fight because they would rather be killed than taken back into custody. It is estimated that only 50 survived the breakout, including Dull Knife. Several of the escapees later had to stand trial for the murders that had been committed in Kansas. The remains of those killed were repatriated in 1994.\n\nUltimately, the military gave up attempting to relocate the Northern Cheyenne in Oklahoma. The persistence of the Northern Cheyenne resulted in the creation of the Northern Cheyenne reservation in Montana.<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904, pp. 594\u2013596.</ref>\n\n===The flight of the Nez Perce===\n[[File:ChiefJoseph.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Chief Joseph]]\nThe [[Nez Perce people]] were settled what today is Washington and Oregon, though made hunting forays into western Montana. However, in 1877 pressure from white settlers led to several incidents of violence and a significant number of the Nez Perce were forced from their home region and fled rather than submit to being moved to a reservation. With 2000 U.S. soldiers in pursuit, 800 Nez Perce spent over three months outmaneuvering and battling their pursuers, led by General Howard. They traveled {{convert|1700|mi|km}} across Oregon, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], Idaho, [[Yellowstone National Park]], and [[Montana]]. In the process, they held off the Army at the [[Battle of the Big Hole]] in southwestern Montana, dropped into Yellowstone Park, then traveled into east-central Montana where they attempted to ally with both the Crow and the Arapaho, but were rebuffed due to tensions surrounding the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. They then turned north, attempting to reach Canada.\n\nGeneral Howard, leading the United States cavalry, was impressed with the skill with which the Nez Perce fought, using advance and rear guards, skirmish lines, and field fortifications. However, unbeknownst to the Nez Perce, a force led by [[Nelson A. Miles]] was dispatched from eastern Montana on a quick march to intercept them, which occurred less than {{convert|40|mi}} south of Canada in the [[Bear Paw Mountains]], not far from present-day [[Chinook, Montana|Chinook]] in [[Blaine County, Montana|Blaine County]]. Finally, after a devastating five-day battle during freezing weather conditions with no food or blankets, having lost the major war leaders, Chief Joseph formally [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]] to General  Miles on October 5, 1877.\n\n===Louis Riel and the Metis===\nSome [[M\u00e9tis]] from the British territory to the north settled in Montana in the latter half of the 19th century. For a time, [[Louis Riel]], the M\u00e9tis leader from Manitoba in exile, taught school at [[St. Peter's Mission Church and Cemetery|St. Peter's Mission]] in Montana and was active in the local Republican Party. Democrats alleged he helped M\u00e9tis men, who were not American citizens, to vote for the Republicans. In the summer of 1884, a delegation of M\u00e9tis leaders including [[Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] and [[James Isbister]], convinced Riel to return north, where in the following year he led the M\u00e9tis revolt against Canadian rule, known as the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Following the defeat of the M\u00e9tis rebels and the imprisonment and later hanging to Riel, Gabriel Dumont fled to exile in Montana.\n\n==Railroads==\nThe railroads were the engine of settlement in the state. Major development occurred in the 1880s. The [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] was given land grants by the federal government so that it could borrow money to build its system, reaching [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] in 1882. The federal government kept every other section of land, and gave it away to homesteaders. At first the railroad sold much of its holdings at low prices to land speculators in order to realize quick cash profits, and also to eliminate sizable annual tax bills. The speculators in turn parceled out the land on credit to farmers and ranchers eager to develop operations near a railroad. By 1905 the company changed its land policies as it realize it had been a costly mistake to have sold so much land at wholesale prices. With better railroad service and improved methods of farming the Northern Pacific easily sold what had been heretofore \"worthless\" land directly to farmers at good prices. By 1910 the railroad's holdings in North Dakota had been greatly reduced.<ref>Ross R. Controneo, \"Northern Pacific Officials and the Disposition of the Railroad's Land Grant in North Dakota after 1888\", ''North Dakota History'', 1970, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}77\u2013103</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]] energetically promoted settlement along its lines in the northern part of the state. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government\u2014it received no land grants\u2014and resold them to farmers one by one. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost.<ref>David H.

In 1907-09 Taft served as a boisterous construction town for the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad. The camp included many ethnic groups, numerous saloons and prostitutes, and substantial violence. When construction was finished, the camp was abandoned.<ref>Virginia Weisel Johnson, \"Tough Taft: Boom Town\".

Built in symmetrical fashion along both sides of the track, the city grew to 7,000 by 1914. Several structures built between 1883 and 1914 still exist and provide a physical record of the era and indicate the city's role as a rail and tourist center. The Northern Pacific depot reflects the desire to impress the tourists who disembarked here for Yellowstone Park, and the railroad's machine shops reveal the city's industrial history.<ref>\"Livingston: Railroad Town on the Yellowstone\", ''Montana''  Dec 1985, Vol. 35 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}84\u201386</ref>\n\n==Women==\n<!--seems a little undue, may also want to more on ethnicity of early settlers (German, Irish, Scandavian, etc.) in this general part of the article)-->\nIn Montana, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details.<ref>Laurie K.

Montana women, especially \"society women\", did not strongly support the suffragists. However, help from national leaders and the efforts of Montana supporters of suffrage such as [[Jeannette Rankin]] (1880\u20131973), led to success in 1914 when voters ratified a suffrage amendment passed by the legislature in 1913. In 1916, Rankin, a Republican, became the first woman ever elected to Congress. She was elected again in 1940. Rankin was a peace activist, who voted against American entry into both World War I and World War II.<ref>James J. Lopach, and Jean A. Luckowski. ''Jeannette Rankin: a political woman'' (2005)</ref>\n\nThe status of women in the 19th-century West has drawn the attention of numerous scholars, whose interpretations fall into three types: 1) the Frontier school influenced by [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], which argues that the West was a liberating experience for women and men; 2) the reactionists, who view the West as a place of drudgery for women, who reacted unfavorably to the isolation and difficult work environment in the West; and 3) those writers who claim the West had no distinctive effect on women's lives, that it was a static, neutral frontier. Cole (1990) uses legal records  to argue that the Turner thesis best explains the improvement in women's status in Montana and the early achievement of suffrage.<ref>Judith K. Cole, \"A Wide Field for Usefulness: Women'S  Civil Status and the Evolution of Women's  Suffrage on The Montana Frontier, 1864\u20131914\", ''American Journal of Legal History'', July 1990, Vol. 34 Issue 3, pp.{{nbsp}}262\u2013294</ref>\n\nWomen's clubs expressed the interests, needs, and beliefs of middle-class women around the start of the 20th century. While accepting the domestic role established by the [[cult of domesticity]], their reformist activities reveal a persistent demand for self-expression outside the home. Homesteading was a significant experience for altering women's perceptions of their roles. They expressed their aesthetic interests in gardens and organized social activities. Though these clubs allowed women to fulfill their traditional roles they also encouraged women to pursue social, intellectual, and community interests. Women took an active role in the [[Progressive Movement]], especially in battles for suffrage, prohibition, and better schools. Women were also prominent in church activities, charity work, and crime reduction.<ref>Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs, \"Montana Women's Clubs at the Turn of the Century\", ''Montana'' March 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}26\u201335</ref>\n\nChildbirth was serious and sometimes life-threatening for rural women well into the 20th century. Although large families were favored by farm families, most women employed birth control methods to space their children and limit their family size. Pregnant women had little access to modern knowledge about prenatal care. Delivery was the big gamble; the great majority gave birth at home, with the services of a midwife or an experienced neighbor. Despite the increased availability of hospital care after the 1920s, modern medical benefits to mitigate the danger of childbirth were not available to most rural Montana women until the World War II era.<ref>Mary Melcher, \"'Women's  Matters': Birth Control, Prenatal Care, and Childbirth in Rural Montana, 1910\u20131940\", ''Montana'' June 1991, Vol. 41 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}47\u201356</ref>\n\n==Agricultural history==\n\n===Cattle ranching===\n[[File:Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site GRKO3395.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Deer Lodge, MT, date unknown]]\nCattle ranching has long been central to Montana's history and economy. Cattle ranching came early to Montana with the entrepreneurship of Johnny Grant in the Deer Lodge Valley in the late 1850s, who traded fat cattle to settlers in exchange for two trail-worn (but otherwise healthy) animals. He later sold his ranch to Conrad Kohrs, who developed a major cattle empire in the area. Today, Grant's core homestead is the  [[Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site]] on the edge of [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]], and is maintained as a living demonstration of the ranching style of the late 19th century. It is operated by the [[National Park Service]].\n\nIn 1866 Nelson Story brought the first herd of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas longhorn]]s up from Texas. Additional herds came into Montana east of the divide and initially expanded greatly on the [[open range]]. Montana stockmen and farmers survived the slump in mining during the early 1870s and were ready by mid-decade to expand eastward onto the plains, as a recovery in mining led to improved markets. However, cattle ranching expanded beyond the carrying capacity of the land, and a drought year combined with the harsh winter of 1886-1887 decimated Montana's cattle industry. The ranchers who survived began to fence in their ranches and the era of the [[open range]] came to an end.<ref>Michael P. Malone, Richard B.

Elofson, ''Frontier Cattle Ranching in the Land and Times of Charlie Russell'' (2005)</ref> The revised [[Homestead Act]] of the early 1900s greatly affected the settlement of Montana. This act expanded the land that was provided by the Homestead Act of 1862 from 160{{nbsp}}acres to 320 ({{convert|160|to|320|acres|disp=out}}). When the latter act was signed by President [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]], it also reduced the time necessary to prove up from five years to three years and permitted five months absence from the claim each year.\n\nIn 1908, the Sun River Irrigation Project, west of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] was opened up for homesteading. Similar irrigation projects developed in many other Montana communities. Under this Reclamation Act, a person could obtain {{convert|40|acres}}. Most of the people who came to file on these [[Homestead Act|homesteads]] were young couples who were eager to live near the mountains where hunting and fishing were good. Many of these homesteaders came from the [[Midwest]] and [[Minnesota]].\n\nFarming was further encouraged by the railroads. Wheat farming started slowly in Montana, only replacing oats as the major grain crop after development of new plant strains, techniques, and machinery. Wheat was stimulated by boom prices in World War I, but slumped in value and yield during the drought and depression of the next 20 years. Beginning in 1905, the Great Northern Railway in cooperation with the US Department of Agriculture, the Montana Experiment Station, and the Dryland Farming Congress promoted dryland farming in Montana in order to increase its freight traffic. During 1910\u201313, the Great Northern launched its own program of demonstration farms, which stimulated settlement (during 1909\u201310 acreage in homesteads quadrupled in Montana) through their impressive production rates for winter wheat, barley, oats and other grains.<ref>Claire Strom, \"The Great Northern Railway and Dryland Farming in Montana\", ''Railroad History'', Summer 1997, Issue 176, pp.{{nbsp}}80\u2013102</ref> As a result of the promotion the land along the Milk River, the northern tier, better known as the \"hi\u2011line\", was settled in 1900\u201315. In an area better suited to grazing cattle, inexperienced newcomers locally called \"Honyockers\" undertook to grow wheat, and met some early success when ample rainfall and high prices were the rule. For several years after 1918, droughts and hot winds destroyed the crops, bringing severe hardships and driving out all but the most determined of the settlers. Much of the land was acquired by stockmen, who have turned it back to grazing cattle.<ref>Mabel Lux, \"Honyockers of Harlem\", ''Montana'' Dec 1963, Vol. 13 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201314</ref>\n\n==Business history==\n\n===Entrepreneurs===\nHenry Sieben (1847\u20131937) came to Montana's gold fields in 1864, was a farm laborer, prospector, and freighter, then turned to livestock raising along the Smith River in 1870. In partnership with his brothers he raised cattle and became one of the territory's pioneer sheep ranchers in 1875. In 1879 Henry moved his stock to the Lewistown area. He established a reputation as an excellent businessman and as someone who took care of his stock and employees. After ranching in the Culbertson area, Sieben purchased ranches near Cascade and along Little Prickly Pear Creek, forming the Sieben Livestock Company. By 1907, these two ranches had become the heart of his cattle and sheep raising business which he directed from his home in Helena. Sieben became well known for his business approach to ranching and for his public and private philanthropies. His family continues to operate the Sieben Ranch Company today,<ref>Dick Pace, \"Henry Sieben: Pioneer Montana Stockman\", ''Montana'' March 1979, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201315</ref> and one of his descendants is United States Senator [[Max Baucus|Max Sieben Baucus]].\n\nAfter seeing the falls of the Missouri River in central Montana, [[Paris Gibson]] (1830\u20131920) decided the location presented an ideal site for a town. Founding [[Great Falls, Montana]], in 1884, Gibson was inspired by a grandiose vision of an economically prosperous city that was also beautiful. He took an active role in the development of Great Falls, as well as Montana as a whole, making his voice heard on issues from dryland farming to the humane treatment of animals. While many of his visionary ideals have long since been passed by, his efforts at community building in the West serve as a unique example and provide an important perspective on the region's continuing development.<ref>Richard B. Roeder, \"A Settlement on the Plains: Paris Gibson and the Building of Great Falls\", ''Montana'' Dec 1992, Vol. 42 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}4\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Conrad families built a substantial banking business in north-central and northwestern Montana during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Banking houses at Fort Benton, Great Falls, and Kalispell, owned and managed by the families of William Conrad and Charles Conrad  helped to finance Montana's economic development through an intricate pattern of familial, friendship, and business ties. Correspondent linkages to large metropolitan banks sustained the relatively small country banks by assuring them access to capital. The Conrad banks were aggressive in penetrating new lending markets and making inroads into the local farming, ranching, merchant, and manufacturing sectors. The banks grew in reputation and stature as the region developed, but remained single-unit, family-based enterprises. But Conrad's expanded across the international border into [[Alberta]] through the Conrad Circle Cattle Company.<ref>Henry C. Klassen, \"The Early Growth of the Conrad Banking Enterprise in Montana, 1880\u20131914\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Jan 1997, Vol. 17 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}49\u201362</ref>\n\nBanking in Montana was a high risk business, as the 1920s demonstrated. Between 1921 and 1925 half of the state's 428 banks closed. There was an excessive number of small, weak banks in the grain-growing areas of Eastern Montana where the postwar slump wiped out land values and related loans.<ref>Clarence W. Groth, \"Sowing and Reaping: Montana Banking, 1910\u20131925\", ''Montana'' Dec 1970, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}28\u201335</ref>\n\nMontana's history was heavily dominated by its \"Copper Kings\".  [[Marcus Daly]] (1841\u20131900), an Irish immigrant, left a legacy of physical structures throughout Montana. Starting with his development of the Alice mine in Butte, he then founded the community of Anaconda where he built a smelter. Butte, with its mixture of poor miners' shacks, richly ornamented homes, mines, and mills, symbolized industrial mining. At Anaconda, the company town, the great Washoe Stack smelted the ore from Butte, bringing immense wealth to the region but also spewed pollutants that left the landscape downwind of the smelter wasted and barren. Daly's lumber mill at Bonner dominated the town. In the agricultural community of [[Hamilton, Montana|Hamilton]], Daly built the {{convert|20000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Bitterroot Stock Farm with its, complete with racetrack and mansion.<ref>Carroll Van West, \"Marcus Daly and Montana: One Man's Imprint on the Land\", ''Montana'' Mar 1987, Vol. 37 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}60\u201362</ref> His archrival, [[William Andrews Clark|W.A. Clark]], invested heavily in the Butte mines and parlayed his influence into the political arena, engineering the selection of [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] over Anaconda as the state capitol. He later was elected as Montana's U.S. Senator under circumstances of such corruption that his antics provided one of the incentives for the Constitutional amendment allowing direct election of senators.\n\nSimon Pepin (1840\u20131914), {{citation needed span|the \"Father of Havre\",|date=February 2016}} was born in Quebec in 1840, emigrated to Montana in 1863, and became a contractor furnishing supplies for the construction of forts Custer, Assiniboine, and Maginnis. Pepin purchased ranch lands near Fort Assiniboine. When [[James J. Hill]] built the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] across northern Montana, Pepin convinced him to build his locomotive shops at [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], on property owned by Pepin. In the ensuing years, Pepin was a major contributor to Havre's economic growth through his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises.<ref>Dave Walter, \"Simon Pepin, A Quiet Capitalist\", ''Montana'' March 1989, Vol. 39 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}34\u201338</ref>\n[[File:Red Lodge Main Street July 2000.jpg|thumb|310px|Main Street in Red Lodge, 2000, showing iron facades on buildings]]\n\nFailures mixed with successes in Montana business history. The closure in 1964 of the Missoula Brewing Company exemplified the difficulties small businesses faced when competing with large producers. Opened in 1900, the brewery closed during Prohibition but resumed production of its Highlander brand in 1933. Government regulation and taxation, isolation, out-of-state competition, and limited promotion reduced the Highlander share of the market following World War II. The brewery closed in 1964 to make way for an interstate highway, ending the era of Montana-brewed beer. Rainier bought the Highlander name, but the former failure in quality control had hurt the Highlander reputation.<ref>John Andrew Kutzman, \"Death of a Small Business: The Missoula Brewing Company\", ''Montana'' March 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}54\u201361</ref>\n\nMany entrepreneurs built stores, shops, and offices along Main Street. The most handsome ones used pre-formed, sheet iron facades, especially those manufactured by the Mesker Brothers of St. Louis. These neoclassical, stylized facades added sophistication to brick or wood-frame buildings throughout the state.<ref>Arthur A. Hart, \"Sheet Iron Elegance: Mail Order Architecture in Montana\", ''Montana'' Dec 1990, Vol. 40 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}26\u201331</ref>\n\n===Retail business===\nIn the rural areas farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criteria was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops or cattle were later sold; the business owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success.<ref>Lewis E. Atherton, ''The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America'' (University of Missouri Press, 1971)</ref>\n\nIn the cities consumers had more choices, usually purchasing dry goods and supplies at locally owned department stores such as  Helena's T.C. Power & Bro, which expanded into several cities, I.G. Baker & Co. in Fort Benton, Strain Bros. of Great Falls, F.A. Buttrey & Co. in Havre, and others. They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. Department stores provided limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks\u2014usually men before the 1940s\u2014were experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class women who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Denver, Minneapolis, and Chicago once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward provided serious competition, so the department stores came to rely even more on salesmanship as well as close integration with the community.<ref>Henry C.

Malone, William L. Lang,  ''The battle for Butte: mining and politics on the northern frontier, 1864\u20131906'' (2006)</ref> From 1892 through 1903, the Anaconda mine in Butte was the largest copper-producing mine in the world. It produced more than $300 million worth of metal in its lifetime. The nearby city of [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]] was the dream child of industrialist [[Marcus Daly]] (1841\u20131900), whose Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM) by 1900 employed three-quarters of Montana's wage earners; it dominated the state's politics and press into the 1950s. The smelters in Anaconda process the copper mined in Butte. From 1884 to 1934, the company fought [[industrial unionism]]; finally in 1901 workers there organized a local of the radical [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM). In 1916, the WFM became the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW), one of the ten original unions of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) in the 1930s. However, the union remained weak until 1934, when members joined with miners, other smelter workers, and some craft laborers in the region in a strike that forced the company to negotiate. In the late 1940s the CIO purged unions controlled by Communists, which meant the expulsion of the IUMMSW and a bid for influence among smelter workers by the anticommunist [[United Steel Workers of America]] (USWA). In 1980, most of the copper mines and smelters were shut down, leaving a major cleanup mess for the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>Laurie Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (University of Illinois Press, 2001)</ref>\n\nButte was one of the largest cities west of the Mississippi for generations. [[Silver Bow County, Montana|Silver Bow county (Butte and suburbs)]] had 24,000 people in 1890, and peaked at 60,000 in 1920. Then the population steadily declined to 34,000 in 1990 and stabilized. In its heyday between the late 19th century and about 1920, it was the largest and most notorious copper [[boomtown]]s in the [[American West]], home to hundreds of [[Western saloon|saloons]] and a famous [[red-light district]]. The documentary [[Butte, America]] depicts its history as a copper producer and the issues of labor unionism, economic rise and decline, and environmental degradation that resulted from the activity.\n\n====Mining camps====\nMany mining camps were established in the late 19th century, some becoming established cities like Butte and [[Red Lodge, Montana|Red Lodge]] which survived the closure of their mines. Others enjoyed a boom period then withered away, though some, such as [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] have since become famed as \"ghost towns\" and have been preserved. Another example was the community of Comet, in what today is Jefferson County, where there were mines and processing mills from 1869 to 1941. At its height, Comet was a town of 12 blocks and 6 streets and by 1911 had extracted $13 million worth of metals (gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper ore), but is now abandoned and decaying. The town's most prominent remains are the mill, office, and bunkhouse, which are leftovers from the last productive years in the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the other structures and buildings have collapsed from neglect.<ref>Christine W. Brown, \"Comet, Montana: The Architecture of Abandonment\", ''Montana'' Dec 2005, Vol. 55 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}60\u201362</ref>\n\n====Anaconda====\nMetals manufacturing dominated life in four Montana communities: Anaconda,<ref>Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (2001)</ref> Black Eagle (a suburb of Great Falls), East Helena, and Columbia Falls. The industrial workers who lived in the shadow of the smokestacks faced health hazards and job insecurity. Wives often worked to supplement the family income and after 1960 women increasingly worked outside the home. The smelters, usually the only workplace for young men who wished to remain in the community, created blue-collar towns. Residents expressed a love-hate relationship with the companies, which paid high wages for semi-skilled workers and supported community projects but were heavy-handed with the workers. Labor unions united the community workers and local business.<ref>Laurie K. Mercier, \"'The Stack Dominated Our Lives': Metals Manufacturing In Four Montana Communities\", ''Montana'' June 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}40\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1903, the [[Socialist Party of America]] won its first victory west of the Mississippi when [[Anaconda, Montana]], elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen. The Socialist Party had grown within the Montana labor movement. Initially, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company tolerated them, but when the Socialists gained political power and threatened to implement reform, particularly when a socialist mayor was also elected in Butte, the company systematically undermine the Socialists. City workers and councilmen refused to cooperate with the new mayor, and the company began to fire Socialists. In the long run labor lost ground in Anaconda and the company exerted ever greater political control.<ref>Jerry Calvert, \"The Rise and Fall of Socialism in a Company Town, 1902\u20131905\", ''Montana'' Dec 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201313</ref>\n\n===Timber===\n<!--section needs expansion-->\nTimber resources were critical to both mines and railroads. Western Montana had ample timber but not always along the most natural railroad routes, and timber near mines was quickly depleted. Thus huge swaths of timber resources were made available to private railroad and mining interests, usually in a checkerboard pattern of ownership interspersed with sections of publicly held land. The communities of Libby, Kalispell and Missoula rose in part due to the demand for timber and their location along strategic waterways.\n\n===Coal===\nMontana holds significant coal reserves and [[strip mining]] became the most economically feasible method by which to extract coal. Major coal deposits were located near the southeastern Montana settlements of Birney and Decker, and mining soon replaced cattle ranching in the immediate area. The small community of [[Colstrip, Montana|Colstrip]] grew substantially as it became the site for several major coal-fired power plants associated at the time with Western Energy, a subsidiary of the [[Montana Power Company]]. For residents of the region, the characteristic sense of community disappeared. The physical damage to the environment was an important factor as was the influx of miners who then outnumbered the original population. Most damaging, however, was the strife between pro- and anti-development factions in the community. Most of the inhabitants of small towns like Decker, convinced their old lifestyle had been destroyed, moved elsewhere. Residents around Birney, farther from the site of strip mining, remained divided on whether the changes had improved their quality of life.<ref>Patrick C. Jobes, \"A Small Rural Community Responds To Coal Development\", ''Sociology and Social Research'', Jan 1986, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}174\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Oil===\n[[File:Bakken Reservoir fields in Williston Basin.jpg|thumb|Map of Williston Basin oil fields with reservoirs in [[Bakken Formation]]]]\nProspectors discovered numerous small oil fields in the state after 1910. The oil went to small local refineries which marketed the gasoline locally through a network of service stations using the same brand name. After 1945 majors such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now [[Exxon-Mobil]]) and [[Union Oil of California]] grew rapidly and by the 1950s owned 80% of refining capacity. In 1949 the value of Montana oil passed the value of copper mining. After 1945 oil production escalated in Alberta, and pipelines were built to Billings to serve the American market. The short-lived Williston Basin boom in the 1950s did not help Montana refiners because pipelines moved the oil out of state for refining. By 1960 Montana refiners depended on Canadian sources. By 2000 only four refineries remained in the state. Production, which peaked at 48 million barrels in 1968, fell by 1990 to less than 20 million, and highly efficient technology significantly reduced employment.<ref>Joseph M. Ashley, \"Montana's Refining Industry. Part 2: 1942\u20131996\", ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'', June 1998, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}16\u201333</ref>\n\nAfter the discovery of oil in the [[Williston Basin]], [[Glendive, Montana|Glendive]] became an oil boom town. The small reserves of the basin, coupled with the expense and difficulty of moving the oil out of the area, brought the end of the oil boom in Glendive in 1954. In the 1970s, new discoveries, combined with international fluctuations in the oil industry, created a second boom centered around the community of [[Sidney, Montana|Sidney]]. This boom also faded.\n\nHowever new drilling techniques involving [[Directional drilling|horizontal drilling]] and fracturing technology, made it financially attractive to drill very deep new wells in the Bakken Formation of the Williston Basin. The discovery in 2000 of the extremely rich [[Elm Coulee Oil Field]] near Sidney in [[Richland County, Montana|Richland County]]\u2014with a potential for many billions of barrels of oil\u2014and the high price of oil has created a new regional boom in the 21st century.<ref>U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration [http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/features/ngshock.pdf \"Technology-Based Oil and Natural Gas Plays: Shale Shock!

The combination of Montana's abundant rivers combined with ready availability of natural resources for transporting electricity led to the building of multiple dams across the state, particularly a number on the Missouri River, most owned and operated by the Montana Power Company. The city of Great Falls, due to the presence of several existing natural cascades, became a center for hydropower development.\n\nIn 1933\u201343, the US [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Public Works Administration]] built the [[Fort Peck Dam]] on the Missouri River; it became the largest earthen dam in the world. The goals were to provide flood control, irrigation water, and (in a later upgrade) hydroelectric power, as well as employment for 10,000 men during the Great Depression. It cost more than $160 million.<ref>Bob Saindon, and Bunky Sullivan, \"Taming the Missouri and Treating the Depression: Fort Peck Dam\", ''Montana'' Sept 1977, 27(3) pp.{{nbsp}}34\u201357</ref>\n\nAs Chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee in the 1950s, Senator [[James E. Murray]] promoted federal development of hydroelectric power through large dams throughout the West. He secured funding for major dams in Montana at Canyon Ferry on the [[Missouri River]], Yellowtail on the [[Bighorn River]], Hungry Horse on the [[Flathead River]], and Libby on the [[Kootenai River]].<ref name=\"Donald F. Spritzer 1985\">Donald F. Spritzer, ''Senator James E. Murray and the Limits of Post-War Liberalism'' (1985)</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMontana politics historically were noted for the tendency of Montanans to vote independently, with split ticket voting common and for races to be likely to fall to either major political party, though certain regions of the state more predictably fell into one partisan camp or the other. At times it was said that Montana \"sent its liberals to Washington and its conservatives to [the state capitol] Helena\". <!-- can cite to Lopach's book on Montana politics for this-->   Considering its relatively brief history, the state produced a number of notable and colorful political figures, including Democrats [[Thomas Francis Meagher]], [[William Andrews Clark]], [[Thomas J. Walsh]], [[Burton K. Wheeler]], [[James E. Murray]], and [[Mike Mansfield]]; and Republicans [[Jeannette Rankin]] and [[Joseph M. Dixon]].\n[[File:JosephMDixon.jpg|thumb|200px|Joseph M.

Dixon]] (1867\u20131934), was a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]]. He served as a [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]], [[United States Senate|Senator]], and the [[List of Governors of Montana|seventh Governor of Montana]]. A businessman and a modernizer of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] heritage, Dixon was a leader of the [[Progressive Movement]] in Montana and nationally in 1912, serving as national campaign manager or Theodore Roosevelt's unsuccessful third term candidacy for president. His term as governor, 1921\u20131924, was unsuccessful, as severe economic hardship limited the opportunities to enact his proposed reforms in state government. His great enemy, the [[Anaconda Copper]] company, mobilized its resources to defeat his reelection bid in 1924.<ref>Jules A.

Murray}}\n<!--maybe shorten this as there is an article on him, ditto for others-->\n[[James E. Murray]] (1876\u20131961) was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, but in 1897 after the death of his father he went to live with a wealthy uncle in Butte, who owned copper mines. Murray, an Irish Catholic, practiced law in Butte and was active in the Democratic Party, working closely with labor unions to build his liberal political base. In 1921, he inherited millions from his late uncle, dabbled in Irish politics, and reentered Montana politics when the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] soured the Montana economy in the 1930s.<ref>John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, ''Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends'' (2003), pp.{{nbsp}}197\u2013228</ref> When Senator Walsh resigned to enter Roosevelt's Cabinet in 1933, John Erickson the Democratic governor had himself appointed to the slot, despite his weak political base. Murray defeated Erickson in the 1934 primary, and was elected senator on the platform of \"one hundred per-cent support\" of President Roosevelt. Murray served in until 1960, becoming a powerful senior senator. Murray was a staunch liberal and aggressive supporter of the [[New Deal Coalition]]. Murray broke with the senior senator  [[Burton K. Wheeler]], also a Democrat.<ref>John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, ''Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends'' (2003), pp.{{nbsp}}161\u2013196 on Wheeler</ref> Wheeler led the opposition to Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, while Murray supported FDR. Unlike Wheeler, Murray gave up his isolationism in foreign affairs, and backed Roosevelt's aggressive foreign policy against Germany and Japan in 1939\u20131941. In 1938 the state's labor federations (AFL and CIO) and the Farmers Union formed the \"Montana Council for Progressive Political Action\" to coordinate support for New Deal liberals like Murray. They opposed the alliance between the Republicans and the conservative Democrats led by Wheeler.<ref>Malone, ''Montana'' (1991) pp.{{nbsp}}307\u2013308</ref> After the war, the conservatives controlled Congress, so Murray had little success with his proposals to expand Social Security, provide free medical care for the aged, expand federal aid to education, or create a Missouri Valley Authority with the federal control over Montana's water resources patterned after the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. Instead, Congress adopted the Pick-Sloan Plan with flood control by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and private development.<ref name=\"Donald F.

Cities such as [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]] saw significant growth related to tourism. Meanwhile, the populations of older mining centers such as Butte and Anaconda shrunk.

In the 2008 and 2010 elections, a Republican majority again gained full control of the legislature, but all five statewide offices remained in Democratic hands. When the [[Montana gubernatorial election, 2012|2012 election]] moved [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]], a Democrat who had been Attorney general to the office of governor, the Attorney General's office moved to Republican hands for the first time since 1992. In 2014 Governor Bullock later appointed Lieutenant Governor [[John Walsh (U.S. politician)|John Walsh]] to become the new senator to replace [[Max Baucus]], the incoming [[United States Ambassador to China|Ambassador to China]]. Baucus had served 1979\u20132014, and played a major role in writing the nation's health care and tax laws. [[United States Senate election in Montana, 2014|The 2014 Senate election]] became a contest between Walsh and Republican Congressman [[Steve Daines]].\n\nCurrent controversial political topics include a recent [[Montana Supreme Court]] decision handed down in late December 2011, ''Western Tradition Partnership v.

In 1872, [[Yellowstone National Park]], situated partially in Montana, was created. In the 1890s the efforts of [[George Bird Grinnell]] (a naturalist) and  [[Louis W.

His  ''Montana: High, Wide and Handsome'' (1943) gave impetus to the environmental movement. Howard fervently believed that small towns of the sort that predominated in Montana provided a democratic bulwark for society. Howard's writings demonstrate his strong belief in the necessity to identify and preserve a region's cultural heritage. His book as numerous speeches and magazine articles, were based on his ideals of community awareness and identity, his hatred of the Anaconda Company, and called on readers to retain an idealistic vision contesting the deadening demands of the modern corporate world.<ref>Richard B. Roeder, \"Joseph Kinsey Howard and his Vision of the West\", ''Montana'' March 1980, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201311</ref> The book's 27 chapters were grouped into sections on Prairie, Prophet, Prospector, Puncher, Plow, Panic, and Planning. Each chapter was written with emotionally charged prose that marked a dramatic change from the standard histories romanticizing the Old West. Howard focused on economics, arguing that Native Americans had \"the perfect balance of Nature, man, and food in this grim and unforgiving land\".  Howard presented themes that reverberated in environmentalist thinking for over a half century, alleging that the white invaders destroyed \"the natural economy of the northern Great Plains\" and in return built little that lasted. Moreover, the new industrial economy, despite all its promises, could never restore the old balance of man and nature.<ref>Howard quoted in Molly Rozum, \"Montana: High, Wide and Handsome\", ''American Review of Canadian Studies'', Aug. 2004, 34(3) pp.{{nbsp}}541\u2013554</ref> Scholars have judged the book \"heavily romantic and melodramatic\" and have called many of his conclusions \"simplistic\", but they also argue ''Montana: High, Wide and Handsome'' \"has probably affected people's thinking about Montana more than any other work\".<ref>Michael P.

''Gros Ventre'' is the [[exonym]] given by the French, who misinterpreted the name given to them by neighboring tribes as \"the people who have enough to eat\", referring to their relative wealth, as \"big bellies\".  The people call themselves (autonym) ''A'ani'' or ''A'aninin'' (white clay people), perhaps related to natural physical formations. They were called the ''Atsina'' by the Assiniboine. The A'ani have 3,682 members and they share [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] with the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], though the two were traditional enemies. The A'ani are classified as a band of [[Arapaho]]; they speak a variant of Arapaho  called ''Gros Ventre'' or ''Atsina''.\n\nThe [[Ktunaxa|Kootenai]] people live west of the Continental Divide.

The creation of the reservation was largely due to the efforts of the Chippewa leader Stone Child (aka \"Rocky Boy\"). The [[Little Shell Chippewa]] also have a presence in Montana, however they do not have a reservation.\n\nOther native people had a significant presence in Montana, though today do not have a reservation within the state.

Through interactions with [[Iroquois]] between 1812 and 1820, the [[Bitterroot Salish|Salish]] people learned about Christianity and the [[Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] (known as \"blackrobes\"), who worked with Native tribes teaching about agriculture, medicine, and religion. Interest in these \"blackrobes\" grew among the Salish. In 1831, four young Salish men were dispatched to St. Louis, Missouri to request a \"blackrobe\" to return with them to their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley. The four Salish men were directed to the home and office of [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] (of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark fame]]) to make their request. At that time Clark was in charge of administering the territory they called home. Through the perils of their trip, two died at the home of General Clark. The remaining two secured a visit with St. Louis Bishop [[Joseph Rosati]], who assured them that missionaries would be sent to the [[Bitterroot Valley]] when funds and missionaries were available in the future.\n\nAgain in 1835 and 1837 the Salish dispatched men to St. Louis to request missionaries but to no avail. Finally in 1839 a group of Iroquois and Salish met Father [[Pierre-Jean DeSmet]] in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].

The U.S. Army took over the commercial fort in 1869 and a detachment of the 7th Infantry remained in the town until 1881.  Its location on the Missouri River marked the farthest practical point upriver that steamboats could navigate. With the arrival of the first steamboats in 1860, the town of Fort Benton began to develop outside the fort's walls and developed into a major trading center over the next 27 years, until it was supplanted with the arrival of railroads in the Montana Territory.  An original blockhouse still remaining in the largely reconstructed fort is the oldest building in Montana still on its original foundations, giving rise to the town's reputation as \"the birthplace of Montana\".\n\n===Fort Ellis===\nBuilt near the mouth of the Gallatin Valley, [[Fort Ellis]] played an important role in many of the early Indian conflicts in the territory.

It also provided a staging location for many missions of exploration and survey into the region that became [[Yellowstone National Park]].\n\n===Fort Shaw===\n[[Fort Shaw, Montana|Fort Shaw]] was established in the spring of 1867 located west of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] in the Sun River Valley. Two posts built at the time were [[Camp Cooke (Montana)|Camp Cooke]] on the [[Judith River]] and [[Fort C. F. Smith (Fort Smith, Montana)|Fort C.F. Smith]] on the [[Bozeman Trail]] in south central Montana Territory. Fort Shaw was built of adobe and lumber by the 13th Infantry. The fort had a parade ground that was 400 feet (120 m) square, and consisted of barracks for officers, a hospital, and a trading post, and could house up to 450 soldiers. The soldiers mainly guarded the Benton-Helena Road, the major supply-line from [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]], which was the head of navigation on the [[Missouri River]], to the gold mining districts in southwestern Montana Territory. The fort was decommissioned in 1891. The following year, 1892, the 20 buildings on the site were adapted for the Fort Shaw Indian Industrial School. The school boarded young Native people to assimilate them, teach them English, and educate them in modern technology; it had as many as 17 faculty members, 11 Native assistants, and 300 students.\n<!--Add: Fort Keough, Fort Ellis, Fort Harrison, Malmstron AFB, etc.-->\n\n==Montana Territory==\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Montana Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:NMA.0039209 Emigration.

Montana was admitted to the Union as the [[Montana|state of Montana]] on November 8, 1889.\n\n==Indian Wars==\n\n===Battle of the Little Big Horn===\n{{Main|Battle of the Little Bighorn|George Armstrong Custer}}\nThe [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]\u2014also called Custer's Last Stand and the Battle of the Greasy Grass\u2014was an armed engagement between a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux)-[[Northern Cheyenne]]-[[Arapaho]] combined force and the [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] of the [[United States Army]]. It occurred June 25\u2013June 26, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in eastern Montana Territory near present-day [[Hardin, Montana]], on land that today is part of the [[Crow Indian Reservation]].<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904, pp. 1008-1011.</ref> The Crow tribe [[Crow Scouts|sided with the U.S. army]].<ref>Hoxie, Frederick E.: Parading Through History. The Making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935. Cambridge, 1995, p. 108.</ref> [[George Armstrong Custer]], with 257 men attacked a much larger force of Native Americans, who were defending their civilian encampments, and in three hours the Custer battalion was completely annihilated. Only two men from the 7th Cavalry later claimed to have seen the battle: a young Crow whose name translated as [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], and a trooper named [[Peter Thompson (soldier)|Peter Thompson]], who had fallen behind Custer's column, and most accounts of the last moments of Custer's forces are conjecture. Lakota accounts assert that [[Crazy Horse]] personally led one of the large groups of Lakota who overwhelmed the cavalry. While exact numbers are difficult to determine, it is commonly estimated that the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota outnumbered the 7th Cavalry by approximately 3:1, a ratio that was extended to 5:1 during the fragmented parts of the battle.\n\nLater, the [[Lakota people|Sioux]] were defeated in a series of subsequent battles by the reinforced U.S. Army who continued attacking even in the winter, and most were forced to move onto reservations, mostly outside of Montana, primarily by tactics such as preventing buffalo hunts and enforcing government food-distribution policies to \"friendlies\" only. The Lakota were compelled to sign a treaty in 1877 ceding the [[Black Hills]] to the United States, but a low-intensity war continued, culminating, fourteen years later, in the killing of [[Sitting Bull]] (December 15, 1890) at [[Standing Rock]] and the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] (December 29, 1890) at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]].\n\n===Northern Cheyenne exodus===\n[[File:Cheyenne using travois.jpg|thumb|Stump Horn and family (Northern Cheyenne); showing home and horse-drawn travois.]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], attempts by the U.S. Army to capture the Cheyenne intensified. A group of 972 Cheyenne was escorted to [[Indian Territory]] in Oklahoma in 1877. The government intended to re-unite the Northern and Southern Cheyenne into one nation. There the conditions were dire; the Northern Cheyenne were not used to the climate and soon many became ill with [[malaria]]. In addition, the food rations were insufficient and of poor quality. In 1878, the two principal Chiefs, [[Little Wolf]] and Morning Star ([[Dull Knife]]) pressed for the release of the Cheyenne so they could travel back north. However, they were denied permission, so that same year the two men led a group of 353 Northern Cheyenne who left Indian Territory to travel back north. The Army and other civilian volunteers were in hot pursuit of the Cheyenne as they traveled north. It is estimated that a total of 13,000 Army soldiers and volunteers were sent to pursue the Cheyenne over the whole course of their journey north.\n\nAfter crossing into Nebraska, the group split into two. One group was led by [[Little Wolf]], and the other by Dull Knife. Little Wolf and his band made it back to [[Montana]]. Dull Knife and his band were captured and escorted to [[Fort Robinson]], [[Nebraska]] and sequestered. They were ordered to return to Oklahoma but they refused. Conditions at the fort grew tense through the end of 1878 and soon the Cheyenne were confined to barracks with no food, water, or heat. In January 1879, Dull Knife and his group broke out of Ft. Robinson. Much of the group was gunned down as they ran away from the fort, and others were discovered near the fort during the following days and ordered to surrender but most of the escapees chose to fight because they would rather be killed than taken back into custody. It is estimated that only 50 survived the breakout, including Dull Knife. Several of the escapees later had to stand trial for the murders that had been committed in Kansas. The remains of those killed were repatriated in 1994.\n\nUltimately, the military gave up attempting to relocate the Northern Cheyenne in Oklahoma. The persistence of the Northern Cheyenne resulted in the creation of the Northern Cheyenne reservation in Montana.<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904, pp. 594\u2013596.</ref>\n\n===The flight of the Nez Perce===\n[[File:ChiefJoseph.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Chief Joseph]]\nThe [[Nez Perce people]] were settled what today is Washington and Oregon, though made hunting forays into western Montana. However, in 1877 pressure from white settlers led to several incidents of violence and a significant number of the Nez Perce were forced from their home region and fled rather than submit to being moved to a reservation. With 2000 U.S. soldiers in pursuit, 800 Nez Perce spent over three months outmaneuvering and battling their pursuers, led by General Howard. They traveled {{convert|1700|mi|km}} across Oregon, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], Idaho, [[Yellowstone National Park]], and [[Montana]]. In the process, they held off the Army at the [[Battle of the Big Hole]] in southwestern Montana, dropped into Yellowstone Park, then traveled into east-central Montana where they attempted to ally with both the Crow and the Arapaho, but were rebuffed due to tensions surrounding the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. They then turned north, attempting to reach Canada.\n\nGeneral Howard, leading the United States cavalry, was impressed with the skill with which the Nez Perce fought, using advance and rear guards, skirmish lines, and field fortifications. However, unbeknownst to the Nez Perce, a force led by [[Nelson A. Miles]] was dispatched from eastern Montana on a quick march to intercept them, which occurred less than {{convert|40|mi}} south of Canada in the [[Bear Paw Mountains]], not far from present-day [[Chinook, Montana|Chinook]] in [[Blaine County, Montana|Blaine County]]. Finally, after a devastating five-day battle during freezing weather conditions with no food or blankets, having lost the major war leaders, Chief Joseph formally [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]] to General  Miles on October 5, 1877.\n\n===Louis Riel and the Metis===\nSome [[M\u00e9tis]] from the British territory to the north settled in Montana in the latter half of the 19th century. For a time, [[Louis Riel]], the M\u00e9tis leader from Manitoba in exile, taught school at [[St. Peter's Mission Church and Cemetery|St. Peter's Mission]] in Montana and was active in the local Republican Party. Democrats alleged he helped M\u00e9tis men, who were not American citizens, to vote for the Republicans. In the summer of 1884, a delegation of M\u00e9tis leaders including [[Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] and [[James Isbister]], convinced Riel to return north, where in the following year he led the M\u00e9tis revolt against Canadian rule, known as the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Following the defeat of the M\u00e9tis rebels and the imprisonment and later hanging to Riel, Gabriel Dumont fled to exile in Montana.\n\n==Railroads==\nThe railroads were the engine of settlement in the state. Major development occurred in the 1880s. The [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] was given land grants by the federal government so that it could borrow money to build its system, reaching [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] in 1882. The federal government kept every other section of land, and gave it away to homesteaders. At first the railroad sold much of its holdings at low prices to land speculators in order to realize quick cash profits, and also to eliminate sizable annual tax bills. The speculators in turn parceled out the land on credit to farmers and ranchers eager to develop operations near a railroad. By 1905 the company changed its land policies as it realize it had been a costly mistake to have sold so much land at wholesale prices. With better railroad service and improved methods of farming the Northern Pacific easily sold what had been heretofore \"worthless\" land directly to farmers at good prices. By 1910 the railroad's holdings in North Dakota had been greatly reduced.<ref>Ross R. Controneo, \"Northern Pacific Officials and the Disposition of the Railroad's Land Grant in North Dakota after 1888\", ''North Dakota History'', 1970, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}77\u2013103</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]] energetically promoted settlement along its lines in the northern part of the state. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government\u2014it received no land grants\u2014and resold them to farmers one by one. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost.<ref>David H. Hickcox, \"The Impact of the Great  Northern Railway on Settlement in Northern Montana, 1880\u20131920\", ''Railroad History'', Summer 1983, Issue 148, pp.{{nbsp}}58\u201367</ref><ref>Robert F.

In 1907-09 Taft served as a boisterous construction town for the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad. The camp included many ethnic groups, numerous saloons and prostitutes, and substantial violence. When construction was finished, the camp was abandoned.<ref>Virginia Weisel Johnson, \"Tough Taft: Boom Town\". ''Montana'' Dec 1982, Vol. 32 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}50\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1882 the Northern Pacific platted [[Livingston, Montana]], a major division point, repair and maintenance center, and gateway to [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Built in symmetrical fashion along both sides of the track, the city grew to 7,000 by 1914. Several structures built between 1883 and 1914 still exist and provide a physical record of the era and indicate the city's role as a rail and tourist center. The Northern Pacific depot reflects the desire to impress the tourists who disembarked here for Yellowstone Park, and the railroad's machine shops reveal the city's industrial history.<ref>\"Livingston: Railroad Town on the Yellowstone\", ''Montana''  Dec 1985, Vol. 35 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}84\u201386</ref>\n\n==Women==\n<!--seems a little undue, may also want to more on ethnicity of early settlers (German, Irish, Scandavian, etc.) in this general part of the article)-->\nIn Montana, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details.<ref>Laurie K. Mercier, \"Women's  Role in Montana Agriculture: 'You Had To Make Every Minute Count,'\" ''Montana'' Dec 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}50\u201361</ref>\n\n[[File:Jeannetterankin.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeannette Rankin, August 1916]]\nEfforts to write woman suffrage into Montana's 1889 constitution failed. Montana women, especially \"society women\", did not strongly support the suffragists. However, help from national leaders and the efforts of Montana supporters of suffrage such as [[Jeannette Rankin]] (1880\u20131973), led to success in 1914 when voters ratified a suffrage amendment passed by the legislature in 1913. In 1916, Rankin, a Republican, became the first woman ever elected to Congress. She was elected again in 1940. Rankin was a peace activist, who voted against American entry into both World War I and World War II.<ref>James J. Lopach, and Jean A. Luckowski. ''Jeannette Rankin: a political woman'' (2005)</ref>\n\nThe status of women in the 19th-century West has drawn the attention of numerous scholars, whose interpretations fall into three types: 1) the Frontier school influenced by [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], which argues that the West was a liberating experience for women and men; 2) the reactionists, who view the West as a place of drudgery for women, who reacted unfavorably to the isolation and difficult work environment in the West; and 3) those writers who claim the West had no distinctive effect on women's lives, that it was a static, neutral frontier. Cole (1990) uses legal records  to argue that the Turner thesis best explains the improvement in women's status in Montana and the early achievement of suffrage.<ref>Judith K. Cole, \"A Wide Field for Usefulness: Women'S  Civil Status and the Evolution of Women's  Suffrage on The Montana Frontier, 1864\u20131914\", ''American Journal of Legal History'', July 1990, Vol. 34 Issue 3, pp.{{nbsp}}262\u2013294</ref>\n\nWomen's clubs expressed the interests, needs, and beliefs of middle class women around the start of the 20th century. While accepting the domestic role established by the [[cult of domesticity]], their reformist activities reveal a persistent demand for self-expression outside the home. Homesteading was a significant experience for altering women's perceptions of their roles. They expressed their aesthetic interests in gardens and organized social activities. Though these clubs allowed women to fulfill their traditional roles they also encouraged women to pursue social, intellectual, and community interests. Women took an active role in the [[Progressive Movement]], especially in battles for suffrage, prohibition, and better schools. Women were also prominent in church activities, charity work, and crime reduction.<ref>Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs, \"Montana Women's Clubs at the Turn of the Century\", ''Montana'' March 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}26\u201335</ref>\n\nChildbirth was serious and sometimes life-threatening for rural women well into the 20th century. Although large families were favored by farm families, most women employed birth control methods to space their children and limit their family size. Pregnant women had little access to modern knowledge about prenatal care. Delivery was the big gamble; the great majority gave birth at home, with the services of a midwife or an experienced neighbor. Despite the increased availability of hospital care after the 1920s, modern medical benefits to mitigate the danger of childbirth were not available to most rural Montana women until the World War II era.<ref>Mary Melcher, \"'Women's  Matters': Birth Control, Prenatal Care, and Childbirth in Rural Montana, 1910\u20131940\", ''Montana'' June 1991, Vol. 41 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}47\u201356</ref>\n\n==Agricultural history==\n\n===Cattle ranching===\n[[File:Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site GRKO3395.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Deer Lodge, MT, date unknown]]\nCattle ranching has long been central to Montana's history and economy. Cattle ranching came early to Montana with the entrepreneurship of Johnny Grant in the Deer Lodge Valley in the late 1850s, who traded fat cattle to settlers in exchange for two trail-worn (but otherwise healthy) animals. He later sold his ranch to Conrad Kohrs, who developed a major cattle empire in the area. Today, Grant's core homestead is the  [[Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site]] on the edge of [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]], and is maintained as a living demonstration of the ranching style of the late 19th century. It is operated by the [[National Park Service]].\n\nIn 1866 Nelson Story brought the first herd of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas longhorn]]s up from Texas. Additional herds came into Montana east of the divide and initially expanded greatly on the [[open range]]. Montana stockmen and farmers survived the slump in mining during the early 1870s and were ready by mid-decade to expand eastward onto the plains, as a recovery in mining led to improved markets. However, cattle ranching expanded beyond the carrying capacity of the land, and a drought year combined with the harsh winter of 1886-1887 decimated Montana's cattle industry. The ranchers who survived began to fence in their ranches and the era of the [[open range]] came to an end.<ref>Michael P. Malone, Richard B.

Elofson, ''Frontier Cattle Ranching in the Land and Times of Charlie Russell'' (2005)</ref> The revised [[Homestead Act]] of the early 1900s greatly affected the settlement of Montana. This act expanded the land that was provided by the Homestead Act of 1862 from 160{{nbsp}}acres to 320 ({{convert|160|to|320|acres|disp=out}}). When the latter act was signed by President [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]], it also reduced the time necessary to prove up from five years to three years and permitted five months absence from the claim each year.\n\nIn 1908, the Sun River Irrigation Project, west of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] was opened up for homesteading. Similar irrigation projects developed in many other Montana communities. Under this Reclamation Act, a person could obtain {{convert|40|acres}}. Most of the people who came to file on these [[Homestead Act|homesteads]] were young couples who were eager to live near the mountains where hunting and fishing were good. Many of these homesteaders came from the [[Midwest]] and [[Minnesota]].\n\nFarming was further encouraged by the railroads. Wheat farming started slowly in Montana, only replacing oats as the major grain crop after development of new plant strains, techniques, and machinery. Wheat was stimulated by boom prices in World War I, but slumped in value and yield during the drought and depression of the next 20 years. Beginning in 1905, the Great Northern Railway in cooperation with the US Department of Agriculture, the Montana Experiment Station, and the Dryland Farming Congress promoted dryland farming in Montana in order to increase its freight traffic. During 1910\u201313, the Great Northern launched its own program of demonstration farms, which stimulated settlement (during 1909\u201310 acreage in homesteads quadrupled in Montana) through their impressive production rates for winter wheat, barley, oats and other grains.<ref>Claire Strom, \"The Great Northern Railway and Dryland Farming in Montana\", ''Railroad History'', Summer 1997, Issue 176, pp.{{nbsp}}80\u2013102</ref> As a result of the promotion the land along the Milk River, the northern tier, better known as the \"hi\u2011line\", was settled in 1900\u201315. In an area better suited to grazing cattle, inexperienced newcomers locally called \"Honyockers\" undertook to grow wheat, and met some early success when ample rainfall and high prices were the rule. For several years after 1918, droughts and hot winds destroyed the crops, bringing severe hardships and driving out all but the most determined of the settlers. Much of the land was acquired by stockmen, who have turned it back to grazing cattle.<ref>Mabel Lux, \"Honyockers of Harlem\", ''Montana'' Dec 1963, Vol. 13 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201314</ref>\n\n==Business history==\n\n===Entrepreneurs===\nHenry Sieben (1847\u20131937) came to Montana's gold fields in 1864, was a farm laborer, prospector, and freighter, then turned to livestock raising along the Smith River in 1870. In partnership with his brothers he raised cattle and became one of the territory's pioneer sheep ranchers in 1875. In 1879 Henry moved his stock to the Lewistown area. He established a reputation as an excellent businessman and as someone who took care of his stock and employees. After ranching in the Culbertson area, Sieben purchased ranches near Cascade and along Little Prickly Pear Creek, forming the Sieben Livestock Company. By 1907, these two ranches had become the heart of his cattle and sheep raising business which he directed from his home in Helena. Sieben became well known for his business approach to ranching and for his public and private philanthropies. His family continues to operate the Sieben Ranch Company today,<ref>Dick Pace, \"Henry Sieben: Pioneer Montana Stockman\", ''Montana'' March 1979, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201315</ref> and one of his descendants is United States Senator [[Max Baucus|Max Sieben Baucus]].\n\nAfter seeing the falls of the Missouri River in central Montana, [[Paris Gibson]] (1830\u20131920) decided the location presented an ideal site for a town. Founding [[Great Falls, Montana]], in 1884, Gibson was inspired by a grandiose vision of an economically prosperous city that was also beautiful. He took an active role in the development of Great Falls, as well as Montana as a whole, making his voice heard on issues from dryland farming to the humane treatment of animals. While many of his visionary ideals have long since been passed by, his efforts at community building in the West serve as a unique example and provide an important perspective on the region's continuing development.<ref>Richard B. Roeder, \"A Settlement on the Plains: Paris Gibson and the Building of Great Falls\", ''Montana'' Dec 1992, Vol. 42 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}4\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Conrad families built a substantial banking business in north-central and northwestern Montana during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Banking houses at Fort Benton, Great Falls, and Kalispell, owned and managed by the families of William Conrad and Charles Conrad  helped to finance Montana's economic development through an intricate pattern of familial, friendship, and business ties. Correspondent linkages to large metropolitan banks sustained the relatively small country banks by assuring them access to capital. The Conrad banks were aggressive in penetrating new lending markets and making inroads into the local farming, ranching, merchant, and manufacturing sectors. The banks grew in reputation and stature as the region developed, but remained single-unit, family-based enterprises. But Conrad's expanded across the international border into [[Alberta]] through the Conrad Circle Cattle Company.<ref>Henry C. Klassen, \"The Early Growth of the Conrad Banking Enterprise in Montana, 1880\u20131914\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Jan 1997, Vol. 17 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}49\u201362</ref>\n\nBanking in Montana was a high risk business, as the 1920s demonstrated. Between 1921 and 1925 half of the state's 428 banks closed. There was an excessive number of small, weak banks in the grain-growing areas of Eastern Montana where the postwar slump wiped out land values and related loans.<ref>Clarence W. Groth, \"Sowing and Reaping: Montana Banking, 1910\u20131925\", ''Montana'' Dec 1970, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}28\u201335</ref>\n\nMontana's history was heavily dominated by its \"Copper Kings\".  [[Marcus Daly]] (1841\u20131900), an Irish immigrant, left a legacy of physical structures throughout Montana. Starting with his development of the Alice mine in Butte, he then founded the community of Anaconda where he built a smelter. Butte, with its mixture of poor miners' shacks, richly ornamented homes, mines, and mills, symbolized industrial mining. At Anaconda, the company town, the great Washoe Stack smelted the ore from Butte, bringing immense wealth to the region but also spewed pollutants that left the landscape downwind of the smelter wasted and barren. Daly's lumber mill at Bonner dominated the town. In the agricultural community of [[Hamilton, Montana|Hamilton]], Daly built the {{convert|20000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Bitterroot Stock Farm with its, complete with racetrack and mansion.<ref>Carroll Van West, \"Marcus Daly and Montana: One Man's Imprint on the Land\", ''Montana'' Mar 1987, Vol. 37 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}60\u201362</ref> His archrival, [[William Andrews Clark|W.A. Clark]], invested heavily in the Butte mines and parlayed his influence into the political arena, engineering the selection of [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] over Anaconda as the state capitol. He later was elected as Montana's U.S. Senator under circumstances of such corruption that his antics provided one of the incentives for the Constitutional amendment allowing direct election of senators.\n\nSimon Pepin (1840\u20131914), {{citation needed span|the \"Father of Havre\",|date=February 2016}} was born in Quebec in 1840, emigrated to Montana in 1863, and became a contractor furnishing supplies for the construction of forts Custer, Assiniboine, and Maginnis. Pepin purchased ranch lands near Fort Assiniboine. When [[James J. Hill]] built the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] across northern Montana, Pepin convinced him to build his locomotive shops at [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], on property owned by Pepin. In the ensuing years, Pepin was a major contributor to Havre's economic growth through his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises.<ref>Dave Walter, \"Simon Pepin, A Quiet Capitalist\", ''Montana'' March 1989, Vol. 39 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}34\u201338</ref>\n[[File:Red Lodge Main Street July 2000.jpg|thumb|310px|Main Street in Red Lodge, 2000, showing iron facades on buildings]]\n\nFailures mixed with successes in Montana business history. The closure in 1964 of the Missoula Brewing Company exemplified the difficulties small businesses faced when competing with large producers. Opened in 1900, the brewery closed during Prohibition but resumed production of its Highlander brand in 1933. Government regulation and taxation, isolation, out-of-state competition, and limited promotion reduced the Highlander share of the market following World War II. The brewery closed in 1964 to make way for an interstate highway, ending the era of Montana-brewed beer. Rainier bought the Highlander name, but the former failure in quality control had hurt the Highlander reputation.<ref>John Andrew Kutzman, \"Death of a Small Business: The Missoula Brewing Company\", ''Montana'' March 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}54\u201361</ref>\n\nMany entrepreneurs built stores, shops, and offices along Main Street. The most handsome ones used pre-formed, sheet iron facades, especially those manufactured by the Mesker Brothers of St. Louis. These neoclassical, stylized facades added sophistication to brick or wood-frame buildings throughout the state.<ref>Arthur A. Hart, \"Sheet Iron Elegance: Mail Order Architecture in Montana\", ''Montana'' Dec 1990, Vol. 40 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}26\u201331</ref>\n\n===Retail business===\nIn the rural areas farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criteria was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops or cattle were later sold; the business owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success.<ref>Lewis E. Atherton, ''The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America'' (University of Missouri Press, 1971)</ref>\n\nIn the cities consumers had more choices, usually purchasing dry goods and supplies at locally owned department stores such as  Helena's T.C. Power & Bro, which expanded into several cities, I.G. Baker & Co. in Fort Benton, Strain Bros. of Great Falls, F.A. Buttrey & Co. in Havre, and others. They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. Department stores provided limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks\u2014usually men before the 1940s\u2014were experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class women who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Denver, Minneapolis, and Chicago once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward provided serious competition, so the department stores came to rely even more on salesmanship as well as close integration with the community.<ref>Henry C.

Malone, William L. Lang,  ''The battle for Butte: mining and politics on the northern frontier, 1864\u20131906'' (2006)</ref> From 1892 through 1903, the Anaconda mine in Butte was the largest copper-producing mine in the world. It produced more than $300 million worth of metal in its lifetime. The nearby city of [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]] was the dream child of industrialist [[Marcus Daly]] (1841\u20131900), whose Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM) by 1900 employed three-quarters of Montana's wage earners; it dominated the state's politics and press into the 1950s. The smelters in Anaconda process the copper mined in Butte. From 1884 to 1934, the company fought [[industrial unionism]]; finally in 1901 workers there organized a local of the radical [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM). In 1916, the WFM became the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW), one of the ten original unions of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) in the 1930s. However, the union remained weak until 1934, when members joined with miners, other smelter workers, and some craft laborers in the region in a strike that forced the company to negotiate. In the late 1940s the CIO purged unions controlled by Communists, which meant the expulsion of the IUMMSW and a bid for influence among smelter workers by the anticommunist [[United Steel Workers of America]] (USWA). In 1980, most of the copper mines and smelters were shut down, leaving a major cleanup mess for the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>Laurie Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (University of Illinois Press, 2001)</ref>\n\nButte was one of the largest cities west of the Mississippi for generations. [[Silver Bow County, Montana|Silver Bow county (Butte and suburbs)]] had 24,000 people in 1890, and peaked at 60,000 in 1920. Then the population steadily declined to 34,000 in 1990 and stabilized. In its heyday between the late 19th century and about 1920, it was the largest and most notorious copper [[boomtown]]s in the [[American West]], home to hundreds of [[Western saloon|saloons]] and a famous [[red-light district]]. The documentary [[Butte, America]] depicts its history as a copper producer and the issues of labor unionism, economic rise and decline, and environmental degradation that resulted from the activity.\n\n====Mining camps====\nMany mining camps were established in the late 19th century, some becoming established cities like Butte and [[Red Lodge, Montana|Red Lodge]] which survived the closure of their mines. Others enjoyed a boom period then withered away, though some, such as [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] have since become famed as \"ghost towns\" and have been preserved. Another example was the community of Comet, in what today is Jefferson County, where there were mines and processing mills from 1869 to 1941. At its height, Comet was a town of 12 blocks and 6 streets and by 1911 had extracted $13 million worth of metals (gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper ore), but is now abandoned and decaying. The town's most prominent remains are the mill, office, and bunkhouse, which are leftovers from the last productive years in the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the other structures and buildings have collapsed from neglect.<ref>Christine W. Brown, \"Comet, Montana: The Architecture of Abandonment\", ''Montana'' Dec 2005, Vol. 55 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}60\u201362</ref>\n\n====Anaconda====\nMetals manufacturing dominated life in four Montana communities: Anaconda,<ref>Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (2001)</ref> Black Eagle (a suburb of Great Falls), East Helena, and Columbia Falls. The industrial workers who lived in the shadow of the smokestacks faced health hazards and job insecurity. Wives often worked to supplement the family income and after 1960 women increasingly worked outside the home. The smelters, usually the only workplace for young men who wished to remain in the community, created blue-collar towns. Residents expressed a love-hate relationship with the companies, which paid high wages for semi-skilled workers and supported community projects but were heavy-handed with the workers. Labor unions united the community workers and local business.<ref>Laurie K. Mercier, \"'The Stack Dominated Our Lives': Metals Manufacturing In Four Montana Communities\", ''Montana'' June 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}40\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1903, the [[Socialist Party of America]] won its first victory west of the Mississippi when [[Anaconda, Montana]], elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen. The Socialist Party had grown within the Montana labor movement. Initially, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company tolerated them, but when the Socialists gained political power and threatened to implement reform, particularly when a socialist mayor was also elected in Butte, the company systematically undermine the Socialists. City workers and councilmen refused to cooperate with the new mayor, and the company began to fire Socialists. In the long run labor lost ground in Anaconda and the company exerted ever greater political control.<ref>Jerry Calvert, \"The Rise and Fall of Socialism in a Company Town, 1902\u20131905\", ''Montana'' Dec 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201313</ref>\n\n===Timber===\n<!--section needs expansion-->\nTimber resources were critical to both mines and railroads. Western Montana had ample timber but not always along the most natural railroad routes, and timber near mines was quickly depleted. Thus huge swaths of timber resources were made available to private railroad and mining interests, usually in a checkerboard pattern of ownership interspersed with sections of publicly held land. The communities of Libby, Kalispell and Missoula rose in part due to the demand for timber and their location along strategic waterways.\n\n===Coal===\nMontana holds significant coal reserves and [[strip mining]] became the most economically feasible method by which to extract coal. Major coal deposits were located near the southeastern Montana settlements of Birney and Decker, and mining soon replaced cattle ranching in the immediate area. The small community of [[Colstrip, Montana|Colstrip]] grew substantially as it became the site for several major coal-fired power plants associated at the time with Western Energy, a subsidiary of the [[Montana Power Company]]. For residents of the region, the characteristic sense of community disappeared. The physical damage to the environment was an important factor as was the influx of miners who then outnumbered the original population. Most damaging, however, was the strife between pro- and anti-development factions in the community. Most of the inhabitants of small towns like Decker, convinced their old lifestyle had been destroyed, moved elsewhere. Residents around Birney, farther from the site of strip mining, remained divided on whether the changes had improved their quality of life.<ref>Patrick C. Jobes, \"A Small Rural Community Responds To Coal Development\", ''Sociology and Social Research'', Jan 1986, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}174\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Oil===\n[[File:Bakken Reservoir fields in Williston Basin.jpg|thumb|Map of Williston Basin oil fields with reservoirs in [[Bakken Formation]]]]\nProspectors discovered numerous small oil fields in the state after 1910. The oil went to small local refineries which marketed the gasoline locally through a network of service stations using the same brand name. After 1945 majors such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now [[Exxon-Mobil]]) and [[Union Oil of California]] grew rapidly and by the 1950s owned 80% of refining capacity. In 1949 the value of Montana oil passed the value of copper mining. After 1945 oil production escalated in Alberta, and pipelines were built to Billings to serve the American market. The short-lived Williston Basin boom in the 1950s did not help Montana refiners because pipelines moved the oil out of state for refining. By 1960 Montana refiners depended on Canadian sources. By 2000 only four refineries remained in the state. Production, which peaked at 48 million barrels in 1968, fell by 1990 to less than 20 million, and highly efficient technology significantly reduced employment.<ref>Joseph M. Ashley, \"Montana's Refining Industry. Part 2: 1942\u20131996\", ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'', June 1998, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp.{{nbsp}}16\u201333</ref>\n\nAfter the discovery of oil in the [[Williston Basin]], [[Glendive, Montana|Glendive]] became an oil boom town. The small reserves of the basin, coupled with the expense and difficulty of moving the oil out of the area, brought the end of the oil boom in Glendive in 1954. In the 1970s, new discoveries, combined with international fluctuations in the oil industry, created a second boom centered around the community of [[Sidney, Montana|Sidney]]. This boom also faded.\n\nHowever new drilling techniques involving [[Directional drilling|horizontal drilling]] and fracturing technology, made it financially attractive to drill very deep new wells in the Bakken Formation of the Williston Basin. The discovery in 2000 of the extremely rich [[Elm Coulee Oil Field]] near Sidney in [[Richland County, Montana|Richland County]]\u2014with a potential for many billions of barrels of oil\u2014and the high price of oil has created a new regional boom in the 21st century.<ref>U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration [http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/features/ngshock.pdf \"Technology-Based Oil and Natural Gas Plays: Shale Shock! Could There Be Billions in the Bakken?\"] (2006)</ref>\n\n===Dams and hydropower===\n<!--needs a better section with historical details, just popping in a \"quick and dirty\" for now-->\nThe development of electrical power led to demand for electricity. The combination of Montana's abundant rivers combined with ready availability of natural resources for transporting electricity led to the building of multiple dams across the state, particularly a number on the Missouri River, most owned and operated by the Montana Power Company. The city of Great Falls, due to the presence of several existing natural cascades, became a center for hydropower development.\n\nIn 1933\u201343, the US [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Public Works Administration]] built the [[Fort Peck Dam]] on the Missouri River; it became the largest earthen dam in the world. The goals were to provide flood control, irrigation water, and (in a later upgrade) hydroelectric power, as well as employment for 10,000 men during the Great Depression. It cost more than $160 million.<ref>Bob Saindon, and Bunky Sullivan, \"Taming the Missouri and Treating the Depression: Fort Peck Dam\", ''Montana'' Sept 1977, 27(3) pp.{{nbsp}}34\u201357</ref>\n\nAs Chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee in the 1950s, Senator [[James E. Murray]] promoted federal development of hydroelectric power through large dams throughout the West. He secured funding for major dams in Montana at Canyon Ferry on the [[Missouri River]], Yellowtail on the [[Bighorn River]], Hungry Horse on the [[Flathead River]], and Libby on the [[Kootenai River]].<ref name=\"Donald F. Spritzer 1985\">Donald F. Spritzer, ''Senator James E. Murray and the Limits of Post-War Liberalism'' (1985)</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMontana politics historically were noted for the tendency of Montanans to vote independently, with split ticket voting common and for races to be likely to fall to either major political party, though certain regions of the state more predictably fell into one partisan camp or the other. At times it was said that Montana \"sent its liberals to Washington and its conservatives to [the state capitol] Helena\". <!-- can cite to Lopach's book on Montana politics for this-->   Considering its relatively brief history, the state produced a number of notable and colorful political figures, including Democrats [[Thomas Francis Meagher]], [[William Andrews Clark]], [[Thomas J.

He served as a [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]], [[United States Senate|Senator]], and the [[List of Governors of Montana|seventh Governor of Montana]]. A businessman and a modernizer of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] heritage, Dixon was a leader of the [[Progressive Movement]] in Montana and nationally in 1912, serving as national campaign manager or Theodore Roosevelt's unsuccessful third term candidacy for president. His term as governor, 1921\u20131924, was unsuccessful, as severe economic hardship limited the opportunities to enact his proposed reforms in state government. His great enemy, the [[Anaconda Copper]] company, mobilized its resources to defeat his reelection bid in 1924.<ref>Jules A.

Murray}}\n<!--maybe shorten this as there is an article on him, ditto for others-->\n[[James E. Murray]] (1876\u20131961) was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, but in 1897 after the death of his father he went to live with a wealthy uncle in Butte, who owned copper mines. Murray, an Irish Catholic, practiced law in Butte and was active in the Democratic Party, working closely with labor unions to build his liberal political base. In 1921, he inherited millions from his late uncle, dabbled in Irish politics, and reentered Montana politics when the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] soured the Montana economy in the 1930s.<ref>John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, ''Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends'' (2003), pp.{{nbsp}}197\u2013228</ref> When Senator Walsh resigned to enter Roosevelt's Cabinet in 1933, John Erickson the Democratic governor had himself appointed to the slot, despite his weak political base. Murray defeated Erickson in the 1934 primary, and was elected senator on the platform of \"one hundred per-cent support\" of President Roosevelt. Murray served in until 1960, becoming a powerful senior senator. Murray was a staunch liberal and aggressive supporter of the [[New Deal Coalition]]. Murray broke with the senior senator  [[Burton K. Wheeler]], also a Democrat.<ref>John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, ''Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends'' (2003), pp.{{nbsp}}161\u2013196 on Wheeler</ref> Wheeler led the opposition to Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, while Murray supported FDR. Unlike Wheeler, Murray gave up his isolationism in foreign affairs, and backed Roosevelt's aggressive foreign policy against Germany and Japan in 1939\u20131941. In 1938 the state's labor federations (AFL and CIO) and the Farmers Union formed the \"Montana Council for Progressive Political Action\" to coordinate support for New Deal liberals like Murray. They opposed the alliance between the Republicans and the conservative Democrats led by Wheeler.<ref>Malone, ''Montana'' (1991) pp.{{nbsp}}307\u2013308</ref> After the war, the conservatives controlled Congress, so Murray had little success with his proposals to expand Social Security, provide free medical care for the aged, expand federal aid to education, or create a Missouri Valley Authority with the federal control over Montana's water resources patterned after the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. Instead, Congress adopted the Pick-Sloan Plan with flood control by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and private development.<ref name=\"Donald F.

Cities such as [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]] saw significant growth related to tourism.

In the 2008 and 2010 elections, a Republican majority again gained full control of the legislature, but all five statewide offices remained in Democratic hands. When the [[Montana gubernatorial election, 2012|2012 election]] moved [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]], a Democrat who had been Attorney general to the office of governor, the Attorney General's office moved to Republican hands for the first time since 1992.

Roeder, \"Joseph Kinsey Howard and his Vision of the West\", ''Montana'' March 1980, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp.{{nbsp}}2\u201311</ref> The book's 27 chapters were grouped into sections on Prairie, Prophet, Prospector, Puncher, Plow, Panic, and Planning. Each chapter was written with emotionally charged prose that marked a dramatic change from the standard histories romanticizing the Old West. Howard focused on economics, arguing that Native Americans had \"the perfect balance of Nature, man, and food in this grim and unforgiving land\".  Howard presented themes that reverberated in environmentalist thinking for over a half century, alleging that the white invaders destroyed \"the natural economy of the northern Great Plains\" and in return built little that lasted. Moreover, the new industrial economy, despite all its promises, could never restore the old balance of man and nature.<ref>Howard quoted in Molly Rozum, \"Montana: High, Wide and Handsome\", ''American Review of Canadian Studies'', Aug. 2004, 34(3) pp.{{nbsp}}541\u2013554</ref> Scholars have judged the book \"heavily romantic and melodramatic\" and have called many of his conclusions \"simplistic\", but they also argue ''Montana: High, Wide and Handsome'' \"has probably affected people's thinking about Montana more than any other work\".<ref>Michael P.

{"title_page": "Bose\u2013Einstein statistics", "text_new": "{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=[[Particle statistics|Particle Statistics]]}}\nIn [[quantum statistics]], '''Bose\u2013Einstein statistics''' (or '''B\u2013E statistics''') describe one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting, indistinguishable [[particles]] may occupy a set of available discrete [[Energy level|energy states]] at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of [[Laser#Quantum vs. classical emission processes|laser light]] and the frictionless creeping of [[Superfluid helium-4|superfluid helium]]. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924\u201325) by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by [[Albert Einstein]] in collaboration with Bose.\n\nThe Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply only to those particles not limited to single occupancy of the same state\u2014that is, particles that do not obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] restrictions. Such particles have integer values of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and are named [[boson]]s, after the statistics that correctly describe their behaviour. There must also be no significant interaction between the particles.\n\n[[Image:Fermi-Dirac Bose-Einstein Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.svg|256px|thumb|right|Comparison of average occupancy of the ground state for three statistics]]\n==Bose\u2013Einstein distribution==\nAt low temperatures, bosons behave differently from [[fermion]]s (which obey the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]) in a way that an unlimited number of them can \"condense\" into the same energy state. This apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter &ndash; the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply when [[quantum|quantum effects]] are important and the particles are \"[[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]\". Quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies\n:<math>\\frac{N}{V} \\ge n_q, </math>\nwhere {{mvar|N}} is the number of particles, {{mvar|V}} is the volume, and {{math|''n''<sub>''q''</sub>}} is the [[quantum concentration]], for which the interparticle distance is equal to the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]], so that the [[wavefunction]]s of the particles are barely overlapping.\n\nFermi\u2013Dirac statistics apply to fermions (particles that obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply to [[bosons]]. As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, most systems at high temperatures obey the classical (Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann) limit, unless they also have a very high density, as for a [[white dwarf]]. Both Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein become [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]] at high temperature or at low concentration.\n\nB\u2013E statistics was introduced for [[photon]]s in 1924 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and generalized to atoms by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1924\u201325.\n\nThe expected number of particles in an energy state ''i'' for B\u2013E statistics is:{{Equation box 1|border|indent=:|equation=<math> \\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu) / k_{\\rm B} T} - 1} ,</math>|cellpadding=6|border colour=#0070BF|bgcolor=#FAFFFB|title=}}with {{math|''\u03b5<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> ''\u03bc''}} and where {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} is the number of particles in state {{math|''i'', ''g<sub>i</sub>''}} is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of energy level {{math|''i'', ''\u03b5<sub>i</sub>''}} is the [[energy]] of the ''i''-th state, ''\u03bc'' is the [[chemical potential]], {{Math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].\n\nFor comparison, the average number of fermions with energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> given by [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics#Distribution of particles over energy|Fermi\u2013Dirac particle-energy distribution]] has a similar form:\n:<math> \\bar{n}_i(\\epsilon_i) = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} + 1}.</math>\n\nAs mentioned above, both the Bose-Einstein distribution and the Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution approaches the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics#Limits of applicability|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions: \n\n* In the limit of low particle density, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}\\pm 1} \\ll 1\n</math>, therefore <math>\ne^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\pm 1 \\gg 1\n</math> or equivalently <math>\ne^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\gg 1\n</math>. In that case, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i \\approx \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}}=\\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\\varepsilon_i/k_{\\rm B}T}\n</math>, which is the result from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n* In the limit of high temperature, the particles are distributed over a large range of energy values, therefore the occupancy on each state (especially the high energy ones with <math> \\varepsilon_i - \\mu \\gg k_{\\rm B}T </math>) is again very small, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\pm 1} \\ll 1\n</math>. This again reduces to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n\nIn addition to reducing to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] in the limit of high <math>T</math> and low density, B\u2013E statistics also reduce to [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] distribution for low energy states with <math> \\varepsilon_i - \\mu \\ll k_{\\rm B}T </math>, namely \n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n\\bar{n}_i & = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}-1} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{g_i}{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} = \\frac{g_i k_{\\rm B}T}{\\varepsilon_i - \\mu}.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n==History==\nWhile presenting a lecture at the [[University of Dhaka]] (in what was then [[British India]] and now [[Bangladesh]]) on the theory of radiation and the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results. During this lecture, Bose committed an error in applying the theory, which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment. The error was a simple mistake\u2014similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time\u2014that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (remarkably, this error resembled the famous blunder by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] known from his ''Croix ou Pile'' article<ref>{{Cite journal|last=d'Alembert|first=Jean|date=1754|title=Croix ou pile|url=|journal=L'Encyclop\u00e9die|language=fr|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Dalembert/croix_ou_pile.pdf|title=CROIX OU PILE|last=d'Alembert|first=Jean|date=1754|website=Xavier University|trans-title=Translated by Richard J. Pulskamp|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>). However, the results it predicted agreed with experiment, and Bose realized it might not be a mistake after all. For the first time, he took the position that the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales. Thus, he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space, where each state is a little patch having phase volume of ''h''<sup>3</sup>, and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable.\n\nBose adapted this lecture into a short article called ''Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta''<ref>See p. 14, note 3, of the thesis: {{cite thesis\n |type=Ph.D.\n |first=Alessandro\n |last=Michelangeli\n |url=https://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/handle/20.500.11767/4185/1874/1963_5272_PhD_Michelangeli.pdf\n |title=Bose-Einstein condensation: Analysis of problems and rigorous results\n |date=October 2007\n |publisher=[[International School for Advanced Studies]]\n |accessdate=14 February 2019\n |url-status=live\n |lay-url=https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/4185?mode=full.1187\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103022036/https://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/handle/20.500.11767/4185/1874/1963_5272_PhD_Michelangeli.pdf\n |archivedate=3 November 2018\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Bose<!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--> |url=http://www.condmat.uni-oldenburg.de/TeachingSP/bose.ps |format=PostScript |title=Planck's law and the hypothesis of light quanta |work=[[University of Oldenburg]] |date=2 July 1924 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and submitted it to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''. However, the referee's report was negative, and the paper was rejected. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Albert Einstein requesting publication in the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''.

The paper came out in 1924.<ref>{{Citation | first = <!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--> | last = Bose | title = Plancks Gesetz und Lichtquantenhypothese | journal = [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 178\u2013181 | year = 1924 | language = German | bibcode = 1924ZPhy...26..178B | doi = 10.1007/BF01327326}}</ref>\n\nThe reason Bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third, and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional (classical, distinguishable) coins. Bose's \"error\" leads to what is now called Bose\u2013Einstein statistics.\n\nBose and Einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]], a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.\n\n==Derivation==\n\n=== Derivation from the microcanonical ensemble ===\nIn the [[microcanonical ensemble]], one considers a system with fixed energy, volume, and number of particles. We take a system composed of <math>N=\\Sigma_i n_i</math> identical bosons, <math>n_i</math> of which have energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> and are distributed over <math>g_i</math> levels or states with the same energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math>, i.e. <math>g_i</math> is the degeneracy associated with energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> of total energy <math>E=\\Sigma_i n_i\\epsilon_i</math>. Calculation of the number of arrangements of <math>n_i</math> particles distributed among <math>g_i</math> states is a problem of [[combinatorics]]. Since particles and states are indistinguishable in the quantum mechanical context here, and starting with a state, the number of arrangements is\n\n:<math> w_{\\rm BE} = \\frac{(g+n-1)!}{n! (g-1)!} = C^{g+n-1}_n, </math>\n\nwhere <math> C^{m}_k </math> is the [[combination|''k''-combination]] of a set with ''m'' elements.\n\nIf we start with a particle first, the number is\n\n:<math>w^*_{\\rm BE} = \\frac{(g+n-1)!}{g!\\, (n-1)!} = C^{g+n-1}_g.</math>\n\nThe sum is\n:<math> w^'_{\\rm BE}= \\frac{(g+n)!}{g!\\,n!} = C^{g+n}_g.</math>\n\nSince here all numbers are large, the distinction is irrelevant in the present context. The total number of arrangements in an ensemble of bosons is\n:<math> W_{\\rm BE} =\\prod_i\\frac{(n_i +g_i -1)!}{(g_i-1)! n_i!}.</math>\nThe maximum number of arrangements determining the corresponding occupation number <math>n_i</math> is obtained looking the condition that maximizes the [[entropy]], or equivalently, setting <math>\\mathrm{d}(\\ln W_{\\rm BE}) = 0</math> and taking the subsidiary conditions <math>N=\\Sigma n_i, E=\\Sigma_in_i\\epsilon_i</math> into account (as [[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrange multipliers]]).<ref name=\":0\" /> The result for a large number of particles is the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n\nThe expressions <math>w_{\\rm BE}, w^*_{\\rm BE}</math> are of considerable interest in many problems of combinatorics. For non-huge values of <math>n</math> and <math>g</math> the [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]] <math>C^n_r, C^{n+r-1}_r</math> are given by [[Pascal's triangle|Pascal's triangles]]. For more details about the combinatorics, see the notes of the canonical derivation.\n\n=== Derivation from the grand canonical ensemble ===\nThe Bose\u2013Einstein distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is easily derived from the [[grand canonical ensemble]].<ref name=\"sriva7\">{{cite book\n |title=Statistical Mechanics\n |last1=Srivastava |first1=R.

That is, the number of particles within the overall system ''that occupy a given single particle state'' form a sub-ensemble that is also grand canonical ensemble; hence, it may be analysed through the construction of a [[grand partition function]].\n\nEvery single-particle state is of a fixed energy, <math>\\epsilon</math>. As the sub-ensemble associated with a single-particle state varies by the number of particles only, it is clear that the total energy of the sub-ensemble is also directly proportional to the number of particles in the single-particle state; where <math>N</math> is the number of particles, the total energy of the sub-ensemble will then be <math>N\\epsilon</math>. Beginning with the standard expression for a grand partition function and replacing <math>\\epsilon</math> with <math>N\\epsilon</math>, the grand partition function takes the form\n\n<math>\n\\mathcal Z = \\sum_{N} \\exp((N\\mu - N\\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T) = \\sum_{N} \\exp(N(\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T)\n</math>\n\nThis formula applies to fermionic systems as well as bosonic systems. Fermi-Dirac statistics arise when considering the effect of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: whilst the number of fermions occupying the same single-particle state can only be either 1 or 0, the number of bosons occupying a single particle state may be any integer. Thus, the grand partition function for bosons can be considered a [[geometric series]] and may be evaluated as such:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\\mathcal Z & = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(N(\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T) = \\sum_{N=0}^\\infty [\\exp((\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B}T)]^N \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp((\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T)}\\end{align}</math>\nand the average particle number for that single-particle substate is given by\n:<math> \\langle N\\rangle = k_{\\rm B} T \\frac{1}{\\mathcal Z} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal Z}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_{V,T} = \\frac{1}{\\exp((\\epsilon-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B} T)-1} </math>\nThis result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution for the entire state of the system.<ref name=\"sriva6\">{{cite book\n |title=Statistical Mechanics\n |chapter=Chapter 6  \n |isbn=9788120327825\n|date=January 2005 \n }}</ref><ref>The BE distribution can be derived also from thermal field theory.</ref>\n\nThe variance in particle number (due to [[thermal fluctuations]]) may also be derived:\n:<math> \\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle = k_{\\rm B} T \\left(\\frac{d\\langle N\\rangle}{d\\mu}\\right)_{V,T} = \\langle N^2\\rangle - \\langle N\\rangle^2 </math>\nThis level of fluctuation is much larger than for [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics|distinguishable particles]], which would instead show [[Poisson statistics]] <math>\\left(\\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle = \\langle N\\rangle^2\\right) </math>. The reason is that the [[probability distribution]] for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a [[geometric distribution]], not a [[Poisson distribution]].\n\n=== Derivation in the canonical approach ===\n\nIt is also possible to derive approximate Bose\u2013Einstein statistics in the [[canonical ensemble]].\nThese derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles.\nThe reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble. The Bose\u2013Einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization, but the mathematically best derivation is by the [[Darwin\u2013Fowler method]] of mean values as emphasized by Dingle.<ref>R.B.

Suppose each level contains \n<math>\\displaystyle g_i</math>\ndistinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta, in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. \nThe value of  \n<math>\\displaystyle g_i</math> associated with level <math>\\displaystyle i</math> is called the \"degeneracy\" of that energy level.

The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:\n\n:<math>\nW = \\prod_i w(n_i,g_i) =  \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}\n\\approx\\prod_i \\frac{(n_i+g_i)!}{n_i!(g_i)!}\n</math>\n\nwhere the approximation assumes that <math>n_i \\gg 1</math>.\n\nFollowing the same procedure used in deriving the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]], we wish to find the set of  <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> for which  ''W'' is maximised, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed total number of particles, and a fixed total energy. The maxima of <math>\\displaystyle W</math> and <math>\\displaystyle \\ln(W)</math> occur at the same value of  <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximise the latter function instead.

The enumeration of cases (or ways) in the B\u2013E distribution can be recast as \nfollows.  Consider a game of dice throwing in which there are \n<math>\\displaystyle n</math> dice, \nwith each die taking values in the set \n<math>\\displaystyle \\{ 1, \\dots, g \\}</math>, for <math>g \\ge 1</math>.  \nThe constraints of the game are that the value of a die \n<math>\\displaystyle i</math>, denoted by <math>\\displaystyle m_i</math>, has to be \n'''''greater than or equal to''''' the value of die \n<math>\\displaystyle (i-1)</math>, denoted by \n<math>\\displaystyle m_{i-1}</math>, in the previous throw, i.e., \n<math>m_i \\ge m_{i-1}</math>.  Thus a valid sequence of die throws can be described by an \n''n''-tuple \n<math>\\displaystyle ( m_1 , m_2 , \\dots , m_n)</math>, such that <math>m_i \\ge m_{i-1}</math>.

The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of [[Laser#Quantum vs. classical emission processes|laser light]] and the frictionless creeping of [[Superfluid helium-4|superfluid helium]]. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924\u201325) by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by [[Albert Einstein]] in collaboration with Bose.\n\nThe Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply only to those particles not limited to single occupancy of the same state\u2014that is, particles that do not obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] restrictions. Such particles have integer values of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and are named [[boson]]s, after the statistics that correctly describe their behaviour. There must also be no significant interaction between the particles.\n\n[[Image:Fermi-Dirac Bose-Einstein Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.svg|256px|thumb|right|Comparison of average occupancy of the ground state for three statistics]]\n==Bose\u2013Einstein distribution==\nAt low temperatures, bosons behave differently from [[fermion]]s (which obey the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]) in a way that an unlimited number of them can \"condense\" into the same energy state. This apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter &ndash; the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply when [[quantum|quantum effects]] are important and the particles are \"[[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]\". Quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies\n:<math>\\frac{N}{V} \\ge n_q, </math>\nwhere {{mvar|N}} is the number of particles, {{mvar|V}} is the volume, and {{math|''n''<sub>''q''</sub>}} is the [[quantum concentration]], for which the interparticle distance is equal to the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]], so that the [[wavefunction]]s of the particles are barely overlapping.\n\nFermi\u2013Dirac statistics apply to fermions (particles that obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics apply to [[bosons]]. As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, most systems at high temperatures obey the classical (Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann) limit, unless they also have a very high density, as for a [[white dwarf]]. Both Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein become [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]] at high temperature or at low concentration.\n\nB\u2013E statistics was introduced for [[photon]]s in 1924 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and generalized to atoms by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1924\u201325.\n\nThe expected number of particles in an energy state ''i'' for B\u2013E statistics is:{{Equation box 1|border|indent=:|equation=<math> \\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu) / k_{\\rm B} T} - 1} ,</math>|cellpadding=6|border colour=#0070BF|bgcolor=#FAFFFB|title=}}with {{math|''\u03b5<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> ''\u03bc''}} and where {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} is the number of particles in state {{math|''i'', ''g<sub>i</sub>''}} is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of energy level {{math|''i'', ''\u03b5<sub>i</sub>''}} is the [[energy]] of the ''i''-th state, ''\u03bc'' is the [[chemical potential]], {{Math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].\n\nFor comparison, the average number of fermions with energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> given by [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics#Distribution of particles over energy|Fermi\u2013Dirac particle-energy distribution]] has a similar form:\n:<math> \\bar{n}_i(\\epsilon_i) = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} + 1}.</math>\n\nAs mentioned above, both the Bose-Einstein distribution and the Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution approaches the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics#Limits of applicability|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions: \n\n* In the limit of low particle density, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}\\pm 1} \\ll 1\n</math>, therefore <math>\ne^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\pm 1 \\gg 1\n</math> or equivalently <math>\ne^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\gg 1\n</math>. In that case, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i \\approx \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}}=\\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\\varepsilon_i/k_{\\rm B}T}\n</math>, which is the result from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n* In the limit of high temperature, the particles are distributed over a large range of energy values, therefore the occupancy on each state (especially the high energy ones with <math> \\varepsilon_i - \\mu \\gg k_{\\rm B}T </math>) is again very small, <math>\n\\bar{n}_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} \\pm 1} \\ll 1\n</math>. This again reduces to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n\nIn addition to reducing to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] in the limit of high <math>T</math> and low density, B\u2013E statistics also reduce to [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] distribution for low energy states with <math> \\varepsilon_i - \\mu \\ll k_{\\rm B}T </math>, namely \n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n\\bar{n}_i & = \\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T}-1} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{g_i}{(\\varepsilon_i-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B}T} = \\frac{g_i k_{\\rm B}T}{\\varepsilon_i - \\mu}.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n==History==\nWhile presenting a lecture at the [[University of Dhaka]] (in what was then [[British India]] and now [[Bangladesh]]) on the theory of radiation and the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results. During this lecture, Bose committed an error in applying the theory, which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment. The error was a simple mistake\u2014similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time\u2014that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (remarkably, this error resembled the famous blunder by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] known from his ''Croix ou Pile'' article<ref>{{Cite journal|last=d'Alembert|first=Jean|date=1754|title=Croix ou pile|url=|journal=L'Encyclop\u00e9die|language=fr|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Dalembert/croix_ou_pile.pdf|title=CROIX OU PILE|last=d'Alembert|first=Jean|date=1754|website=Xavier University|trans-title=Translated by Richard J. Pulskamp|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>). However, the results it predicted agreed with experiment, and Bose realized it might not be a mistake after all. For the first time, he took the position that the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales. Thus, he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space, where each state is a little patch having phase volume of ''h''<sup>3</sup>, and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable.\n\nBose adapted this lecture into a short article called ''Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta''<ref>See p. 14, note 3, of the thesis: {{cite thesis\n |type=Ph.D.\n |first=Alessandro\n |last=Michelangeli\n |url=https://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/handle/20.500.11767/4185/1874/1963_5272_PhD_Michelangeli.pdf\n |title=Bose-Einstein condensation: Analysis of problems and rigorous results\n |date=October 2007\n |publisher=[[International School for Advanced Studies]]\n |accessdate=14 February 2019\n |url-status=live\n |lay-url=https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/4185?mode=full.1187\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103022036/https://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/handle/20.500.11767/4185/1874/1963_5272_PhD_Michelangeli.pdf\n |archivedate=3 November 2018\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Bose<!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--> |url=http://www.condmat.uni-oldenburg.de/TeachingSP/bose.ps |format=PostScript |title=Planck's law and the hypothesis of light quanta |work=[[University of Oldenburg]] |date=2 July 1924 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and submitted it to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''. However, the referee's report was negative, and the paper was rejected. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Albert Einstein requesting publication in the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''. Einstein immediately agreed, personally translated the article from English into German (Bose had earlier translated Einstein's article on the theory of General Relativity from German to English), and saw to it that it was published. Bose's theory achieved respect when Einstein sent his own paper in support of Bose's to ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik'', asking that they be published together. The paper came out in 1924.<ref>{{Citation | first = <!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--> | last = Bose | title = Plancks Gesetz und Lichtquantenhypothese | journal = [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 178\u2013181 | year = 1924 | language = German | bibcode = 1924ZPhy...26..178B | doi = 10.1007/BF01327326}}</ref>\n\nThe reason Bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third, and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional (classical, distinguishable) coins. Bose's \"error\" leads to what is now called Bose\u2013Einstein statistics.\n\nBose and Einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]], a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.\n\n==Derivation==\n\n=== Derivation from the microcanonical ensemble ===\nIn the [[microcanonical ensemble]], one considers a system with fixed energy, volume, and number of particles. We take a system composed of <math>N=\\Sigma_i n_i</math> identical bosons, <math>n_i</math> of which have energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> and are distributed over <math>g_i</math> levels or states with the same energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math>, i.e. <math>g_i</math> is the degeneracy associated with energy <math>\\epsilon_i</math> of total energy <math>E=\\Sigma_i n_i\\epsilon_i</math>. Calculation of the number of arrangements of <math>n_i</math> particles distributed among <math>g_i</math> states is a problem of [[combinatorics]].

For more details about the combinatorics, see the notes of the canonical derivation.\n\n=== Derivation from the grand canonical ensemble ===\nThe Bose\u2013Einstein distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is easily derived from the [[grand canonical ensemble]].<ref name=\"sriva7\">{{cite book\n |title=Statistical Mechanics\n |last1=Srivastava |first1=R.

That is, the number of particles within the overall system ''that occupy a given single particle state'' form a sub-ensemble that is also grand canonical ensemble; hence, it may be analysed through the construction of a [[grand partition function]].\n\nEvery single-particle state is of a fixed energy, <math>\\epsilon</math>. As the sub-ensemble associated with a single-particle state varies by the number of particles only, it is clear that the total energy of the sub-ensemble is also directly proportional to the number of particles in the single-particle state; where <math>N</math> is the number of particles, the total energy of the sub-ensemble will then be <math>N\\epsilon</math>. Beginning with the standard expression for a grand partition function and replacing <math>\\epsilon</math> with <math>N\\epsilon</math>, the grand partition function takes the form\n\n<math>\n\\mathcal Z = \\sum_{N} \\exp((N\\mu - N\\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T) = \\sum_{N} \\exp(N(\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T)\n</math>\n\nThis formula applies to fermionic systems as well as bosonic systems. Bose-Einstein statistics arise when considering the effect of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: whilst the number of fermions occupying the same single-particle state can only be either 1 or 0, the number of bosons occupying a single particle state may be any integer. Thus, the grand partition function for bosons can be considered a [[geometric series]] and may be evaluated as such:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\\mathcal Z & = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(N(\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T) = \\sum_{N=0}^\\infty [\\exp((\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B}T)]^N \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp((\\mu - \\epsilon)/k_{\\rm B} T)}\\end{align}</math>\nand the average particle number for that single-particle substate is given by\n:<math> \\langle N\\rangle = k_{\\rm B} T \\frac{1}{\\mathcal Z} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal Z}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_{V,T} = \\frac{1}{\\exp((\\epsilon-\\mu)/k_{\\rm B} T)-1} </math>\nThis result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution for the entire state of the system.<ref name=\"sriva6\">{{cite book\n |title=Statistical Mechanics\n |chapter=Chapter 6  \n |isbn=9788120327825\n|date=January 2005 \n }}</ref><ref>The BE distribution can be derived also from thermal field theory.</ref>\n\nThe variance in particle number (due to [[thermal fluctuations]]) may also be derived:\n:<math> \\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle = k_{\\rm B} T \\left(\\frac{d\\langle N\\rangle}{d\\mu}\\right)_{V,T} = \\langle N^2\\rangle - \\langle N\\rangle^2 </math>\nThis level of fluctuation is much larger than for [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics|distinguishable particles]], which would instead show [[Poisson statistics]] <math>\\left(\\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle = \\langle N\\rangle^2\\right) </math>. The reason is that the [[probability distribution]] for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a [[geometric distribution]], not a [[Poisson distribution]].\n\n=== Derivation in the canonical approach ===\n\nIt is also possible to derive approximate Bose\u2013Einstein statistics in the [[canonical ensemble]].\nThese derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles.\nThe reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble. The Bose\u2013Einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization, but the mathematically best derivation is by the [[Darwin\u2013Fowler method]] of mean values as emphasized by Dingle.<ref>R.B.

Suppose each level contains \n<math>\\displaystyle g_i</math>\ndistinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta, in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. \nThe value of  \n<math>\\displaystyle g_i</math> associated with level <math>\\displaystyle i</math> is called the \"degeneracy\" of that energy level.

The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:\n\n:<math>\nW = \\prod_i w(n_i,g_i) =  \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}\n\\approx\\prod_i \\frac{(n_i+g_i)!}{n_i!(g_i)!}\n</math>\n\nwhere the approximation assumes that <math>n_i \\gg 1</math>.\n\nFollowing the same procedure used in deriving the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]], we wish to find the set of  <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> for which  ''W'' is maximised, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed total number of particles, and a fixed total energy. The maxima of <math>\\displaystyle W</math> and <math>\\displaystyle \\ln(W)</math> occur at the same value of  <math>\\displaystyle n_i</math> and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximise the latter function instead.

The enumeration of cases (or ways) in the B\u2013E distribution can be recast as \nfollows.

Thus a valid sequence of die throws can be described by an \n''n''-tuple \n<math>\\displaystyle ( m_1 , m_2 , \\dots , m_n)</math>, such that <math>m_i \\ge m_{i-1}</math>.

This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W.

The following year, the six remaining townships became magisterial districts.

This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Monroe County was initially divided into seven townships: Forest Hill, Red Sulphur, Second Creek, Springfield, Sweet Springs, Union, and Wolf Creek.  In 1871, part of Forest Hill Township was added to the new county of [[Summers County, West Virginia|Summers]], and the remaining territory distributed between Red Sulphur and Springfield Townships.  The following year, the six remaining townships became magisterial districts.  Except for minor adjustments, the six historic magisterial districts were unchanged until the 1990s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: Central, Eastern, and Western.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMonroe County lies on the southeast side of West Virginia.
