The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J. Lang]], won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and became a long-running hit. The show was produced in London in 1984 (winning the [[Olivier Award]] for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony for Best Revival.\n\nBased on the novel by [[Bradford Ropes]] and the subsequent [[42nd Street (film)|1933 Hollywood film adaptation]], the [[backstage musical]] show focuses on the efforts of famed [[dictator]]ial [[Great White Way]] director Julian Marsh to mount a successful stage production of a musical extravaganza at the height of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe show is a [[jukebox musical]] of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film ''42nd Street'', it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Roman Scandals]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', ''[[Go into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[The Singing Marine]]''. It also includes \"There's a Sunny Side to Every Situation\", written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]''.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J. Lang]], won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and became a long-running hit. The show was produced in London in 1984 (winning the [[Olivier Award]] for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony for Best Revival.\n\nBased on the novel by [[Bradford Ropes]] and the subsequent [[42nd Street (film)|1933 Hollywood film adaptation]], the [[backstage musical]] show focuses on the efforts of famed [[dictator]]ial [[Great White Way]] director Julian Marsh to mount a successful stage production of a musical extravaganza at the height of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe show is a [[jukebox musical]] of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film ''42nd Street'', it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Roman Scandals]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', ''[[Go into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[The Singing Marine]]''. It also includes \"There's a Sunny Side to Every Situation\", written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]''. A 2017 revival added the song \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Al Dubin song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", written by Warren and Dubin for ''[[Moulin Rouge (1934 film)|Moulin Rouge]]''.\n\n==Background==\n[[theatre producer|Producer]] [[David Merrick]] \"took a huge gamble with his $3 million production based on the 1933 Warner Brothers film musical\", as \"only one other show had made the transfer from original movie musical to the stage \u2014 ''Gigi'', a flop in 1974.\"<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |title=42nd Street History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923125830/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |archive-date=September 23, 2011|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sptimes\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |title=Floridian Renovating 42nd Street |last=Fleming |first=John |date=April 28, 2003 |website=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029215029/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |archive-date=October 29, 2005}}</ref> He felt audiences once again were ready to embrace the [[nostalgia]] craze started by the successful revivals of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'', and his own ''[[Very Good Eddie]]'' several years earlier, and augmented the familiar songs from the film's soundtrack with a liberal dose of popular tunes from the Dubin-Warren catalog.<ref name=pbs/> According to theater historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]], \"When the curtain slowly rose to reveal forty pairs of tap-dancing feet, the star-studded opening night audience at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] cheered...Champion followed this number with a series of tap-infused extravaganzas larger and more polished than anything Broadway really had in the 1930s.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |title=History of the Musical Stage: The 1980s |last=Kenrick |first=John |authorlink=John Kenrick (theatre writer) |date=1996\u20132004 |website=musicals101.com |archive-url=http://musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n===Original Broadway===\nIn June 1980, the musical premiered in out-of-town tryouts at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Lardner, James. \"Familiar 'Street'; Hokey Tune of the '30s\", ''The Washington Post'', June 25, 1980, p.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

Dunne was nominated five times for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] \u2013 for her performances in ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1931), ''[[Theodora Goes Wild]]'' (1936), ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937), ''[[Love Affair (1939 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1939), and ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' (1948). In 1985, Dunne was given the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] for her services to the arts.\n\n==Early life==\nIrene Marie Dunn was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to Joseph John Dunn (1863\u20131909), a steamboat engineer/inspector for the United States government,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|page=7}} and Adelaide Henry (1871\u20131936), a concert pianist/music teacher from Newport, Kentucky. Dunne would later write, \"No triumph of either my stage or screen career has ever rivalled the excitement of trips down the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] on the [[riverboat]]s with my father.\" She was eleven{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} when her father died from a kidney infection;{{sfn|Gehring 2003|page=8}} she saved all of his letters and often remembered and lived by what he told her the night before he died: \"Happiness is never an accident. It is the prize we get when we choose wisely from life's great stores.\"{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}}\n\nFollowing her father's death, Irene, her mother, and her younger brother Charles moved to her mother's hometown of [[Madison, Indiana]].{{sfn|Gehring 2003|page=11}} Dunne's mother taught her to play the piano as a very small girl.

She toured several provincial cities in 1921\u201322 playing the lead role in the popular play ''Irene'',<ref>''Logansport Pharos-Tribune'', March 18, 1922</ref> before making her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1922 in [[Zelda Sears]]'s ''[[The Clinging Vine]]''.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=9171 ''The Clinging Vine''], Internet Broadway Database</ref> The following year, Dunne played a season of [[light opera]] in Atlanta, Georgia, though in her own words Dunne created \"no great furor\". On July 16, 1927, Dunne married Francis Griffin, a New York dentist,<ref>''The Indianapolis Star'', July 31, 1927, p 57</ref> whom she had met in 1924 at a supper dance in New York. Despite differing opinions and battles that raged furiously,{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} Dunne eventually agreed to marry him. Dunne later moved to Hollywood with her mother and brother and maintained a long-distance marriage with her husband in New York until he joined her in California in 1936.\n[[File:Irene Dunne with her husband.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Candid of Dunne with husband Dr. Francis Griffin.]]\nBy 1929, she had a successful Broadway career playing leading roles. Dunne's role as Magnolia Hawks in [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]'' was the result of a chance meeting with showman [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] in an elevator the day she returned from her honeymoon.{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} She was discovered by Hollywood when starring with the road company of ''Show Boat''<ref name=\"irenedunnesite_prehollywoodyears\"/> in 1929. She signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and appeared in her first movie, ''[[Leathernecking]]'' (1930), a film version of the musical ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]''. Already in her 30s when she made her first film, she would be in competition with younger actresses for roles, and found it advantageous to evade questions that would reveal her age. Her publicists encouraged the belief that she was born in 1901 or 1904, and the former is the date engraved on her tombstone.<ref name=\"irenedunnesite_prehollywoodyears\">[http://www.irenedunnesite.com/biography/the-pre-hollywood-years-1898-1929/ The Irene Dunne Site: The Pre-Hollywood Years \u2013 1898\u20131929] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131205071729/http://www.irenedunnesite.com/biography/the-pre-hollywood-years-1898-1929/ |date=2013-12-05 }}.

''[[Love Affair (1939 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1939) is the first of three films she made opposite [[Charles Boyer]]. She starred, and sang \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\", in the [[Fred Astaire]]-[[Ginger Rogers]] film version of the musical ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935).\n[[File:IreneDunneinLoveAffair.jpg|thumb|190px|Dunne in ''Love Affair'' (1939).]]\nDunne was apprehensive about attempting her first comedy role as the title character in ''[[Theodora Goes Wild]]'' (1936), but discovered that she enjoyed it.<ref>[[Robert Osborne]], [[Turner Classic Movies]] introduction to the film.</ref> She received her second [[Best Actress]] Oscar nomination for the performance. She turned out to possess an aptitude for comedy, with a flair for combining the elegant and the madcap, a quality she displayed in such films as ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937) and ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), both co-starring [[Cary Grant]]. Other roles include Julie Gardiner Adams in ''[[Penny Serenade]]'' (1941), again with Grant, ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' (1946) as [[Anna Leonowens]], Lavinia Day in ''[[Life with Father (film)|Life with Father]]'' (1947), and Marta Hanson in ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' (1948). In ''[[The Mudlark]]'' (1950), she was nearly unrecognizable under heavy makeup as [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nThe comedy ''[[It Grows on Trees]]'' (1952) became Dunne's last screen performance, although she remained on the lookout for suitable film scripts for years afterwards.

In 1985, Dunne was given the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] for her services to the arts.\n\n==Early life==\nIrene Marie Dunn was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to Joseph John Dunn (1863\u20131909), a steamboat engineer/inspector for the United States government,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|page=7}} and Adelaide Henry (1871\u20131936), a concert pianist/music teacher from Newport, Kentucky. Dunne would later write, \"No triumph of either my stage or screen career has ever rivalled the excitement of trips down the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] on the [[riverboat]]s with my father.\" She was eleven{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} when her father died from a kidney infection;{{sfn|Gehring 2003|page=8}} she saved all of his letters and often remembered and lived by what he told her the night before he died: \"Happiness is never an accident.

On July 16, 1927, Dunne married Francis Griffin, a New York dentist,<ref>''The Indianapolis Star'', July 31, 1927, p 57</ref> whom she had met in 1924 at a supper dance in New York. Despite differing opinions and battles that raged furiously,{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} Dunne eventually agreed to marry him. Dunne later moved to Hollywood with her mother and brother and maintained a long-distance marriage with her husband in New York until he joined her in California in 1936.\n[[File:Irene Dunne with her husband.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Candid of Dunne with husband Dr. Francis Griffin.]]\nBy 1929, she had a successful Broadway career playing leading roles. Dunne's role as Magnolia Hawks in [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]'' was the result of a chance meeting with showman [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] in an elevator the day she returned from her honeymoon.{{sfn|Hats, Hunches & Happiness by Irene Dunne; 1945}} She was discovered by Hollywood when starring with the road company of ''Show Boat''<ref name=\"irenedunnesite_prehollywoodyears\"/> in 1929. She signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and appeared in her first movie, ''[[Leathernecking]]'' (1930), a film version of the musical ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]''. Already in her 30s when she made her first film, she would be in competition with younger actresses for roles, and found it advantageous to evade questions that would reveal her age. Her publicists encouraged the belief that she was born in 1901 or 1904, and the former is the date engraved on her tombstone.<ref name=\"irenedunnesite_prehollywoodyears\">[http://www.irenedunnesite.com/biography/the-pre-hollywood-years-1898-1929/ The Irene Dunne Site: The Pre-Hollywood Years \u2013 1898\u20131929] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131205071729/http://www.irenedunnesite.com/biography/the-pre-hollywood-years-1898-1929/ |date=2013-12-05 }}.

''[[Love Affair (1939 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1939) is the first of three films she made opposite [[Charles Boyer]]. She starred, and sang \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\", in the [[Fred Astaire]]-[[Ginger Rogers]] film version of the musical ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935).\n[[File:IreneDunneinLoveAffair.jpg|thumb|190px|Dunne in ''Love Affair'' (1939).]]\nDunne was apprehensive about attempting her first comedy role as the title character in ''[[Theodora Goes Wild]]'' (1936), but discovered that she enjoyed it.<ref>[[Robert Osborne]], [[Turner Classic Movies]] introduction to the film.</ref> She received her second [[Best Actress]] Oscar nomination for the performance. She turned out to possess an aptitude for comedy, with a flair for combining the elegant and the madcap, a quality she displayed in such films as ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937) and ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), both co-starring [[Cary Grant]]. Other roles include Julie Gardiner Adams in ''[[Penny Serenade]]'' (1941), again with Grant, ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' (1946) as [[Anna Leonowens]], Lavinia Day in ''[[Life with Father (film)|Life with Father]]'' (1947), and Marta Hanson in ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' (1948). In ''[[The Mudlark]]'' (1950), she was nearly unrecognizable under heavy makeup as [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nThe comedy ''[[It Grows on Trees]]'' (1952) became Dunne's last screen performance, although she remained on the lookout for suitable film scripts for years afterwards. The following year, she was the opening act on 1953's [[March of Dimes]] showcase in New York City.

When harvested as greens, fenugreek is known as ''samudra methi'' in [[Maharashtra]], especially in and around [[Mumbai]], where it is often grown in sandy tracts near the sea, hence the name ''[[samudra]]'', \"ocean\" in [[Sanskrit]]. ''Samudra methi'' is also grown in dry river beds in the [[Gangetic plain]]s. When sold as a vegetable, the young plants are harvested with their roots still attached and sold in small bundles in the markets and [[bazaar]]s. Any remaining soil is washed off to extend their [[shelf life]].\n\nIn [[Turkish cuisine]], fenugreek seeds are used for making a paste known as ''\u00e7emen''. Cumin, black pepper, and other spices are added into it, especially to make ''[[past\u0131rma]]''.  \n\nIn [[Iranian cuisine]], fenugreek leaves are called ''shanbalileh''. They are one of several greens incorporated into the herb stew ''[[ghormeh sabzi]]'', the herb frittata [[Kuku (food)|kuku sabzi]] and a soup known as ''eshkeneh''. \n\nIn [[Georgian cuisine]], a related species\u2014''[[Trigonella caerulea]]'' called \"blue fenugreek\"\u2014is used.  \n\nIn [[Egyptian cuisine]], [[fellah|peasants]] in [[Upper Egypt]] add fenugreek seeds and [[maize]] to their pita bread to produce ''[[aish merahrah]]'', a staple of their diet.
