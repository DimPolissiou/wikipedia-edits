{"title_page": "List of The Simpsons characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[File:Simpsons cast.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Some of the many recurring and regular characters in ''The Simpsons''.]]\nAlong with the [[Simpson family]], ''[[The Simpsons]]'' includes a large array of characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, and as well as fictional characters. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to creator [[Matt Groening]], the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show ''[[Second City Television]]''.<ref name=avclub>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1 |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=29 September 2008 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=26 April 2006 |newspaper=The A.V. Club}}</ref>\n\nThe main episode characters, the Simpson family, are listed first; all other characters are listed in alphabetical order. Only main, supporting, and [[recurring character]]s are listed.

cast.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Some of the many recurring and regular characters in ''The Simpsons''.]]\nAlong with the [[Simpson family]], ''[[The Simpsons]]'' includes a large array of characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, and as well as fictional characters. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to creator [[Matt Groening]], the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show ''[[Second City Television]]''.<ref name=avclub>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1 |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=29 September 2008 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=26 April 2006 |newspaper=The A.V. Club}}</ref>\n\nThe main episode characters, the Simpson family, are listed first; all other characters are listed in alphabetical order. Only main, supporting, and [[recurring character]]s are listed.

It was written by co-executive producer [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Tucker Gates]]. An edited version of the episode first aired on November 9, 2006 on [[NBC]]; later that night, a longer \"producer's cut\" edition was released, with [[deleted scene]]s edited into the full episode and broadcast on the website [[NBC.com]]. This uncut episode is the version included on the Season 3 DVD set.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, the Scranton branch has varied reactions to news that their branch will close. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) head to the CFO's house to convince him not to close it. When head of the Stamford branch [[Characters from The Office (US)#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) announces he is quitting, the employees find that the company's plans have changed.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 8.05 million viewers watched \"Branch Closing\" on its first broadcast. Critical reception to the episode was very positive, with one reviewer opining that it \"expertly combines character-driven and situational humor, while realistically presenting a major change that advances the stories of all the characters. The result is a fantastically funny, enjoyable and realistic half-hour.\"<ref name=ignreview/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!-- Per Wikipedia \"television episode\" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->\n[[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) informs [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) that the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch will close, with a few people transferred to [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and the rest [[Layoff|laid off]]. Michael takes the news badly, and soon tells the rest of the office prematurely.\n\nMichael and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) decide to confront the [[David Wallace (The Office)|CFO]] at his home. Back at the office, [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) takes this opportunity to break up with [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]), [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) tries to remember a promise that she made about sleeping with someone on the last day of work, [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) begins selling off the office equipment for profit, and [[Stanley Hudson]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) begins relishing the thought of retiring with severance.\n\nStamford branch manager [[Characters from The Office (US)#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) reveals that he has leveraged the situation to obtain a better position at [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]], throwing the restructuring into disarray. The new plan is to close Stamford instead, and Jan offers [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) the number two position in Scranton, but he is reluctant to accept it.\n\nThe Scranton branch is relieved when they hear they are saved, and Kelly is thrilled that she and Ryan do not have to break up after all. When Michael and Dwight get the news, they celebrate their success, believing, erroneously, that they accomplished it. After agonizing over the decision, Jim accepts the position and suggests to [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) that she join him in Scranton. In a talking head interview, Karen admits that even though she does not think he is \"into her,\" she is \"kind of into him\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Chip Esten 2005.jpg|right|thumb|170px|\"Branch Closing\" featured the last appearance of guest actor [[Charles Esten]].]]\n\"Branch Closing\" was written by co-executive producer [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Tucker Gates]].<ref name=episode>{{cite episode |title=Branch Closing |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Tucker Gates]] (director), [[Michael Schur]] (writer) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=November 9, 2006 |season=3 |number=7}}</ref> On her [[MySpace]] blog, actress Jenna Fischer urged readers to watch the episode, declaring that \"The stuff [Michael and Dwight] do together is the absolute funniest thing ever on our show.

It was written by co-executive producer [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Tucker Gates]]. An edited version of the episode first aired on November 9, 2006 on [[NBC]]; later that night, a longer \"producer's cut\" edition was released, with [[deleted scene]]s edited into the full episode and broadcast on the website [[NBC.com]]. This uncut episode is the version included on the Season 3 DVD set.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, the Scranton branch has varied reactions to news that their branch will close. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) head to the CFO's house to convince him not to close it. When head of the Stamford branch [[Characters from The Office (US)#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) announces he is quitting, the employees find that the company's plans have changed.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 8.05 million viewers watched \"Branch Closing\" on its first broadcast. Critical reception to the episode was very positive, with one reviewer opining that it \"expertly combines character-driven and situational humor, while realistically presenting a major change that advances the stories of all the characters. The result is a fantastically funny, enjoyable and realistic half-hour.\"<ref name=ignreview/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!-- Per Wikipedia \"television episode\" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->\n[[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) informs [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) that the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch will close, with a few people transferred to [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and the rest [[Layoff|laid off]]. Michael takes the news badly, and soon tells the rest of the office prematurely.\n\nMichael and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) decide to confront the [[David Wallace (The Office)|CFO]] at his home. Back at the office, [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) takes this opportunity to break up with [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]), [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) tries to remember a promise that she made about sleeping with someone on the last day of work, [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) begins selling off the office equipment for profit, and [[Stanley Hudson]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) begins relishing the thought of retiring with severance.\n\nStamford branch manager [[Characters from The Office (US)#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) reveals that he has leveraged the situation to obtain a better position at [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]], throwing the restructuring into disarray. The new plan is to close Stamford instead, and Jan offers [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) the number two position in Scranton, but he is reluctant to accept it.\n\nThe Scranton branch is relieved when they hear they are saved, and Kelly is thrilled that she and Ryan do not have to break up after all. When Michael and Dwight get the news, they celebrate their success, believing, erroneously, that they accomplished it. After agonizing over the decision, Jim accepts the position and suggests to [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) that she join him in Scranton. In a talking head interview, Karen admits that even though she does not think he is \"into her,\" she is \"kind of into him\".\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Chip Esten 2005.jpg|right|thumb|170px|\"Branch Closing\" featured the last appearance of guest actor [[Charles Esten]].]]\n\"Branch Closing\" was written by co-executive producer [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Tucker Gates]].<ref name=episode>{{cite episode |title=Branch Closing |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Tucker Gates]] (director), [[Michael Schur]] (writer) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=November 9, 2006 |season=3 |number=7}}</ref> On her [[MySpace]] blog, actress Jenna Fischer urged readers to watch the episode, declaring that \"The stuff [Michael and Dwight] do together is the absolute funniest thing ever on our show.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 29, 2007. The episode follows the [[Griffin family]] after [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gets a job as an organist at the local church, and she insists that the rest of the family go to church with her. This eventually leads to [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] drinking and throwing up the host during a sermon, which causes a mob to form around the Griffin household. In an attempt to prevent the town from supposedly exorcising the devil out of Stewie, the family escape and seek refuge in Texas.\n\nIt was written by series regular [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[Brian Iles]]. The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 8.13 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Bill Engvall]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and Camilla Stull, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Boys Do Cry\" was released on [[DVD]] along with four other episodes from the season on October 21, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gets a job as the new organist at the local church, which causes her to force her family to start attending mass on Sundays. After Stewie mistakes [[Eucharist|Communion]] wine for punch, he drinks too much and throws it up, leading the citizens of Quahog to believe Stewie is possessed by [[Satan]]. When the priest wants to [[exorcism|exorcise]] him, aided by everyone in town, the Griffin family escapes to Lois' sister Carol's house in [[Texas]]. Upon arriving at the home, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] fits in well with the [[cowboy]]s, but [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is disgusted by the bigotry of the local residents. Stewie, [[cross dressing|disguised as a girl]] to protect his identity, begins using the name \"Stephanie Griffin\" and, after being convinced by Lois, enters a \"Little Miss Texan\" [[beauty contest|beauty pageant]]. Meanwhile, as part of an initiation into an after-school club, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] sneak into [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford ranch]] to steal a pair of his underwear.\n\nLois soon hears that the search for Stewie has ended, but, since she was hoping to instill \"new moral values\" in her family she decides not to mention that they can go home. Later, before attending the beauty pageant that Stewie had entered, Brian finds out about the town calling off the search, from his girlfriend Jillian back in Quahog, and at the pageant tells Lois, who says she knows, which horrifies Brian. Meanwhile, after branding a cow, things turn worse when [[Petarded|Peter reveals that he is mentally retarded]]. The men with him, who explain that Texas \"[[Capital punishment in Texas|executes the retarded]]\", tie him to an electric chair, in an attempt to put him to death, but he is soon rescued by his trusty horse, revealed to be voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]]. Back at the pageant, Stewie manages to win, but when his wig falls off during the crowning ceremony, the audience labels him as a \"queer-o-sexual\" and tries to rush the stage. The family is able to escape on the back of Gottfried, and return home to Quahog. The episode ends with Lois telling Peter that moral and family values don't come from where people live or who their friends are, but from people themselves and that they should embrace their lives, while Peter says that people should be careful what they watch, and not become religious with it, while breaking the fourth wall.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright|145px|alt=A woman looking up at the camera.|[[Drew Barrymore]] provided the voice of Jillian.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and was directed by [[Brian Iles]], in his first episode for the series.<ref name=film>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/boys-do-cry/episode/132168/castcrew;_ylt=An5MG4EZ1gHj5hps1LPkSZa9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Boys do Cry|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]] served as supervising directors.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 29, 2007. The episode follows the [[Griffin family]] after [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gets a job as an organist at the local church, and she insists that the rest of the family go to church with her. This eventually leads to [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] drinking and throwing up the host during a sermon, which causes a mob to form around the Griffin household. In an attempt to prevent the town from supposedly exorcising the devil out of Stewie, the family escape and seek refuge in Texas.\n\nIt was written by series regular [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[Brian Iles]]. The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 8.13 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Bill Engvall]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and Camilla Stull, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Boys Do Cry\" was released on [[DVD]] along with four other episodes from the season on October 21, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] gets a job as the new organist at the local church, which causes her to force her family to start attending mass on Sundays. After Stewie mistakes [[Eucharist|Communion]] wine for punch, he drinks too much and throws it up, leading the citizens of Quahog to believe Stewie is possessed by [[Satan]]. When the priest wants to [[exorcism|exorcise]] him, aided by everyone in town, the Griffin family escapes to Lois' sister Carol's house in [[Texas]]. Upon arriving at the home, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] fits in well with the [[cowboy]]s, but [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is disgusted by the bigotry of the local residents. Stewie, [[cross dressing|disguised as a girl]] to protect his identity, begins using the name \"Stephanie Griffin\" and, after being convinced by Lois, enters a \"Little Miss Texan\" [[beauty contest|beauty pageant]]. Meanwhile, as part of an initiation into an after-school club, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] sneak into [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford ranch]] to steal a pair of his underwear.\n\nLois soon hears that the search for Stewie has ended, but, since she was hoping to instill \"new moral values\" in her family she decides not to mention that they can go home. Later, before attending the beauty pageant that Stewie had entered, Brian finds out about the town calling off the search, from his girlfriend Jillian back in Quahog, and at the pageant tells Lois, who says she knows, which horrifies Brian. Meanwhile, after branding a cow, things turn worse when [[Petarded|Peter reveals that he is mentally retarded]]. The men with him, who explain that Texas \"[[Capital punishment in Texas|executes the retarded]]\", tie him to an electric chair, in an attempt to put him to death, but he is soon rescued by his trusty horse, revealed to be voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]]. Back at the pageant, Stewie manages to win, but when his wig falls off during the crowning ceremony, the audience labels him as a \"queer-o-sexual\" and tries to rush the stage. The family is able to escape on the back of Gottfried, and return home to Quahog. The episode ends with Lois telling Peter that moral and family values don't come from where people live or who their friends are, but from people themselves and that they should embrace their lives, while Peter says that people should be careful what they watch, and not become religious with it, while breaking the fourth wall.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright|145px|alt=A woman looking up at the camera.|[[Drew Barrymore]] provided the voice of Jillian.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and was directed by [[Brian Iles]], in his first episode for the series.<ref name=film>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/boys-do-cry/episode/132168/castcrew;_ylt=An5MG4EZ1gHj5hps1LPkSZa9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Boys do Cry|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]] served as supervising directors.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 23, 2007. The episode is a retelling and [[parody]] of the 1977 blockbuster film, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', recasting the show's characters into ''Star Wars'' roles. The plot follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] as he retells the story of ''Star Wars'' while the electricity is out in their house.\n\nIt was written by [[Alec Sulkin]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]]. To produce the installment the staff asked [[Lucasfilm]], the company who owns the rights to the ''Star Wars'' franchise, for permission. ''Blue Harvest'' guest starred [[Chevy Chase]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Mick Hucknall]], and [[Rush Limbaugh]]. The episode also included recurring voice actors [[Lori Alan]], [[Adam West]], [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[John Viener]], [[Steve Callaghan]], [[Kirker Butler]], [[Mark Hentemann]], [[Johnny Brennan]], [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]], [[Phil LaMarr]], and [[Wally Wingert]].  It was viewed by 10.86 million viewers on its original broadcast and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the [[Griffin family|Griffins]] are watching television, the power goes out and they are left with no other form of entertainment. While they wait for the power to return, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to retell the story of ''Star Wars'' beginning with \"Part IV.\"\n\nA [[Tantive IV|Rebel ship]] is captured by a [[Star Destroyer]]. On the ship are the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]]s [[C-3PO]] ([[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]), [[R2-D2]] ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]) and the rebel leader [[Princess Leia]] ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]). While the ship is boarded by [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]]s, Leia tries to send an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is captured by [[Darth Vader]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) while R2 and 3PO flee to [[Tatooine]] in an escape pod, where they are captured by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]]s.\n\nThe droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers, whose nephew [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) wishes to join the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebellion]] and fight the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him, but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them ([[List of Family Guy characters#Pawtucket Brewery|Opie]]) and is found by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the [[Death Star]], which must be sent to her father on her home planet of [[Alderaan]] and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of [[the Force]] and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own [[lightsaber]]. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed.\n\nLuke, Obi-Wan, and the droids travel to [[Mos Eisley]] to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan. At a local cantina, they hire smuggler [[Han Solo]] (Peter) and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]), who agree to take them with their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Adam West (Family Guy)|Adam West]]) has Alderaan destroyed. The ''Millennium Falcon'' exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the ''Falcon'', taking the couch with them.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' journeys to the Rebel base at [[Yavin IV]], where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters (who also include [[Simply Red]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Red Buttons]], the ''[[Red October (submarine)|Red October]]'' and an anthropomorphic pack of [[Big Red (gum)|Big Red]] gum) attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, and is about to fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the ''Falcon'' and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.\n\nBack at the Griffins' home, Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on. Everyone thanks Peter for keeping them entertained, although Chris points out that ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' already told [[Robot Chicken: Star Wars|that story]]. Peter dismisses and mocks the show, and Chris storms off.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=A man with black hair, and tan skin with a black shirt on, leans forward while laughing into a microphone.|''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] served as executive producer for the episode.]]\n\"Blue Harvest\" originally aired on September 23, 2007, as the premiere for the [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''Family Guy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew;_ylt=ApqUwltmQ..ERF8wJh8qBou9v9EF|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|title=Family Guy: Petarded|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=yah/> The episode was written by [[Alec Sulkin]], who has been with the show since the fourth season.<ref name=yah/> It was directed by series veteran [[Dominic Polcino]], who has been directing for the series since its first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/i-never-met-the-dead-man/episode/1545|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|title=Family Guy: Chitty Chitty Death Bang|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]] served as supervising directors.<ref name=yah/> The episode's music was composed by Walter Murphy.<ref name=yah>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/blue-harvest-part-2/episode/146691;_ylt=AgVs4bzNT7h1XQOYwR33KJOvo9EF|title=Family Guy: Blue Harvest, Part 1|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] explained that the reason they made a parody of ''Star Wars'' in particular was because the show's staff members were huge fans of the films.<ref name=la/> They also chose ''Star Wars'' because [[Lucasfilm]] allowed it.<ref name=la/> MacFarlane stated that creating parodies based on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' or ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' was originally considered, but they assumed they would be unable to gain permission from the owners of those properties (in this case [[Paramount Pictures]]).<ref name=la/> Lucasfilm only gave the show's staff one condition, which was that the characters had to look exactly like they do in the movies.<ref name=la>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/27/entertainment/la-ca-conversation27-2009dec27|title=Q & A with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Collins, Scott|date=December 27, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nClips of the episode were shown to audience members at [[Star Wars Celebration|''Star Wars'' Celebration]] IV, where a panel was hosted by MacFarlane, Sulkin and Polcino, and executive producer [[David A.

first part of the series' trilogy ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy|Laugh It Up, Fuzzball]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 23, 2007. The episode is a retelling and [[parody]] of the 1977 blockbuster film, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', recasting the show's characters into ''Star Wars'' roles. The plot follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] as he retells the story of ''Star Wars'' while the electricity is out in their house.\n\nIt was written by [[Alec Sulkin]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]]. To produce the installment the staff asked [[Lucasfilm]], the company who owns the rights to the ''Star Wars'' franchise, for permission. ''Blue Harvest'' guest starred [[Chevy Chase]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Mick Hucknall]], and [[Rush Limbaugh]]. The episode also included recurring voice actors [[Lori Alan]], [[Adam West]], [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[John Viener]], [[Steve Callaghan]], [[Kirker Butler]], [[Mark Hentemann]], [[Johnny Brennan]], [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]], [[Phil LaMarr]], and [[Wally Wingert]].  It was viewed by 10.86 million viewers on its original broadcast and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the [[Griffin family|Griffins]] are watching television, the power goes out and they are left with no other form of entertainment. While they wait for the power to return, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to retell the story of ''Star Wars'' beginning with \"Part IV.\"\n\nA [[Tantive IV|Rebel ship]] is captured by a [[Star Destroyer]]. On the ship are the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]]s [[C-3PO]] ([[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]), [[R2-D2]] ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]) and the rebel leader [[Princess Leia]] ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]). While the ship is boarded by [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]]s, Leia tries to send an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is captured by [[Darth Vader]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) while R2 and 3PO flee to [[Tatooine]] in an escape pod, where they are captured by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]]s.\n\nThe droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers, whose nephew [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) wishes to join the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebellion]] and fight the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him, but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them ([[List of Family Guy characters#Pawtucket Brewery|Opie]]) and is found by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the [[Death Star]], which must be sent to her father on her home planet of [[Alderaan]] and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of [[the Force]] and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own [[lightsaber]]. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed.\n\nLuke, Obi-Wan, and the droids travel to [[Mos Eisley]] to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan. At a local cantina, they hire smuggler [[Han Solo]] (Peter) and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]), who agree to take them with their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Adam West (Family Guy)|Adam West]]) has Alderaan destroyed. The ''Millennium Falcon'' exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the ''Falcon'', taking the couch with them.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' journeys to the Rebel base at [[Yavin IV]], where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters (who also include [[Simply Red]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Red Buttons]], the ''[[Red October (submarine)|Red October]]'' and an anthropomorphic pack of [[Big Red (gum)|Big Red]] gum) attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, and is about to fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the ''Falcon'' and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.\n\nBack at the Griffins' home, Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on.

Although [[Eddie Albert]] returned to play Jason O'Day from the original 1975 movie, the parts of Tony and Tia were recast with actors comparable in age to [[Ike Eisenmann]] and [[Kim Richards]] when they first played the parts. [[Tracey Gold]] from ''[[Growing Pains]]'' played Tia, and Andy Freeman played Tony. The parts of Aristotle Bolt, Lucas Deranian and Uncle Ben\u00e9 were also recast.\n\n''Beyond Witch Mountain'' was broadcast on [[CBS]] as an episode of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney]]'' on February 20, 1982. It was originally intended to be the pilot for a television series, but no networks thought that viewers would take the show seriously, and so a second episode was never made.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe film totally contradicts and ignores the 1978 sequel ''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]'', because in that film, Tia and Tony are of teenage years, Uncle Ben\u00e9 is still alive, and in both of the original movies, Tony had to answer Tia verbally\u2014he did not have the power to talk through his mind.  In ''Beyond Witch Mountain'', Tia and Tony are around the same age from the first movie, Uncle Ben\u00e9 dies early in the film, and as previously mentioned, Tony can talk to Tia mentally.\n\n== Plot ==\nTia and Tony follow their Uncle Bene as he leaves the Witch Mountain colony. As they catch up to him in the woods, Deranian and Foreman, henchmen of billionaire Aristotle Bolt, shoot tranquilizer darts toward the trio in an attempt to capture the children. Bene reverses the darts in mid air, and one strikes Foreman as Deranian runs from the scene.\nTia and Tony learn that Bene has left the colony in search of his long lost grandson. In a vision, Bene discovered that his grandson, Gregory, also a survivor from their lost world, used his telekinetic powers to move a log across a river to save drowning children. Bene first encourages Tia and Tony to return to the safety of Witch Mountain, but they insist that they can help and Bene concedes. Tia, Tony and Bene set up camp in the woods for the night, and they begin to visualize a cabin, which they draw in the dirt with a stick. Bene finally reveals to the children that his time on Earth has come to an end. As he passes away and his body evaporates, he tells the children to go to the cabin to seek help in finding Gregory.\n\nThe next morning, Tia ascertains that the cabin belonged to Jason O\u2019Day. They reunite with Jason, who reluctantly agrees to help them in finding Gregory and bringing him home to Witch Mountain, after Tony reveals that Bolt is again pursuing them. The children are also reunited with Winkie, Tia\u2019s black cat, who she entrusted to Jason at the end of ''Escape''.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolt, now aware that the children have left their secret colony, sends Deranian to bring Jason to him, in an attempt to lure the children to Bolt. When Jason and the children are briefly separated on a shopping trip, Jason is held up at gunpoint by Deranian and Foreman and forced to drive to Bolt\u2019s estate. Winkie leaps out of the window of Jason\u2019s camper, and telepathically informs Tia of Jason\u2019s plight.\n\nJason, meanwhile, is drugged by Bolt in an attempt to gain information about the children, and Jason inadvertently reveals that he has been in contact with the children. The children hitchhike their way to Bolt\u2019s estate to rescue Jason. Using their telekinetic powers, they cause a commotion inside the home which allows them the opportunity to escape with Jason. The trio successfully escapes from Bolt in time to retrieve Gregory from a hospital where he has been under observation. Tia and Tony teach Gregory about their people, and the colony of Witch Mountain, and Gregory happily agrees to be returned to his people, having already had visions of his impeding rescue.\n\nJason brings Tia, Tony and Gregory to the woods near Witch Mountain.

Although [[Eddie Albert]] returned to play Jason O'Day from the original 1975 movie, the parts of Tony and Tia were recast with actors comparable in age to [[Ike Eisenmann]] and [[Kim Richards]] when they first played the parts. [[Tracey Gold]] from ''[[Growing Pains]]'' played Tia, and Andy Freeman played Tony. The parts of Aristotle Bolt, Lucas Deranian and Uncle Ben\u00e9 were also recast.\n\n''Beyond Witch Mountain'' was broadcast on [[CBS]] as an episode of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney]]'' on February 20, 1982. It was originally intended to be the pilot for a television series, but no networks thought that viewers would take the show seriously, and so a second episode was never made.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe film totally contradicts and ignores the 1978 sequel ''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]'', because in that film, Tia and Tony are of teenage years, Uncle Ben\u00e9 is still alive, and in both of the original movies, Tony had to answer Tia verbally\u2014he did not have the power to talk through his mind.  In ''Beyond Witch Mountain'', Tia and Tony are around the same age from the first movie, Uncle Ben\u00e9 dies early in the film, and as previously mentioned, Tony can talk to Tia mentally.\n\n== Plot ==\nTia and Tony follow their Uncle Bene as he leaves the Witch Mountain colony. As they catch up to him in the woods, Deranian and Foreman, henchmen of billionaire Aristotle Bolt, shoot tranquilizer darts toward the trio in an attempt to capture the children. Bene reverses the darts in mid air, and one strikes Foreman as Deranian runs from the scene.\nTia and Tony learn that Bene has left the colony in search of his long lost grandson. In a vision, Bene discovered that his grandson, Gregory, also a survivor from their lost world, used his telekinetic powers to move a log across a river to save drowning children. Bene first encourages Tia and Tony to return to the safety of Witch Mountain, but they insist that they can help and Bene concedes. Tia, Tony and Bene set up camp in the woods for the night, and they begin to visualize a cabin, which they draw in the dirt with a stick. Bene finally reveals to the children that his time on Earth has come to an end. As he passes away and his body evaporates, he tells the children to go to the cabin to seek help in finding Gregory. \n\nThe next morning, Tia ascertains that the cabin belonged to Jason O\u2019Day. They reunite with Jason, who reluctantly agrees to help them in finding Gregory and bringing him home to Witch Mountain, after Tony reveals that Bolt is again pursuing them. The children are also reunited with Winkie, Tia\u2019s black cat, who she entrusted to Jason at the end of ''Escape''. \n\nMeanwhile, Bolt, now aware that the children have left their secret colony, sends Deranian to bring Jason to him, in an attempt to lure the children to Bolt. When Jason and the children are briefly separated on a shopping trip, Jason is held up at gunpoint by Deranian and Foreman and forced to drive to Bolt\u2019s estate. Winkie leaps out of the window of Jason\u2019s camper, and telepathically informs Tia of Jason\u2019s plight. \n\nJason, meanwhile, is drugged by Bolt in an attempt to gain information about the children, and Jason inadvertently reveals that he has been in contact with the children. The children hitchhike their way to Bolt\u2019s estate to rescue Jason. Using their telekinetic powers, they cause a commotion inside the home which allows them the opportunity to escape with Jason. The trio successfully escapes from Bolt in time to retrieve Gregory from a hospital where he has been under observation. Tia and Tony teach Gregory about their people, and the colony of Witch Mountain, and Gregory happily agrees to be returned to his people, having already had visions of his impeding rescue.\n\nJason brings Tia, Tony and Gregory to the woods near Witch Mountain.

Written by [[Mindy Kaling]], who also acts in the show as [[Kelly Kapoor]], and directed by [[Randall Einhorn]], the episode first aired in the [[United States]] on February 1, 2007, on [[NBC]].  \"Ben Franklin\" received 5.0/13 in the ages 18\u201349&nbsp;[[demographic]] of the [[Nielsen ratings]], and was watched by an estimated audience of 10.1&nbsp;million viewers,<ref name=\"Tan\"/> and the episode received mixed reviews among critics.\n\nIn the episode, the employees from the office prepare for [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis Lapin]]'s ([[Phyllis Smith]]) wedding. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), acting under advice from [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]), instructs [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to hire a stripper for the men and delegates [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) to hire one for the women. While Dwight hires a stripper, Jim ends up hiring a [[Ben Franklin]] impersonator ([[Andy Daly]]) instead.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe office plays host to a bridal shower for [[Phyllis Lapin]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) while [[Bob Vance (fictional character)|Bob Vance's]] ([[Robert R. Shafer]]) bachelor party is held in the warehouse. Though [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is aware that the company's [[sexual harassment]] policy forbids strippers in the workplace, [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) convinces him that it is okay to hire a stripper for the bachelor party if he also gets a male stripper for the bridal shower. After [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) admitted to [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) in the previous episode that he still has feelings for [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), interactions between the three become increasingly tense.\n\nMichael delegates the hiring of the strippers to [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and Jim. While Dwight locates [[List of The Office (American TV series) characters#Elizabeth|a stripper named Elizabeth]] (Jackie Debatin) for Bob Vance's party, Jim orders an educational [[Benjamin Franklin]] impersonator ([[Andy Daly]]) as a joke. Pam and Karen have fun gently heckling the impersonator. Jim tells Dwight that the impersonator is the real Ben Franklin. Dwight says he's \"99% sure\" this is not so but asks questions to the impersonator that he believes only the real Ben Franklin would know, such as who was the King of Austria ([[Joseph II of Austria|Joseph II]]) and who was the King of Prussia ([[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]]). The well-practiced impersonator answers each question correctly without hesitation, much to Dwight's anger and disbelief. In the break room, Karen confronts Pam about [[Casino Night|Jim and Pam's kiss]] and asks if she is still interested in Jim. Made nervous by the questioning, Pam uses misleading wording, babbles uncontrollably, and at the end of the conversation blurts out \"I'm sorry.\" Karen finds her behavior baffling but not suspicious.\n\nAt the bachelor party, Bob Vance refuses a [[lap dance]], so Michael volunteers. During the lap dance, Michael becomes concerned that this is cheating on [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) and brings the show to an abrupt close. Dwight decides to get the three hours of work they paid the stripper for by having her answer calls. After consulting with \"Ben Franklin\" and the stripper, Michael decides to tell Jan about the lap dance. However, Jan is less upset by his unfaithfulness to her than by his violation of company policy. Relieved, Michael makes lovey dovey talk to Jan even as she suggests firing him over the incident.\n\nThe Benjamin Franklin impersonator flirts with Pam at her desk. Jim hears about this and teasingly asks if things are getting serious. This makes Pam embarrassed by her lack of a boyfriend, and she asks [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J.
