Police find evidence of narcotics being used by the cyclists and it is revealed that UCI president Ditmer Klerken ([[Kevin Bacon]]) accepted bribes of $50,000 each from a majority of the competitors to forego preliminary drug testing. Although all the cyclists are suspected of doping, the UCI allows the Tour to continue with the five competitors who didn't pay off Klerken: Peppi, American-born Nigerian cyclist Marty Hass ([[Andy Samberg]]), who is resented by Nigeria for being the one to represent the country, French cyclist Adrian Baton ([[Freddie Highmore]]), who is secretly a woman named Adrianna Baton disguised as a man so she can compete, African-American cyclist Slim Robinson ([[Daveed Diggs]]), nephew of [[Jackie Robinson]] who wants to break the color barrier in cycling like Jackie did in baseball, and Austrian cyclist Gustav Ditters ([[John Cena]]), who had gained a considerable amount of muscle mass from the previous year due to steroids.\n\nBefore resuming the race, the five agree to take turns at the front so everyone else can [[Drafting (aerodynamics)#Cycling|draft]] to conserve their energy before the finish line. However, when the race resumes, no one is willing to ride up front, so the cyclists attempt to go as slowly as possible to conserve their energy. This allows Robinson to enjoy the scenery and he eventually leaves the race with a female spectator to become the first black French dairy farmer. Before the end of the day, Ditters is taunted by a spectator for being unable to go fast. When the race resumes ten days later, an enraged Ditters goes as fast as possible to win the day, much to the shock of observers. Believing he had used enhancements, police raid his apartment and find that he had been doping himself with cheetah's blood, which gets Ditters disqualified. When the race resumes, Peppi dies when he overexerts himself, causing his heart to explode within his chest, and falls off a cliff.\n\nHass and Baton are the only competitors left, but they end up becoming attracted to each other and pause the race to go have sex in the woods. Hass finds out Baton's true identity and agrees to keep it a secret, which inadvertently turns him into a gay sports icon. When they resume the race, they tie their bicycles together to make sure they both win simultaneously. On the final day of the race, BBC reporter Rex Honeycut ([[James Marsden]]), who had ridden alongside the competitors for real time interviews during the race, is told that because he had ridden all laps of the race and registered to ride on the Tour, he is eligible to win the Tour de France and makes an attempt to do so.

Police find evidence of narcotics being used by the cyclists and it is revealed that UCI president Ditmer Klerken ([[Kevin Bacon]]) accepted bribes of $50,000 each from a majority of the competitors to forego preliminary drug testing. Although all the cyclists are suspected of doping, the UCI allows the Tour to continue with the five competitors who didn't pay off Klerken: Peppi, American-born Nigerian cyclist Marty Hass ([[Andy Samberg]]), who is resented by Nigeria for being the one to represent the country, French cyclist Adrian Baton ([[Freddie Highmore]]), who is secretly a woman named Adrianna Baton disguised as a man so she can compete, African-American cyclist Slim Robinson ([[Daveed Diggs]]), nephew of [[Jackie Robinson]] who wants to break the color barrier in cycling like Jackie did in baseball, and Austrian cyclist Gustav Ditters ([[John Cena]]), who had gained a considerable amount of muscle mass from the previous year due to steroids.\n\nBefore resuming the race, the five agree to take turns at the front so everyone else can [[Drafting (aerodynamics)#Cycling|draft]] to conserve their energy before the finish line. However, when the race resumes, no one is willing to ride up front, so the cyclists attempt to go as slowly as possible to conserve their energy. This allows Robinson to enjoy the scenery and he eventually leaves the race with a female spectator to become the first black French dairy farmer. Before the end of the day, Ditters is taunted by a spectator for being unable to go fast. When the race resumes ten days later, an enraged Ditters goes as fast as possible to win the day, much to the shock of observers. Believing he had used enhancements, police raid his apartment and find that he had been doping himself with cheetah's blood, which gets Ditters disqualified. When the race resumes, Peppi dies when he overexerts himself, causing his heart to explode within his chest, and falls off a cliff.\n\nHass and Baton are the only competitors left, but they end up becoming attracted to each other and pause the race to go have sex in the woods. Hass finds out Baton's true identity and agrees to keep it a secret, which inadvertently turns him into a gay sports icon. When they resume the race, they tie their bicycles together to make sure they both win simultaneously. On the final day of the race, BBC reporter Rex Honeycut ([[James Marsden]]), who had ridden alongside the competitors for real time interviews during the race, is told that because he had ridden all laps of the race and registered to ride on the Tour, he is eligible to win the Tour de France and makes an attempt to do so. Baton detaches from Hass and jumps at Honeycut, knocking him to the ground so Hass can win the race. Honeycut is shown to have motorized his bicycle to keep up with the cyclists. Baton's true identity is exposed and is sent to 35 years in prison for manslaughter as Honeycut had been accidentally killed during the scuffle.\n\nHass looks set to win the Tour de France until Robinson, who had missed the thrill of cycling, rushes out to the front and wins the race by 73 feet. Robinson relishes being the first African-American to excel at cycling like his uncle did at baseball, while Hass laments that Baton's sacrifice was in vain.\n\nPresent day interviews are conducted with Hass ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), Baton ([[Julia Ormond]]), Robinson ([[Danny Glover]]), and Ditters ([[Dolph Lundgren]]), along with other outside observers including disgraced cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] who insists on remaining anonymous.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Marty Hass, Nigerian cyclist\n** [[Jeff Goldblum]] as current-day Marty Hass\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as JuJu Peppi, Italian cyclist\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Adrian Baton, French cyclist\n** [[Julia Ormond]] as current-day Adrian Baton aka Adrianna Baton\n* [[Daveed Diggs]] as Slim Robinson, American cyclist and nephew of [[Jackie Robinson]] (fictionally)\n** [[Danny Glover]] as current-day Slim Robinson\n* [[John Cena]] as Gustav Ditters, Austrian cyclist\n** [[Dolph Lundgren]] as current-day Gustav Ditters\n* [[James Marsden]] as Rex Honeycut, a BBC reporter \n* [[Will Forte]] as a French police officer investigating an [[amphetamine]]-laced water bottle\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Lucy Flerng, editor-in-chief of ''Cycling Enthusiast Magazine''\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Ditmer Klerken, former president of UCI\n* [[Phylicia Rashad]] as Victoria Young, an animator\n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as Olusegun Okorocha, Marty's childhood neighbor\n* [[Nathan Fielder]] as Stu Ruckman, current head of the World Anti-Doping Agency\n* [[Chris Romano|Chris \"Romanski\" Romano]] as Jabin Dolchey, the steroid aggressive cyclist \n* [[Jon Hamm]] as the narrator\n* [[Edgar Wright]] as the British sports commentator \n* [[J.

Loosely based on [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (novel)|the 1973 novel of the same name]] by [[Lois Duncan]] and is the first installment in [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (film series)|''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' trilogy]]. The film centers on four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they killed a man. The film also draws inspiration from the [[urban legend]] known as [[the Hook]].\n\nAfter having written ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (released the year prior), Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan's source novel by producer [[Erik Feig]]. Where Williamson's screenplay for ''Scream'' contained prominent elements of [[satire]] and self-referentiality, his adaptation of ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' reworked the novel's central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=183}} Shot on location in California and [[North Carolina]] in the spring of 1997, ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was released theatrically in North America on October 17, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing $125 million worldwide on a budget of $17 million, and remaining number 1 at the U.S. [[box office]] for three consecutive weeks. It was also nominated for and won multiple awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/awards |title=I Know What You Did Last Summer - Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998) and ''[[I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (2006). ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' has also been parodied and referenced in popular culture,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wayans Brothers' Comedy Style A Hit In 'Scary Movie' |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |volume=98 |page=58 |date=August 14, 2000}}</ref> and credited alongside ''Scream'' with revitalizing the [[slasher film|slasher genre]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Shary|2012|p=62}}\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[Fourth of July]] in [[Southport, North Carolina]], Julie James and her friends Ray Bronson, Helen Shivers, and Barry Cox drive to the beach after attending a party. While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never discuss the incident again.\n\nA year later, Julie returns home from her college in [[Boston]] for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, \"I know what you did last summer!\" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max as he was the only person there that night. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook, even though Max claims he has no idea what Barry is talking about. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a [[raincoat|rain slicker]] wielding the same hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker saying, \"I know.\" He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car.\n\nMeanwhile, as Ray still suspects Max, Julie researches newspaper articles which lead her to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off most of her hair while she sleeps, and writes \"Soon\" in lipstick on her vanity mirror.\n\nThe following morning, Julie finds Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of her car. When she calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.\n\nAt the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry. The officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, despite defending herself, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade.\n\nJulie finds an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis, and realizes that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She then goes to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe her. Julie notices Ray's boat is called ''Billy Blue'' and runs away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites Julie to hide on his boat. On the boat, she finds photos and articles about her friends and her, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie, chasing her below deck; there, she uncovers the bodies of Helen and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie. He ultimately uses the [[rigging]] to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When Julie and Ray are questioned by the police, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anyone the previous summer, and reconcile.\n\nA year later, Julie is in college in [[Boston]]. As she enters the shower, she notices the words \"I still know\" on the mirror. Moments later, the fisherman crashes through it as Julie screams in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as Julie James\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Helen Shivers\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Barry Cox\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Ray Bronson\n* [[Bridgette Wilson]] as Elsa Shivers\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Missy Egan\n* [[Muse Watson]] as Ben Willis/The Fisherman\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Max Neurick\n* [[Stuart Greer]] as Officer Caporizo\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was a screenplay penned by Kevin Williamson several years beforehand, which was then rushed into production by Columbia Pictures upon the success of the Williamson-written ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.moviefone.com/2017/10/17/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-movie-trivia/| title=14 Things You Never Know About 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'| author=Susman, Gary|work=MovieFone| date=October 17, 2017| access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref> It was based on the [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (novel)|1973 novel of the same name]] by [[Lois Duncan]],{{sfn|Fahy|2010|p=248}} a youth-oriented suspense novel about four young people who are involved in a [[hit-and-run]] accident involving a young boy.<ref name=now/> Producer [[Erik Feig]] pitched the idea of a screen adaptation to [[Mandalay Entertainment]], and subsequently appointed Williamson to retool the core elements of Duncan's novel, rendering a screenplay more akin to a 1980s [[slasher film]].{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=26}}<ref name=now>{{cite av media|people=Gillis, Michael (prod., dir.)|medium=Documentary short|title=Now I Know What You Did Last Summer|year=2008|format=Blu-ray|work=I Know What You Did Last Summer|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment}}</ref> Inspired by his father, who had been a commercial fisherman, Williamson changed the setting of the novel to a small fishing village, and made the villain a hook-wielding fisherman.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=183}}\n\nThe killer's arming of himself with a hook is a reference to the [[urban legend]] \"[[The Hook]],\" which the four main characters recount at the beginning of the film around a campfire.<ref name=now/> According to Williamson, he wrote the scene as a way of indicating what was to come: \"Basically what I was doing was I was setting the framework to say, 'All right, audience: That's that legend.

However, he contends that it is a \"much different film,\" even in spite of the fact that their respective screenplays were penned by the same writer:\n\n{{quote|Whereas ''Scream'' relied heavily on self-conscious references and its pop culture veneer, ''Last Summer'' was a throwback to the slasher films of the early '80s. While, like ''Scream'', it employed the services of a group of young, sexy and almost impossibly good-looking actors, ''Last Summer'' played its horror straight. Those looking for a good old-fashioned slasher film were pleasantly surprised.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=182}} }}\n\nModern reception has continued to be mixed and on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 42% approval rating, based on reviews from 66 critics.

Loosely based on [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (novel)|the 1973 novel of the same name]] by [[Lois Duncan]] and is the first installment in [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (film series)|''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' trilogy]]. The film centers on four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they killed a man. The film also draws inspiration from the [[urban legend]] known as [[the Hook]].\n\nAfter having written ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (released the year prior), Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan's source novel by producer [[Erik Feig]]. Where Williamson's screenplay for ''Scream'' contained prominent elements of [[satire]] and self-referentiality, his adaptation of ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' reworked the novel's central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=183}} Shot on location in California and [[North Carolina]] in the spring of 1997, ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was released theatrically in North America on October 17, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing $125 million worldwide on a budget of $17 million, and remaining number 1 at the U.S. [[box office]] for three consecutive weeks. It was also nominated for and won multiple awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/awards |title=I Know What You Did Last Summer - Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998) and ''[[I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (2006). ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' has also been parodied and referenced in popular culture,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wayans Brothers' Comedy Style A Hit In 'Scary Movie' |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |volume=98 |page=58 |date=August 14, 2000}}</ref> and credited alongside ''Scream'' with revitalizing the [[slasher film|slasher genre]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Shary|2012|p=62}}\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[Fourth of July]] in [[Southport, North Carolina]], Julie James and her friends Ray Bronson, Helen Shivers, and Barry Cox drive to the beach after attending a party. While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never discuss the incident again.\n\nA year later, Julie returns home from her college in [[Boston]] for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, \"I know what you did last summer!\" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max as he was the only person there that night. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook, even though Max claims he has no idea what Barry is talking about. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a [[raincoat|rain slicker]] wielding the same hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker saying, \"I know.\" He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car.\n\nMeanwhile, as Ray still suspects Max, Julie researches newspaper articles which lead her to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off most of her hair while she sleeps, and writes \"Soon\" in lipstick on her vanity mirror.\n\nThe following morning, Julie finds Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of her car. When she calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.\n\nAt the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry. The officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade.\n\nJulie finds an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis, and realizes that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She then goes to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe her. Julie notices Ray's boat is called ''Billy Blue'' and runs away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites Julie to hide on his boat. On the boat, she finds photos and articles about her friends and her, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie, chasing her below deck; there, she uncovers the bodies of Helen and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie. He ultimately uses the [[rigging]] to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When Julie and Ray are questioned by the police, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anyone the previous summer, and reconcile.\n\nA year later, Julie is in college in [[Boston]].

Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce [[glycoalkaloids]] in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.<ref name=\"fried\">{{cite journal|author=Mendel Friedman, Gary M.

Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic [[alkaloid]] [[solanine]] and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \"true potato seed\", \"TPS\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be [[vegetative propagation|propagated vegetatively]] by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.\n\n== Genetics ==\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species.

Solanine is found in other plants in the same family, [[Solanaceae]], which includes such plants as deadly nightshade (''[[Atropa belladonna]]''), henbane (''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') and tobacco (''[[Nicotiana|Nicotiana spp.]]''), as well as the food plants [[eggplant]] and [[tomato]]. These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the tubers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}</ref> In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh. (The glycoalkaloid content was, in order from highest to lowest: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin{{Clarify|reason=skin of what|date=August 2018}}, roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh.)<ref name=fried/>\n\nExposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber.<ref name=\"Greening of potatoes\"/> Cooking at high temperatures\u2014over {{convert|170|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\u2014partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in [[Solanum jamesii|wild potatoes]] is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, [[diarrhea]], [[cramps]], and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.\n\nDifferent potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The [[Lenape (potato)|Lenape]] variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids.<ref name=\"boing\">{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2013/03/25/the-case-of-the-poison-potato.html|title=The case of the poison potato|publisher=boingboing.net|author=Marggie Koerth-Baker|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> Since then, breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]].

To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the US, this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potatoesusa.com/potato-products/seed-potatoes |title=United States Potato Board -Seed Potatoes|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> These locations are selected for their cold, hard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth.

During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, [[photosynthesis]] begins as the plant develops leaves and branches above-ground and [[stolon]]s develop from lower leaf [[axil]]s on the below-ground stem. In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell forming new [[tubers]] and the shoots continue to grow and flowers typically develop soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal [[soil moisture]] and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to [[Pest (organism)|pest attacks]]. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the [[Plant sugars|sugars]] in the tubers convert to starches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potatoes Home Garden |url=https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/lawn-and-garden/potatoes-home-garden/ |website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu |publisher=UF/IFAS Extension |accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JefferiesLawson1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Jefferies|first1=R.

Commercial growers cover them by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (called \"hilling\" up, or in British English \"earthing up\").

Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are [[roguing|rogued]] in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.\n\nPotatoes are sensitive to heavy [[frost]]s, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.\n\n=== Pests ===\n{{Main|List of potato diseases}}\nThe historically significant ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe<ref name=\"PlDis2011\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njf.nu/filebank/files/20060330$fil$vodD3dJE390Hb92eKsGd.pdf|title=NJF seminar No. 388 Integrated Control of Potato Late Blight in the Nordic and Baltic Countries.

In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large [[potato harvester]]s, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.\n\nImmature potatoes may be sold as \"creamer potatoes\"{{anchor|creamer potatoes|new potatoes}} and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by \"grabbling\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested before it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a [[Yukon Gold potato]] or a red potato, called gold creamers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/fresh-direct/gold-creamer-potato|title=Calories in Fresh Direct Gold Creamer Potato|publisher=The Daily Plate, LLC|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"recipe tips\">{{cite web|url=http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--35863/creamer-potato.asp|title=Creamer Potato|publisher=recipetips.com|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high in moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of [[starch]] than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared by boiling, baking, frying, and roasting.<ref name=\"recipe tips\" /> Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \"new potatoes\"{{anchor|new potato}}, which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the same varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Randal|first=Oulton|date=24 July 2006|title=Creamer Potatoes|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/creamer-potatoes|website=CooksInfo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPotatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.<ref>Kleinkopf G.E. and N. Olsen. 2003.

The only requirement involves cooking to swell the starch granules. Most potato dishes are served hot but some are first cooked, then served cold, notably [[potato salad]] and [[potato chip|potato chips (crisps)]].

Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce [[glycoalkaloids]] in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.<ref name=\"fried\">{{cite journal|author=Mendel Friedman, Gary M.

The word has an unknown origin and was originally ({{circa|1440}}) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to the Latin {{lang|la|spad-}} a word root meaning \"sword\"; compare Spanish {{lang|es|espada}}, English \"spade\", and ''[[wikt:spadroon|spadroon]]''.

Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic [[alkaloid]] [[solanine]] and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \"true potato seed\", \"TPS\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be [[vegetative propagation|propagated vegetatively]] by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.\n\n== Genetics ==\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species.

These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the tubers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}</ref> In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh.

Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, [[diarrhea]], [[cramps]], and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.\n\nDifferent potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids.

In the US, this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potatoesusa.com/potato-products/seed-potatoes |title=United States Potato Board -Seed Potatoes|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> These locations are selected for their cold, hard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth.

During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, [[photosynthesis]] begins as the plant develops leaves and branches above-ground and [[stolon]]s develop from lower leaf [[axil]]s on the below-ground stem. In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell forming new [[tubers]] and the shoots continue to grow and flowers typically develop soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal [[soil moisture]] and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to [[Pest (organism)|pest attacks]]. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the [[Plant sugars|sugars]] in the tubers convert to starches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potatoes Home Garden |url=https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/lawn-and-garden/potatoes-home-garden/ |website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu |publisher=UF/IFAS Extension |accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JefferiesLawson1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Jefferies|first1=R.

Commercial growers cover them by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (called \"hilling\" up, or in British English \"earthing up\").

Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are [[roguing|rogued]] in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.\n\nPotatoes are sensitive to heavy [[frost]]s, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.\n\n=== Pests ===\n{{Main|List of potato diseases}}\nThe historically significant ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe<ref name=\"PlDis2011\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njf.nu/filebank/files/20060330$fil$vodD3dJE390Hb92eKsGd.pdf|title=NJF seminar No. 388 Integrated Control of Potato Late Blight in the Nordic and Baltic Countries.

Eastern Siberia.jpg|thumb|Potato flower close-up. Eastern Siberia]]\nAt harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong \"grape\" (or graip), i.e., a [[Garden fork|spading fork]], or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]] angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large [[potato harvester]]s, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.\n\nImmature potatoes may be sold as \"creamer potatoes\"{{anchor|creamer potatoes|new potatoes}} and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by \"grabbling\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested before it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a [[Yukon Gold potato]] or a red potato, called gold creamers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/fresh-direct/gold-creamer-potato|title=Calories in Fresh Direct Gold Creamer Potato|publisher=The Daily Plate, LLC|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"recipe tips\">{{cite web|url=http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--35863/creamer-potato.asp|title=Creamer Potato|publisher=recipetips.com|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high in moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of [[starch]] than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared by boiling, baking, frying, and roasting.<ref name=\"recipe tips\" /> Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \"new potatoes\"{{anchor|new potato}}, which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the same varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Randal|first=Oulton|date=24 July 2006|title=Creamer Potatoes|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/creamer-potatoes|website=CooksInfo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPotatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.<ref>Kleinkopf G.E. and N. Olsen. 2003.
